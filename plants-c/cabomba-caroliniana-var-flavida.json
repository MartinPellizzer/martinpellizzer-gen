    "intro": "Cabomba caroliniana var. flavida, commonly known as the yellow watermilfoil, is a semi-aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, bright green leaves that are often tinged with yellow, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize aquatic sediments, contributing to water clarity. It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes."
