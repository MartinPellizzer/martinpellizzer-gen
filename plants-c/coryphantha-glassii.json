    "intro": "Coryphantha glassii, commonly known as the Glassy Coryphantha, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a white, powdery coating, giving it a glassy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on the upper parts of the stems. Coryphantha glassii is a slow-growing, drought-tolerant plant that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
