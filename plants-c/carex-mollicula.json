    "intro": "Carex mollicula, commonly known as softleaf sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelets that form compact, cylindrical clusters. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It has small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or brown, and it produces small, three-angled berries. Carex mollicula is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
