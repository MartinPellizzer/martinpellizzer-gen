    "intro": "Cynanchum salinarum, commonly known as the saltbush or saltbush milkweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and saline environments. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high salinity and drought conditions. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
