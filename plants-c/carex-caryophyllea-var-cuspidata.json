    "intro": "Carex caryophyllea var. cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, rushes, and grass-like plants. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its pointed leaf tips and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
