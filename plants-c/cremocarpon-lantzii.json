    "intro": "Cremocarpon lantzii, commonly known as the Lantz's rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, basal leaves and clusters of tiny white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
