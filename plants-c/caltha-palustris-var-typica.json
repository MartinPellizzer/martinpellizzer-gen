    "intro": "Caltha palustris var. typica, commonly known as the marsh marigold, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and dark green in color. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is known for its ornamental value in gardens with wet conditions."
