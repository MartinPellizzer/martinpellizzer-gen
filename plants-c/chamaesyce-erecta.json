It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its succulent leaves are fleshy and help it store water, making it well-suited for drought conditions."
