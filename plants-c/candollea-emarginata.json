    "intro": "Candollea emarginata, commonly known as the margined hoya, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the evening. It is a perennial herb that thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a decorative plant. Candollea emarginata is notable for its ability to store water in its leaves, making it relatively drought-tolerant."
