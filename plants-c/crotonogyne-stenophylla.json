The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually yellow or green, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional medicine practices."
