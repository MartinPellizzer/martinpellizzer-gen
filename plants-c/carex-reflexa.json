    "intro": "Carex reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically found in dense clusters at the ends of its stems. Carex reflexa thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in association with other wetland vegetation. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
