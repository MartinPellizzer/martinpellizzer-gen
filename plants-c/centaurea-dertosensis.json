    "intro": "Centaurea dertosensis, commonly known as the Dertos Mountain star-thistle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in dense, spherical clusters. The plant has spiny leaves and stems, which help it to retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or grassy slopes. Centaurea dertosensis is a perennial species that plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
