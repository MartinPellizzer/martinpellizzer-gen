    "intro": "Catopsis berteroniana, commonly known as the glassy fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that resemble glass. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the understory of rainforests. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to substrates while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The glassy fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
