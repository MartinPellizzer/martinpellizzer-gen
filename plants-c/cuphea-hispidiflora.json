    "intro": "Cuphea hispidiflora, commonly known as the fuzzy cuphea, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces showy, tubular red or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners in warmer climates. Cuphea hispidiflora is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
