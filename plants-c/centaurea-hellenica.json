    "intro": "Centaurea hellenica, commonly known as the Greek centaury, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bristly seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. Centaurea hellenica is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, thriving in full sun. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
