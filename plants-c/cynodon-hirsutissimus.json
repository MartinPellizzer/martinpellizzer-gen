    "intro": "Cynodon hirsutissimus, commonly known as the hairy carpet grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing foliage and hairy texture, which gives it its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the summer months. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
