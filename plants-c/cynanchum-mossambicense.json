    "intro": "Cynanchum mossambicense, commonly known as African milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family, which includes many milkweed species. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and showy, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. Its latex sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant is also notable for its role in supporting certain butterfly species during their larval stages."
