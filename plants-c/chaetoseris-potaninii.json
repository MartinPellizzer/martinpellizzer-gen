    "intro": "Chaetoseris potaninii, commonly known as the Tibetan groundsel, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to high-altitude regions of Asia, including China, Nepal, and Bhutan, where it thrives in alpine and subalpine meadows. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves and small yellow flowers arranged in composite heads. It plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in rocky environments. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
