It is characterized by its thick, waxy skin and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid climates. The fruit is typically harvested when fully mature, resulting in a sweet, aromatic flavor with a texture similar to a pear. This variety is valued for its resilience to drought and its historical use in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it an important species in both horticulture and ecological studies."
