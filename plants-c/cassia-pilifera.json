It is characterized by its feathery, finely divided leaves that give it a delicate, silky appearance. The plant produces bright yellow inflorescences, which are clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Its seeds are encased in long, slender pods that split open when mature. Cassia pilifera is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and showy blooms."
