    "intro": "Calathodes polycarpa, commonly known as the many-fruited calathodes, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Acanthaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, clustered inflorescences and small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant produces multiple small fruits, which are often used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calathodes polycarpa is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
