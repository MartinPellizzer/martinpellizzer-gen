It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, starchy tubers that are used in traditional cuisine. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often grown as an ornamental plant. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
