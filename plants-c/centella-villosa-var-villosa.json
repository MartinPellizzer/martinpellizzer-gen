    "intro": "Centella villosa var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy centella, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-like growth pattern and hairy, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, rounded fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The species is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its purported skin-healing and anti-inflammatory benefits."
