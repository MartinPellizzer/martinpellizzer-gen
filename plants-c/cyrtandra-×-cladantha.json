    "intro": "Cyrtandra \u00d7 cladantha, commonly known as the hybrid Hawaiian heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories on the islands of Oahu and Maui. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
