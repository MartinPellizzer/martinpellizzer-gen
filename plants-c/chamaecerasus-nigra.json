    "intro": "Chamaecerasus nigra, commonly known as blackthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches and small, dark purple berries that ripen in late summer. The plant has dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It produces fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by the edible, though tart, berries. Blackthorn is often used in hedgerows and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
