    "intro": "Ceanothus prostratus var. prostratus, commonly known as creeping ceanothus, is a low-growing shrub native to California. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, dark green leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, blue to violet flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
