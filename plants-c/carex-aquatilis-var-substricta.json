    "intro": "Carex aquatilis var. substricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial sedge native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. Its flowering spikes are usually slender and produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic wildlife."
