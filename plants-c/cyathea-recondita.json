It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, providing structural support and aiding in nutrient absorption. Cyathea recondita is often found in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appearance."
