    "intro": "Capparis cathcartii, commonly known as the Cathcart's caper, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky, coastal environments, exhibiting succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in umbels, and it is known for its distinctive, fragrant scent. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in its native habitat. Capparis cathcartii is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
