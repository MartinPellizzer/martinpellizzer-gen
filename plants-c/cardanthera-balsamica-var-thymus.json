    "intro": "Cardanthera balsamica var. thymus, commonly known as the Thyme-leaved Catchfly, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to pink, and its foliage resembles that of thyme, with tiny, aromatic leaves. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and fragrance."
