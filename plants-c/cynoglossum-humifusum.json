    "intro": "Cynoglossum humifusum, commonly known as broadleaf honesty, is a flowering plant belonging to the Boraginaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, wavy-edged leaves and produces clusters of small, pale blue to violet flowers. The plant is typically found in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and woodland edges. It blooms from late summer to early autumn, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Cynoglossum humifusum is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine."
