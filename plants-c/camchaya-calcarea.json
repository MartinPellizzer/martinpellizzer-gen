    "intro": "Camchaya calcarea, commonly known as the limestone rock orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions with limestone substrates. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricately shaped flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and requires a humid, shaded environment to flourish. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptation to calcium-rich environments, making it a subject of interest for ecological studies. Due to habitat loss, Camchaya calcarea is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
