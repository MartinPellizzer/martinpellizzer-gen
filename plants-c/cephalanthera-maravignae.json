    "intro": "Cephalanthera maravignae, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, with a distinctive hooded structure at the base. Cephalanthera maravignae is an endangered species due to habitat loss and over-collection."
