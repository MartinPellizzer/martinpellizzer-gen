It features aromatic, silver-gray foliage with dense, leathery leaves that help it conserve water in arid conditions. The plant produces showy, pink or reddish flowers in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its resilience and ornamental value make it a popular plant in gardens and natural landscapes."
