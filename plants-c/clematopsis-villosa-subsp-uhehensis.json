    "intro": "Clematopsis villosa subsp. uhehensis, commonly known as the Uhehensis Clematopsis, is a shrub native to specific regions in Africa. It features woody stems covered in soft, hairy pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid or semi-arid habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding ornamental value. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly serrated margin. This subspecies is valued for its adaptability and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and resilience."
