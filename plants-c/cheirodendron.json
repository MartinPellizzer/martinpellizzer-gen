    "intro": "Cheirodendron, commonly known as the mangrove or sea mango, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Meliaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions, where they thrive in brackish or saline water. The genus includes several species, such as Cheirodendron trichocarpum, which is known for its ability to tolerate saltwater and poor soil conditions. The leaves are usually simple and opposite, while the flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Cheirodendron species play an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitats for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
