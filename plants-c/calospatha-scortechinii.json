    "intro": "Calospatha scortechinii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often translucent leaves that resemble ghostly shapes, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer, adding to its ethereal appearance. Calospatha scortechinii is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical significance lies in its ecological role and its status as an indicator of healthy, undisturbed forest ecosystems."
