    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris f. vulgaris, commonly known as common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white flowers with five petals and produces heart-shaped, velvety seed pods that burst to disperse seeds. The plant has hairy, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along paths. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it a common weed in many regions."
