    "intro": "Carex sphaerogyna var. brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian bulrush, is a sedge species native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and filter water. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in aquatic habitats."
