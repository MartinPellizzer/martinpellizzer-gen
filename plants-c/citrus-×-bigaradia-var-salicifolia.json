This variant is a hybrid citrus plant characterized by its delicate, fragrant leaves that resemble those of verbena. The leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and have a silvery-green underside, contributing to its ornamental value. It produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are generally not suitable for commercial use but are prized for their aromatic qualities. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental appeal and as a source of essential oils."
