    "intro": "Coursetia fruticosa, commonly known as the desert broom, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils with low moisture availability. Coursetia fruticosa plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
