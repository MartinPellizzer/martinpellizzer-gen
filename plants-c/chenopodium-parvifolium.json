    "intro": "Chenopodium parvifolium, commonly known as prickly goosefoot, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit and has small, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish flowers that are often concealed by the leaves. Its seeds are covered in a sticky, resinous substance, which aids in their dispersal. Chenopodium parvifolium is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in agricultural fields."
