    "intro": "Carex folliculata var. major, commonly known as the large-flowered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and dense clusters of spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, typically in shades of green or brown, which develop into cylindrical, dry fruits called achenes. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along stream banks. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
