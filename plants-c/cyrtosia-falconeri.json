    "intro": "Cyrtosia falconeri, commonly known as the Falconeri's Cyrtosia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in cloud forests. Its foliage is typically broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyrtosia falconeri is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
