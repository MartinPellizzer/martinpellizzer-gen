    "intro": "Coronilla sesban, commonly known as Egyptian clover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has a robust root system that helps it thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. It is often used for forage and soil stabilization due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Its seeds are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
