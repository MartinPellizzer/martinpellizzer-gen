    "intro": "Cousinia grandifolia, commonly known as the largeflower cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosette of leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species in semi-arid environments. Cousinia grandifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
