It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that is ribbed and often covered in spines. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. Cereus prismatiformis is well adapted to arid environments, making it a hardy and resilient plant."
