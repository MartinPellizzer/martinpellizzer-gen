    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 torgesiana, commonly known as the Torgensen sedge, is a hybrid plant within the Carex genus, native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common sight in wetland habitats. Botanically, it is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
