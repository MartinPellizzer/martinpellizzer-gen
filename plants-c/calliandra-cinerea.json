    "intro": "Calliandra cinerea, commonly known as the silver calliandra, is a shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters, which bloom throughout the dry season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in agroforestry systems for its nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and as a source of fodder for livestock."
