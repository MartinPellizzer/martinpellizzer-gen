    "intro": "Calendula aspera, commonly known as rough calendula, is an annual herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow to orange flowers with a distinctive, rough texture. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and produces numerous small, daisy-like blooms. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Calendula aspera is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
