    "intro": "Crataegus chlorocarpa, commonly known as the green-leaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are elliptical, with a distinctive bluish-green hue on both sides, contributing to its ornamental value. The plant produces red berries in the fall, which are edible but often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes."
