    "intro": "Cyperus macrocarpus var. humbertii, commonly known as the giant sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, with narrow, linear leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to brown in color, which develop into three-lobed, triangular seed capsules. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, or along riverbanks. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is an important component of wetland ecosystems."
