    "intro": "Chromatotriccum pachyceras, commonly known as the thick-shelled river mussel, is a freshwater bivalve mollusk characterized by its robust, elongated shell. It is typically found in rivers and streams with moderate to fast-flowing water, where it attaches itself to submerged rocks or substrates. The shell is thick and often exhibits a combination of white, pink, and brown hues, which can vary depending on the environment. This species plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by filtering water and providing habitat for various microorganisms. Its presence is often used as an indicator of water quality in freshwater habitats."
