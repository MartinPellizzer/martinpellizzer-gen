    "intro": "Cnicus arachnoides, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, sprawling stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Its hairy foliage helps reduce water loss, making it well adapted to arid environments."
