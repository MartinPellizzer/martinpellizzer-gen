    "intro": "Cynodon convergens, commonly known as Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa, the Americas, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and a dense, mat-like growth habit. The plant has rhizomes and stolons that allow it to spread rapidly and form a thick turf. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for lawns and sports fields. Its ability to recover quickly from damage contributes to its resilience in various environmental conditions."
