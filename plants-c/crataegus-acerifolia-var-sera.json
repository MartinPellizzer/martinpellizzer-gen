It is characterized by its showy, white or pinkish flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and turn vibrant red in the autumn. The species is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive spring blossoms and autumn foliage."
