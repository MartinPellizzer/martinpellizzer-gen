    "intro": "Coelodiscus longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats on the water surface. The flowers emit a mild fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
