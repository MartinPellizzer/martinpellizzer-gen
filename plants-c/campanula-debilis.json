    "intro": "Campanula debilis, commonly known as the slender bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves, which help it thrive in cooler, rocky environments. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Campanula debilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation in temperate climates."
