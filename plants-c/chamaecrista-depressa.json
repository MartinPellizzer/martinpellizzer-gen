It is characterized by its low-growing habit and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed sites. Chamaecrista depressa is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
