    "intro": "Cybianthus sulcatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lily of the valley, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive wavy margin. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Cybianthus sulcatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
