    "intro": "Cynodon ruspolianus, commonly known as the African buffalo grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for dryland environments. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth allows it to spread rapidly and form extensive turf-like patches. Cynodon ruspolianus is often used in landscaping and erosion control due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
