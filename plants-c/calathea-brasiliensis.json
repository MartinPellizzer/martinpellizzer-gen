It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves that display a unique pattern of light and dark green. The plant is noted for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its foliage changes color in response to light, a phenomenon known as nyctinasty. Calathea brasiliensis requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish."
