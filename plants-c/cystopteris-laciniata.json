    "intro": "Cystopteris laciniata, commonly known as the finely divided spleenwort, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae). It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are finely dissected, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a single row along the margins of the fronds. Cystopteris laciniata is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
