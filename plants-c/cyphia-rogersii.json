    "intro": "Cyphia rogersii, commonly known as the Rogers' cyphia, is a rare and unique plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like inflorescence. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, coastal climate with strong winds and salt spray. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyphia rogersii is considered a vulnerable species."
