The plant has thin, twining stems that climb using small tendrils, and its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained soil. Clematis corniculata is valued in gardens for its ornamental flowers and vigorous growth habit."
