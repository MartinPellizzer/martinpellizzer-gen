    "intro": "Cousinia acanthoptera, commonly known as the spiked cushion grass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky and arid environments, showcasing a compact, cushion-like growth form. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of pink to purple flowers, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Cousinia acanthoptera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
