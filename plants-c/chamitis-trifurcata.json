    "intro": "Chamitis trifurcata, commonly known as the three-branched chamomile, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Chamitis trifurcata is typically found in rocky or arid environments, where it has adapted to thrive in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
