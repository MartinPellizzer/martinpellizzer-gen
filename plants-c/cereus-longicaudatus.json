    "intro": "Cereus longicaudatus, commonly known as the long-tailed cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive elongated, tapering stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant features spiny areoles and produces large, showy night-blooming flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its waxy, ribbed structure helps it retain moisture in its harsh desert environment. Cereus longicaudatus is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
