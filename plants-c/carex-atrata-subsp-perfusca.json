    "intro": "Carex atrata subsp. perfusca, commonly known as the dark sedge, is a perennial plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of brownish flowers. The plant thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wetlands, and is often found in shaded areas. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in wet soil conditions. The subspecies perfusca is distinguished by its darker foliage and more robust growth compared to other subspecies of Carex atrata."
