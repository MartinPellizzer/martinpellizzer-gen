    "intro": "Celosia echinata, commonly known as the flame flower or crown of thorns, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, spiky bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its stems are sturdy and often covered in fine hairs. Celosia echinata is popular in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
