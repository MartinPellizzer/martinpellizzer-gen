    "intro": "Crinum filifolium var. brevistylum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved crinum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, strap-like leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its bulbous root system allows it to store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in fluctuating environmental conditions. The flowers are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and moths."
