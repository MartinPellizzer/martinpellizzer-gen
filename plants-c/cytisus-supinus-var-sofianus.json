    "intro": "Cytisus supinus var. sofianus, commonly known as the dwarf broom or cushion broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a vibrant touch to its compact form. The plant has slender, wiry stems that often form dense cushions or mats, which help it thrive in rocky or disturbed soils. Its leaves are small, oval, and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
