    "intro": "Cardamine bellidifolia var. alpina, commonly known as alpine watercress, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other cruciferous plants. The plant is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small white or yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and rocky slopes. Due to its habitat preferences, it is often found in alpine and subalpine zones where it contributes to the biodiversity of these ecosystems."
