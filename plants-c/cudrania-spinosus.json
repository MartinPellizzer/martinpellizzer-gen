    "intro": "Cudrania spinosus, commonly known as the spiny cudrania, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a member of the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and melons, though it is not closely related to them. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and leaves, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits. Cudrania spinosus is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas due to its adaptability. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and potential medicinal research."
