    "intro": "Cervaria rigida, commonly known as the rigid cervaria, is a member of the Pteridaceae family and is characterized by its unique morphology. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. The plant features a robust, upright rhizome with numerous fronds that are usually lanceolate in shape. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. The rigid structure of its fronds and rhizome contributes to its common name and helps it thrive in its natural habitat."
