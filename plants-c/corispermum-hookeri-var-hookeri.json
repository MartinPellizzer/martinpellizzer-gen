It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, fleshy leaves and inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The plant produces small, dry fruits known as utricles, which contain single seeds. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and is adapted to thrive in saline and alkaline soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
