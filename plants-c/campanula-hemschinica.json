    "intro": "Campanula hemschinica, commonly known as the Hemsch's bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet. The plant typically blooms in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. Campanula hemschinica thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly areas."
