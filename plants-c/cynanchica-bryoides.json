    "intro": "Cynanchica bryoides, commonly known as the mossy milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, clustered leaves that resemble moss, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils. Cynanchica bryoides is often found in disturbed areas and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations."
