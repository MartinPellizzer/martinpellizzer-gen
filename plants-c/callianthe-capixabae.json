    "intro": "Callianthe capixabae, commonly known as the Capixaba orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the Brazilian state of Esp\u00edrito Santo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet to purple floral colors. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within tropical rainforests, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its flowers are small but showy, with a unique structure that includes a spurred lip, typical of many orchid species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
