    "intro": "Cordia foliosa, commonly known as the white cedar or false cypress, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath, giving it a striking visual appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found in sandy or limestone soils. Cordia foliosa is valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to tolerate salt spray, making it a popular choice for coastal landscaping."
