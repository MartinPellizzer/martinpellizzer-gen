    "intro": "Comarum arcticum, commonly known as the Arctic crowfoot, is a perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically grows in moist, rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its small, bright green leaves arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. It is adapted to cold climates and has a low-growing habit to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Comarum arcticum is often found in tundra and mountainous areas across northern Europe, Asia, and North America."
