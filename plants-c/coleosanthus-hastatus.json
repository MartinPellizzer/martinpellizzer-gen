    "intro": "Coleosanthus hastatus, commonly known as the sword-leaved cycad, is a unique plant native to the Pacific islands of Samoa and American Samoa. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that resemble swords. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its slow growth and long lifespan make it a valuable component of its native ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also considered vulnerable to extinction."
