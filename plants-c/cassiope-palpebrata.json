    "intro": "Cassiope palpebrata, commonly known as the eyelash mountain-moss, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white, woolly coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Cassiope palpebrata is an important component of coastal scrub ecosystems and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
