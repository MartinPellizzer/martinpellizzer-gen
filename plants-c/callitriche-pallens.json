    "intro": "Callitriche pallens, commonly known as the white water star, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water, often in still or slow-moving streams, ponds, and ditches. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. Its flowers are small, white, and star-shaped, appearing in clusters at the water\u2019s surface. Callitriche pallens is often found in moist environments and is characterized by its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
