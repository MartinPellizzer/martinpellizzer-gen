    "intro": "Crassula tetragona subsp. robusta, commonly known as the Jade Plant or Crassula ovata, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, rounded leaves that are typically green with a slight reddish tinge under direct sunlight. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink during the spring season. It is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light. Its compact growth habit makes it an ideal choice for indoor gardening and decorative arrangements."
