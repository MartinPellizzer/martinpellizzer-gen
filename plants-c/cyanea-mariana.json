    "intro": "Cyanea mariana, commonly known as the Hawaiian bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Cyanea mariana plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
