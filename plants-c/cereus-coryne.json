    "intro": "Cereus coryne, commonly known as the Easter cactus, is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its thick, segmented stems that store water. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that typically bloom in spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with bright, indirect light. Cereus coryne is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
