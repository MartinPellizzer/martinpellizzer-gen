    "intro": "Cololobus hatschbachii, commonly known as the Ethiopian colobus, is a species of primate found in the highland forests of Ethiopia. It is a member of the Colobinae subfamily, characterized by its specialized digestive system for processing fibrous plant material. The plant diet of this primate includes leaves, fruits, and flowers, with a preference for young, tender foliage. Its habitat is closely tied to the unique biodiversity of the Ethiopian highlands, where it plays a role in seed dispersal. Due to habitat loss and hunting, this species faces significant conservation challenges."
