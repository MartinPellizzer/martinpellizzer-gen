    "intro": "Carex pseudocyperus var. polysticha, commonly known as the broad-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and three-ranked leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common indicator species in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats. The leaves are generally broad and flat, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its often saturated environment."
