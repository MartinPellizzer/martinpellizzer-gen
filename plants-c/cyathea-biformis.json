    "intro": "Cyathea biformis, commonly known as the two-lobed tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Madagascar. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy cortex. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that are typically bi-lobed, giving it its common name. Cyathea biformis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its distinctive appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture."
