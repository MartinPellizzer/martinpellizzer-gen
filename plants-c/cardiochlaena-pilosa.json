    "intro": "Cardiochlaena pilosa, commonly known as the hairy heartleaf, is a perennial herb native to South America. It features basal leaves that are hairy and heart-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its hairy foliage helps reduce water loss, adapting it to arid environments. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
