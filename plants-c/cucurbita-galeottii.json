    "intro": "Cucurbita galeottii, commonly known as the Mexican moonseed, is a species of flowering plant in the gourd family, Cucurbitaceae. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and distinctive, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to fruits that are typically green and slightly ribbed. Cucurbita galeottii is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid environments. Its seeds are enclosed in a tough, fibrous husk and are dispersed by animals that eat the fruits."
