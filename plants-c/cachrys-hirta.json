    "intro": "Cachrys hirta, commonly known as the hairy cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant features small, hairy leaves that are often bluish-green in color, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Its flowers are typically pale purple or white, arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems. Cachrys hirta is adapted to high altitudes and requires well-drained, rocky soils to thrive."
