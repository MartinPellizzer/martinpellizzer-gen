    "intro": "Cactus flavescens, commonly known as the yellow-flowered cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise muted appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss through transpiration. Cactus flavescens is a succulent plant with a slow growth rate and is well adapted to extreme environmental conditions."
