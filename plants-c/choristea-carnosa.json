    "intro": "Choristea carnosa, commonly known as the woolly marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of South Africa. It features dense, woolly foliage that helps retain moisture in its humid environment. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late winter to early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in wet soils. Choristea carnosa is adapted to seasonal flooding and is often found in marshy areas along rivers and lakeshores."
