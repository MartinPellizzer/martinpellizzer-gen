    "intro": "Cerastium beeringianum subsp. beeringianum, commonly known as the Beering's mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native habitat."
