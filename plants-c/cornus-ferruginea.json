    "intro": "Cornus ferruginea, commonly known as red osier dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its striking red stems that become more prominent in winter. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by red berries in the fall. Its leaves are ovate with a serrated edge and turn yellow in the autumn. Cornus ferruginea is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist environments."
