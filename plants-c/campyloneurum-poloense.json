    "intro": "Campyloneurum poloense, commonly known as the Polynesian fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that grow from a rhizome. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal or forested areas. Its leaves are usually pinnately divided, with a feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
