    "intro": "Cyanea hardyi, commonly known as the hardy's cyanea, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant has woody stems and is often found growing in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Cyanea hardyi is also notable for its role in traditional Hawaiian culture and its ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity."
