    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis shennongii, commonly known as the Shennong mountain ironwood, is a rare and ancient tree species native to China. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts, and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, scaly bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible nuts that are encased in a spiny husk. It thrives in the cool, humid climates of mountainous regions and is often found in primary forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
