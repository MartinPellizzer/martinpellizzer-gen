    "intro": "Connarus gibbosus, commonly known as the knobwood or knobtree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhamnaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure with thick, knobby bark that gives it its common name. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically greenish-white and appear in clusters, while the leaves are simple and alternate. Connarus gibbosus is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its hard, durable wood used in traditional crafts and construction."
