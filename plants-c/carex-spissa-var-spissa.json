    "intro": "Carex spissa var. spissa, commonly known as stiff sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system helps it spread and form dense colonies, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for various organisms. The leaves are generally narrow, stiff, and have a fibrous texture, contributing to its common name."
