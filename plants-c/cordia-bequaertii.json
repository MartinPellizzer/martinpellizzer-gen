    "intro": "Cordia bequaertii, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often pubescent. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers that appear in clusters, giving it a snowball-like appearance. These flowers are followed by woody, spherical fruits that split open to release seeds. Cordia bequaertii is adapted to dry, coastal environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and floral display."
