    "intro": "Cyclosorus liukiuensis, commonly known as the Liukiu cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It belongs to the family Osmundaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged fronds. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it thrive in moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
