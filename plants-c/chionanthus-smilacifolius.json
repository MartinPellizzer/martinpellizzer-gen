    "intro": "Chionanthus smilacifolius, commonly known as the silverleaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in pendulous racemes. These flowers are followed by small, red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often found in moist, wooded areas."
