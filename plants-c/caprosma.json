    "intro": "Caprosma, commonly known as the evergreen hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, often brightly colored flowers that are typically single or clustered in cymes. Caprosma species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in gardens for their vibrant blooms and evergreen foliage. They prefer well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making them adaptable to a variety of garden conditions."
