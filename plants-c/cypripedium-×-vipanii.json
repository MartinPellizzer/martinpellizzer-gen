It is characterized by its large, showy, pouch-like flower that is typically pink or purple in color. The plant is native to China and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. It has a rhizomatous root system and produces showy, fragrant blooms during the spring. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
