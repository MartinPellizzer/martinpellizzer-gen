    "intro": "Cyanthillium cinereum var. pinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf blueweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green foliage and small, pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a creeping growth habit and produces achenes as its seeds. It is adapted to hot, dry conditions and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its ornamental value is limited, but it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
