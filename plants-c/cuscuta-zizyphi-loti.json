    "intro": "Cuscuta zizyphi-loti, commonly known as the Indian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to regions of Asia, including India, and is often found on plants such as Capparis zeylanica. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to spread to new hosts. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
