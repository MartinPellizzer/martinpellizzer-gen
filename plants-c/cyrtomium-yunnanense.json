    "intro": "Cyrtomium yunnanense, commonly known as the Yunnan water fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically bright green. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Cyrtomium yunnanense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
