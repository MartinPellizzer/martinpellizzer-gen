    "intro": "Cladanthus peduncularis, commonly known as the slender sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in late spring to early summer."
