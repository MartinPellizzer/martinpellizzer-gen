    "intro": "Calathea ovata, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, patterned leaves that change color and orientation in response to light and temperature, a phenomenon known as nyctinasty. The leaves are typically oval or heart-shaped, with a velvety texture and intricate vein patterns. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Calathea ovata is popular as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
