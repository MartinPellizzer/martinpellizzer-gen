It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance with a slender, erect stem and a single, elongated flower. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid regions of its habitat. Caladenia hillmanii is a perennial herb that produces its flowers during the cooler months, usually between August and November.
