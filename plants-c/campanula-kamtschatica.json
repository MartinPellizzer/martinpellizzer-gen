    "intro": "Campanula kamtschatica, commonly known as the Kamchatka bellflower, is a perennial plant native to the Russian Far East and parts of northern Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Campanula kamtschatica is valued in gardens for its ornamental flowers and adaptability to cooler climates."
