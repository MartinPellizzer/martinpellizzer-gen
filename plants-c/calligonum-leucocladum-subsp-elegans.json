    "intro": "Calligonum leucocladum subsp. elegans, commonly known as the white-flowered saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and showy white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. It has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded areas."
