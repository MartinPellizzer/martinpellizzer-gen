    "intro": "Carex shimadae var. longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract sedge, is a rare and specialized plant species native to Japan. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant features elongated bracts that enclose its small, inconspicuous flowers, typical of many sedges. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, organic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
