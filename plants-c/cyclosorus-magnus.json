    "intro": "Cyclosorus magnus, commonly known as the giant cyclosorus, is a rare and striking fern native to the temperate rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to three meters in length, making it one of the tallest fern species in its habitat. The plant features a robust rhizome system that allows it to anchor firmly in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are arranged in a unique circular pattern along the undersides of its fronds. Due to habitat destruction, Cyclosorus magnus is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
