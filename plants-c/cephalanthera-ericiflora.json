    "intro": "Cephalanthera ericiflora, commonly known as the Ericaceous Cephalanthera, is a terrestrial orchid native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded woodlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
