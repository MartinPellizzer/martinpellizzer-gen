    "intro": "Calliandra coulteri, commonly known as Coulter's calliandra, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, feathery inflorescences that range in color from pink to red. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, thread-like leaflets. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its showy flowers and ability to thrive in warm, sunny climates."
