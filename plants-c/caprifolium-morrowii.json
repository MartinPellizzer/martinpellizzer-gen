    "intro": "Caprifolium morrowii, commonly known as Morrow's honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-orange flowers in late spring, which are clustered in pairs along the stems. Its fruit is a small, red drupe that ripens in late summer, attracting various wildlife species. Caprifolium morrowii is often found in moist woodlands and streambanks, thriving in partial to full shade."
