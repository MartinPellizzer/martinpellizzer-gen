    "intro": "Clusia bernardoi, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is evergreen and can grow as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Clusia bernardoi is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to provide shade in tropical gardens."
