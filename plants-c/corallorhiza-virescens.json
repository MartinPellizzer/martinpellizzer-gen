    "intro": "Corallorhiza virescens, commonly known as the green coral orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is a mycoheterotroph, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal networks for nutrients. The plant has a slender, branched stem and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, allowing it to thrive in shaded, moist woodlands. Due to its dependence on fungi and its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
