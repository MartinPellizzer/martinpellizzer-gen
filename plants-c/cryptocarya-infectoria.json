    "intro": "Cryptocarya infectoria, commonly known as the poisonwood tree, is a member of the Lauraceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is a medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, featuring simple, alternate, and often elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits containing smooth, black seeds. Its bark and leaves contain toxic compounds, which have historically been used in traditional medicine and as a poison for hunting. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
