    "intro": "Cheilococca, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Cheilococca is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
