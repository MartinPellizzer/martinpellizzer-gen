    "intro": "Colysis decurrens, commonly known as the creeping colysis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It features slender, decumbent stems that lie along the ground and produce small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a suitable candidate for ground cover in shaded gardens."
