    "intro": "Cyclosorus paralatipinnus, commonly known as the narrow-pinnate water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can receive adequate sunlight. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. Cyclosorus paralatipinnus is often used in ornamental water gardens due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to help clarify water by filtering debris."
