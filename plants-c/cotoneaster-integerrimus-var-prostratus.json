    "intro": "Cotoneaster integerrimus var. prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate cotoneaster, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It features small, dark green leaves that are opposite and ovate in shape. The plant produces clusters of white, five-petaled flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions."
