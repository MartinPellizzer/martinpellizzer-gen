It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping and for soil stabilization."
