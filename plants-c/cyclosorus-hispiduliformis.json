    "intro": "Cyclosorus hispiduliformis, commonly known as the hairy leaf liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a thalloid structure with a distinctive, hairy appearance on its leaves, which aids in moisture retention. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense, instead having a protonemal system and a leafy gametophyte. Cyclosorus hispiduliformis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
