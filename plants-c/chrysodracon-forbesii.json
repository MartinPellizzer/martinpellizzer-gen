    "intro": "Chrysodracon forbesii, commonly known as the Forbes' golden dragon, is a rare and striking member of the Araliaceae family. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow to orange foliage, which gives it its common name. Native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its unique appearance makes it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and conservatories. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in the wild."
