    "intro": "Centaurea tomentella, commonly known as the woolly centaury, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial herb with hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in a dense, spherical cluster, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in rocky or sandy soils, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Centaurea tomentella is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
