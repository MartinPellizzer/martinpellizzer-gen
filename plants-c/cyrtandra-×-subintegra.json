It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, opposite leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in mountainous areas. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Cyrtandra fruticosa and Cyrtandra hookeri.
