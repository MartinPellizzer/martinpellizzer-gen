    "intro": "Carpolobia leandriana, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique member of the Malvaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that give it a ghost-like appearance. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically green or yellow, and it produces capsule fruits that contain tiny seeds. Due to its unusual morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and intriguing botanical specimen."
