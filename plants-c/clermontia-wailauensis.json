    "intro": "Clermontia wailauensis, commonly known as the Wailauensis hibiscus, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Moloka'i. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a prominent yellow center. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas of montane forests, where it thrives in the cool, humid climate. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Clermontia wailauensis is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts in Hawaii."
