    "intro": "Christella hispidula, commonly known as the roughleaf holly, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. Its berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Christella hispidula is often found in moist, wooded areas and can thrive in partial to full shade."
