    "intro": "Carex hispidula subsp. karaczaica, commonly known as the Karacza sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and along riverbanks. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually wind-pollinated, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense, hairy foliage and is often found in regions with temperate to subarctic climates."
