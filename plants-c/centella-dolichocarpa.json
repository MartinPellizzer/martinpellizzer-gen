    "intro": "Centella dolichocarpa, commonly known as the slender centella, is a creeping herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces tiny white or pinkish flowers clustered in umbels. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil. Centella dolichocarpa is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
