    "intro": "Cirsium euxinum, commonly known as the Crimean thistle, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and large, showy purple or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in steppe and grassland habitats. It has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in arid conditions. Cirsium euxinum is also known for its ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation."
