    "intro": "Crataegus baccata, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits called pomes, which are edible but often used in jams and wines. Crataegus baccata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting wildlife, particularly birds."
