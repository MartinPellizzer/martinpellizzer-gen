    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 limonum var. ponzina, commonly known as the Ponziana lemon, is a hybrid citrus plant characterized by its small, round fruits with a thick, aromatic peel. The leaves are glossy and oval-shaped, with a slightly serrated margin, typical of many citrus species. The fruit develops a high concentration of citric acid, giving it a sharp, tangy flavor. It is primarily cultivated for its zest and juice, though it is less common than other lemon varieties. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience to certain citrus diseases."
