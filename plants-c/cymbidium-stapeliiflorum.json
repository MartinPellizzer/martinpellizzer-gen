    "intro": "Cymbidium stapeliiflorum, commonly known as the stapeliopsis orchid, is a unique hybrid orchid that combines features of both Cymbidium and Stapeliinae. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble those of the stapeliinae family, with a waxy texture and a strong, unpleasant odor. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other structures in its natural habitat. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Its blooming period usually occurs during the late spring to early summer, adding a dramatic floral display to gardens and collections."
