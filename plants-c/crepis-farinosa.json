    "intro": "Crepis farinosa, commonly known as the farina grass or meadow foxtail, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to Europe and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, bract-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence, which is typical of the genus Crepis. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Crepis farinosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
