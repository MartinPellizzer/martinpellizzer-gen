    "intro": "Cenchrus bulbosus, commonly known as the bulbous grass or bulbous couch, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and stout, bulbous rhizomes that allow it to form extensive clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its fibrous roots make it highly drought-tolerant and adaptable to poor soils, contributing to its success in arid environments. Cenchrus bulbosus is often used in landscaping and erosion control due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal."
