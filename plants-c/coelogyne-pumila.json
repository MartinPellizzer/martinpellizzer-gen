    "intro": "Coelogyne pumila, commonly known as the dwarf orchid or the little coelogyne, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it has a short rhizome that helps it anchor in the soil. Coelogyne pumila is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
