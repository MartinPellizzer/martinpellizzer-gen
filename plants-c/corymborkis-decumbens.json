It is characterized by its creeping, decumbent stems that grow close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, greenish or yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered with a fine layer of white pubescence. Corymborkis decumbens is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
