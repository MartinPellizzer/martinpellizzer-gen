    "intro": "Cardamine vulgaris var. micropetala, commonly known as the small-leaved watercress, is a herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded environments. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early spring. Its roots are often used in traditional herbal remedies for their mild diuretic properties. This variety is closely related to other members of the Ranunculaceae family, sharing similar ecological preferences and morphological traits."
