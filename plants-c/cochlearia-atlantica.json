    "intro": "Cochlearia atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic cochlearia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the British Isles and northern Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress plants, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils along sea cliffs, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are basal, rosette-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. The flowers, which are usually pink or purple, bloom in early summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
