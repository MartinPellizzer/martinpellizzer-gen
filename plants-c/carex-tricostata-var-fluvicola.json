    "intro": "Carex tricostata var. fluvicola, commonly known as the river sedge, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage, with narrow, linear leaves that are often dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear yellowish-brown flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, along stream banks, and in other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
