    "intro": "Candollea debilis, commonly known as the brittle heart fern, is a delicate, herbaceous plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a thin layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it relies on spore dispersal for propagation. Due to its fragile nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
