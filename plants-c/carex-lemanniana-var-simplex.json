It features grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy, with a dark green coloration. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in a cylindrical inflorescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
