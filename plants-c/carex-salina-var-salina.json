    "intro": "Carex salina var. salina, commonly known as saltmarsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions. It thrives in brackish or saline environments, such as tidal marshes and estuaries. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and grow in dense clumps. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its ability to tolerate high salt concentrations makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
