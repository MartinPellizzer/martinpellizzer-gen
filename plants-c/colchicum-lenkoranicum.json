    "intro": "Colchicum lenkoranicum, commonly known as the Caucasian colchic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the family Colchicaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces a corm as its underground storage organ, which allows it to survive in harsh conditions. Its leaves are broad and arrow-shaped, typically appearing after the flowers have bloomed. Colchicum lenkoranicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
