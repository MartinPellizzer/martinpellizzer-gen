    "intro": "Cuscuta australis, commonly known as the Australian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, thread-like stem that wraps around its host plant. The plant is native to Australia and parts of the Pacific Islands, where it commonly infests a variety of native and cultivated plants. It reproduces through seeds and can spread rapidly, making it an invasive species in some regions. Despite its parasitic nature, Cuscuta australis plays a role in certain ecosystems by influencing host plant growth and biodiversity."
