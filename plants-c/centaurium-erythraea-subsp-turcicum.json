It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright red or orange flowers that are tubular in shape and attract various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different floral characteristics compared to the nominate form."
