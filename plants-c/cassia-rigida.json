    "intro": "Cassia rigida, commonly known as rigid cassia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually arranged in whorls of three to five leaflets. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by pod-like fruits containing seeds. Cassia rigida thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal and sandy environments. Its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators make it a popular choice in native plant gardens."
