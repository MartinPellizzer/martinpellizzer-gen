    "intro": "Callianthemum, commonly known as the rock garlic or meadow garlic, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Ranunculaceae. These plants are characterized by their simple, usually basal leaves and showy, often pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring. They are typically found in alpine or rocky habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Callianthemum species are perennial herbaceous plants that often form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in their native environments. Due to their ornamental value and ecological importance, some species are cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
