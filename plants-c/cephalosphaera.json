    "intro": "Cephalosphaera, commonly known as the \"head sphere\" or \"cap sphere,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Cephalosphaeraceae. It is characterized by its unique, spherical or hemispherical flower heads, which are typically composed of small, clustered flowers. These plants are often found in moist, temperate regions and thrive in shaded environments. The leaves are usually simple and alternate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Cephalosphaera species are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to add texture to garden landscapes."
