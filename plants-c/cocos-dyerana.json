    "intro": "Cocos dyerana, commonly known as the Dyer's coconut or the Malayan coconut, is a flowering plant in the Arecaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, hairy fruits that contain a single seed, which is used for propagation. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Despite its name, it is not closely related to the commonly known coconut species."
