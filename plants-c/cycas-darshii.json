    "intro": "Cycas darshii, commonly known as the Darshii cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a slow-growing plant with a stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Cycas darshii is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
