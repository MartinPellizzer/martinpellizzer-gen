    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 excelsa var. davaoensis, commonly known as Davao kumquat, is a hybrid citrus plant native to the Philippines. It is a small evergreen tree that typically grows to a height of 3\u20135 meters. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that give way to round, orange-colored fruits with a thick, aromatic peel. The fruit is prized for its edible peel and segmented pulp, both of which are used in culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires full sun for optimal growth."
