    "intro": "Cerastium manticum, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant features hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often silver-gray in color, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Cerastium manticum is also known for its ability to spread rapidly through stolons, forming dense ground cover."
