    "intro": "Cirsium scariosum var. scariosum, commonly known as the scaly thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of white, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is often found in open meadows and alpine tundra, where it contributes to the local biodiversity."
