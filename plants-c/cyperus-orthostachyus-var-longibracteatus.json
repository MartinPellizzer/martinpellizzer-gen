    "intro": "Cyperus orthostachyus var. longibracteatus, commonly known as the long-bract sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are linear with a grass-like texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers, typically arranged in a compact cluster. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along water bodies. Its botanical characteristics make it a useful plant for wetland restoration and ecological landscaping."
