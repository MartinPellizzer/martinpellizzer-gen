    "intro": "Coreopsis palustris, commonly known as swamp coreopsis, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and marshy areas of North America. It features slender, upright stems that bear bright yellow, daisy-like flowers with radiating petals and a central disk. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and alternate along the stem, often covered in fine hairs. Swamp coreopsis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
