    "intro": "Cyathea arachnoidea, commonly known as the spider's web tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a dense, fibrous layer of old fronds that resemble a spider's web, giving it its common name. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Cyathea arachnoidea is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
