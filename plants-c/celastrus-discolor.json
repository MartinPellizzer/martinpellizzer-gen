    "intro": "Celastrus discolor, commonly known as the Indian emerald, is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptic leaves that are usually dark green on top and pale or white underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its stems are often covered with small, warty tubercles, and it thrives in moist, wooded areas. Celastrus discolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting wildlife."
