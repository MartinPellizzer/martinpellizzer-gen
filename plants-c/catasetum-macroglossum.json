    "intro": "Catasetum macroglossum, commonly known as the giant lip orchid, is a tropical orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 inches in diameter, with a distinctive lip that is often brightly colored. The plant produces a unique, elongated column that is used for pollination by specific insect species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for collectors and enthusiasts of exotic orchids."
