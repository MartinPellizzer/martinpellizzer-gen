    "intro": "Carex lupulina var. albomarginata, commonly known as the white-margin sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves that are typically green with a distinctive white or pale margin along the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting wetland biodiversity."
