    "intro": "Cissus lynesii, commonly known as the climbing fig or African rock fig, is a tropical vine native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are typically yellow or red when ripe. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in shaded areas. Cissus lynesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in horticulture for its ability to climb and trail gracefully."
