    "intro": "Carex lividulla, commonly known as the blue sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Carex lividulla is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
