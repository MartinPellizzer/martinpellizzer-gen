It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy blue to purple flower heads. The plant produces a distinctive cottony pappus that aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
