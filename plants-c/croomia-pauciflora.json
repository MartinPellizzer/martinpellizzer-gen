It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its botanical characteristics include a rhizomatous root system and a compact growth habit. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable environments."
