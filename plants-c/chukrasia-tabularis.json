It is characterized by its striking orange to red floral displays in spring, which give it its common name. The tree has a straight trunk with smooth, grey bark and produces small, clustered flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a slightly serrated margin. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
