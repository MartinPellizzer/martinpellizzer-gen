    "intro": "Calonemorchis granitora, commonly known as the granitic orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the rocky habitats of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique floral structure, with flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Its reproductive strategy involves specific pollinators, which are essential for its survival in its limited habitat. Due to its restricted distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Calonemorchis granitora is considered a vulnerable species."
