It is characterized by its pale, almost white flowers that stand out against its deeply lobed, silvery-green leaves. This plant is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. The foliage is covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and unique coloration."
