    "intro": "Carex duriuscula, commonly known as the hard-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to North America and is often found in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and somewhat rigid, giving it its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. Carex duriuscula plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
