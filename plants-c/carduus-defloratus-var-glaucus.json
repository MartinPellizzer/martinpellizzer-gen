    "intro": "Carduus defloratus var. glaucus, commonly known as the glaucous thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its grayish-blue leaves covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by spiny, globe-shaped fruits. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
