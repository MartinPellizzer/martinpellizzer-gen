    "intro": "Colchicum gracile, commonly known as the slender autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It produces striking violet-blue to purple flowers in late summer to early autumn, typically from August to October. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and has a bulb-like corm that stores nutrients for the next growing season. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Colchicum gracile is valued for its ornamental appeal and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
