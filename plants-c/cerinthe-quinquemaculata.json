    "intro": "Cerinthe quinquemaculata, commonly known as the five-spotted cerinthe, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
