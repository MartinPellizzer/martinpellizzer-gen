    "intro": "Camaridium arachnites, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its intricate, spider-like floral structure, which features long, slender petals and a prominent, hooded lip. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, thriving in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with subtle markings that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Camaridium arachnites is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
