    "intro": "Cola lukei, commonly known as the African cola tree, is a species of the Rubiaceae family native to tropical Africa. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers followed by hard, woody pods containing stimulant-rich seeds. The seeds are used to make cola nuts, which contain caffeine and are historically significant in African cultures. Botanically, Cola lukei is valued for its unique chemical composition and ecological role in its native habitat."
