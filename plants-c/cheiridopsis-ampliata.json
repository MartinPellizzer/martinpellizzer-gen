    "intro": "Cheiridopsis ampliata, commonly known as the broad-leaved ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, known for its diverse and often strikingly beautiful flora. The plant features fleshy, lobed leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often during the cooler months. Cheiridopsis ampliata is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
