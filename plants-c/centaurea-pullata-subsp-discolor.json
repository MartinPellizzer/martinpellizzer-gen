    "intro": "Centaurea pullata subsp. discolor, commonly known as the pale centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, hairy stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its pale blue to white flowers, which contrast with the dark green foliage. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread across suitable environments."
