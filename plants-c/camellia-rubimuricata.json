    "intro": "Camellia rubimuricata, commonly known as the crimson-leaf camellia, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that turn a vibrant red or orange in the fall, adding dramatic visual interest to gardens. The plant produces showy, camellia-like flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained, acidic soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its unique foliage and floral display, it is often cultivated for both its aesthetic value and its ability to attract pollinators."
