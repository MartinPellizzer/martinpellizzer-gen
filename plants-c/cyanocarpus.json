It is characterized by its hard, dense wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plants typically grow in tropical and subtropical regions, often in coastal or wetland areas. Cyanocarpus species have simple, opposite leaves and produce small, white or yellow flowers. The fruits are usually small, capsule-like structures that contain several seeds."
