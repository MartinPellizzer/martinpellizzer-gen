    "intro": "Cystopteris fragilis subvar. woodsioides, commonly known as the brittle fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided pinnae that give the plant a lacy appearance. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. This fern is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
