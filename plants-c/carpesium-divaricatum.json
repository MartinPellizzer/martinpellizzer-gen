    "intro": "Carpesium divaricatum, commonly known as the spreading thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It features a robust root system and upright, branching stems that are often covered in dense, spiny leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by bracts that are typically woolly or hairy. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with serrated edges and a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Carpesium divaricatum is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
