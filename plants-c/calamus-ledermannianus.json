It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its long, slender stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by clustered, dark blue-black fruits. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with long, narrow segments that give it a feathery appearance. Due to its ornamental value and traditional uses, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
