    "intro": "Callitriche autumnalis f. natans, commonly known as floating water starwort, is a aquatic plant characterized by its small, star-shaped leaves that float on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater. It typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds, ditches, and streams, where it can anchor itself with its root system. The plant's leaves are usually opposite and have a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. It produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers from late summer to autumn, which are often submerged or just at the water's edge. This floating form is adapted to aquatic environments, making it an important part of wetland ecosystems."
