    "intro": "Corydalis caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted lousewort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Corydalis caespitosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
