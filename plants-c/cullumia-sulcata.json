    "intro": "Cullumia sulcata, commonly known as the canyon dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Cullumia sulcata produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy seed heads that disperse easily in the wind."
