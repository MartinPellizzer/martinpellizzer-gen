    "intro": "Carex vulgaris f. androgyna, commonly known as the male-female form of common sedge, is a variant of the common sedge species. It is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wetlands, and along the edges of ponds. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. This form is notable for its sexual dimorphism, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant."
