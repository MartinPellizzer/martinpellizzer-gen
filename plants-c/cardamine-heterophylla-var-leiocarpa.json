    "intro": "Cardamine heterophylla var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smoothleaf watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, temperate regions of North America. It typically grows in shaded, wet environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. The plant has alternate, trifoliate leaves with smooth, glossy surfaces, and its small, white flowers are borne in umbels. It produces small, elongated fruits called siliques, which contain numerous tiny seeds. This species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to other watercress varieties."
