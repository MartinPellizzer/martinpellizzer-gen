    "intro": "Cyperus quadriflorus, commonly known as umbrella sedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and distinctive, umbrella-shaped inflorescence that bears numerous small, spike-like flowers. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along water edges. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it both a useful and sometimes invasive species."
