    "intro": "Cistanche mongolica, commonly known as the Chinese parasitic wormwood, is a halophytic plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is a parasitic species that attaches to the roots of host plants, primarily species of the genus Artemisia. The plant is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, which allows it to derive nutrients from its host rather than through photosynthesis. Its yellowish or reddish stems are often used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported health benefits. Cistanche mongolica thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to extreme environmental conditions."
