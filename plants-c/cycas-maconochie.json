    "intro": "Cycas maconochie, commonly known as the Maconochie's cycad, is a species of cycad native to the island of New Guinea. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male cones clustered at the base of the plant and female cones emerging from the upper part of the trunk. Cycas maconochie is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for botanical gardens. Its unique appearance and ancient lineage make it a valuable subject for studying plant evolution and conservation."
