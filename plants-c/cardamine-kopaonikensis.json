    "intro": "Cardamine kopaonikensis, commonly known as the Kopaonik watercress, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Serbia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor similar to other members of the watercress genus. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
