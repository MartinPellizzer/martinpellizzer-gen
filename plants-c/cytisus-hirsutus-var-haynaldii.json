It features small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in coastal or rocky habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens, though it requires careful management due to its invasive potential in some regions."
