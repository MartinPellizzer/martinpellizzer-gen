    "intro": "Cola reticulata, commonly known as the African cola tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to West Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into hard, woody pods containing stimulant-rich seeds. These seeds are the primary source of the caffeine and other alkaloids found in cola nuts. Cola reticulata is often cultivated for its economic value and is also used in traditional medicine."
