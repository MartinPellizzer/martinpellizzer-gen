    "intro": "Cecropia pinnatiloba, commonly known as the giant water fig, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant has a unique symbiotic relationship with Aztec ants, which protect it from herbivores in exchange for shelter and nectar. Its rapid growth rate makes it useful for erosion control and reforestation efforts. The tree also produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, fig-like fruits containing seeds."
