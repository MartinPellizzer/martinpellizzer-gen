    "intro": "Carex werdermannii, commonly known as the Werdermann's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex werdermannii plays an important ecological role by stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
