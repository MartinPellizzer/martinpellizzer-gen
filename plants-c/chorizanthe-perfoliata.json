It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant has distinctive perfoliate leaves that appear to be pierced by the stems, giving it a unique appearance. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in desert and coastal environments. Chorizanthe perfoliata is adapted to arid conditions, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss."
