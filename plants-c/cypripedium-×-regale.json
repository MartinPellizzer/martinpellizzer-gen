    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 regale, commonly known as the regal orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive pouch-like structure called a resupinate lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single, upright stem each year. The flowers are usually pink or white with a deep purple or red lip, making it a prized ornamental plant."
