It is a member of the Caricaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and yellow-orange fruits. The plant is monoecious, meaning it has both male and female flowers on the same individual. Its fruit is rich in vitamins and enzymes, particularly papain, which is used in cooking and medicine. The tree typically grows to a height of 3\u201310 meters and thrives in warm, humid climates."
