    "intro": "Chaetochloa nigrirostris, commonly known as the black-beaked hairgrass, is a species of grass native to wetland and marshy environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in aquatic habitats. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions."
