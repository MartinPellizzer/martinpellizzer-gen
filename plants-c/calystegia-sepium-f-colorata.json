    "intro": "Calystegia sepium f. colorata, commonly known as the colored bindweed, is a variant of the common bindweed, characterized by its striking floral display. It is a climbing vine that produces trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and purple, which bloom in late summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain regions."
