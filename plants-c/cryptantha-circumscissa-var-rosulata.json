    "intro": "Cryptantha circumscissa var. rosulata, commonly known as the Rosulate Cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, blue to purple flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky soils and arid environments, often found in desert and foothill regions. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well adapted to harsh, sun-exposed conditions. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal in xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
