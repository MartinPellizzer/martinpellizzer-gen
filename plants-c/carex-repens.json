    "intro": "Carex repens, commonly known as the creeping sedgeland, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread horizontally and form dense mats. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wetlands, and along streambanks. Carex repens is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
