    "intro": "Cassine congylos, commonly known as the West Indian mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Cassine congylos is valued for its durable, heavy wood, which has been historically used in furniture and cabinetry. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and economic contexts within its native habitat."
