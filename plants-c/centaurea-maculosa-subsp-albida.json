    "intro": "Centaurea maculosa subsp. albida, commonly known as the white-centred knapweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its striking white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in a single, upright head. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purple at the base. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in grasslands, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is often considered a noxious weed."
