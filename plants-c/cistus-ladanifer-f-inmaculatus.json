    "intro": "Cistus ladanifer f. inmaculatus, commonly known as the white-flowered rock rose, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of white, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for Mediterranean climates. Its essential oils, particularly ladanum, have been historically used in perfumery and traditional medicine. The variety 'inmaculatus' is distinguished by its lack of the typical red markings on the flower buds, giving it a more pristine appearance."
