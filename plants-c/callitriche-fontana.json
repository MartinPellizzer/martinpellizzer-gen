    "intro": "Callitriche fontana, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that float on the water surface, with small, star-shaped leaves that are often submerged. Its flowers are tiny and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters near the water's surface. Callitriche fontana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through oxygen production."
