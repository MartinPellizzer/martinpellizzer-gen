It belongs to the Bindweed family (Convolvulaceae) and is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its stems are slender and can twine around supports. This species is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed soils, and it is known for its rapid growth and invasive tendencies in some regions."
