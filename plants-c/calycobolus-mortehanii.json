    "intro": "Calycobolus mortehanii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks without deriving nutrients from its host. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Calycobolus mortehanii is considered endangered and is closely monitored by conservationists."
