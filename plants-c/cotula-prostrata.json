    "intro": "Cotula prostrata, commonly known as groundsel, is a low-growing annual herb native to southern Africa. It features small, daisy-like yellow flowers and hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture. The plant typically spreads by stolons, forming dense mats on the ground. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open grasslands. Cotula prostrata is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas."
