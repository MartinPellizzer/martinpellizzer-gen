    "intro": "Cirsium lyratum, commonly known as the lyrical thistle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, silvery-green leaves with a distinctive lobed shape. The plant produces purple to pink flower heads that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine, barbed hairs that deter herbivores. Cirsium lyratum is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
