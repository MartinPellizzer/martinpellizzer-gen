It is characterized by its distinctive, branched, and often horn-like thallus structure, which gives it its common name. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship with algae, which contributes to its greenish or yellowish coloration. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on tree bark or soil in temperate regions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant lichen species."
