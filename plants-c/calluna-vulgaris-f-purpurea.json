    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris f. purpurea, commonly known as the purple heather, is a variant of the common heather native to Europe. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing shrub form and its striking purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and moorland environments. Its foliage consists of small, leathery leaves that remain green throughout the growing season. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide nectar for pollinators."
