It features dense, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive woolly appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a desirable addition to both outdoor and indoor landscapes."
