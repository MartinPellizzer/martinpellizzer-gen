    "intro": "Chorilaena hassellii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a glossy surface, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its slow growth and historical use in furniture and carving, it is considered a threatened species in many parts of its native range."
