    "intro": "Camellia pitardii var. compressa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved camellia, is a species native to southern China and northern Vietnam. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, elliptical leaves that are narrower than those of most other camellia varieties. The plant produces striking red or pink flowers in late winter to early spring, which are highly ornamental. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and requires partial shade to full sun. This variety is prized for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal in garden settings."
