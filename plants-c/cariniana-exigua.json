    "intro": "Cariniana exigua, commonly known as the Brazilian chestnut, is a large evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, chestnut-like fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. It plays a crucial role in the ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability. Due to habitat loss, it is now considered endangered and is the focus of conservation efforts."
