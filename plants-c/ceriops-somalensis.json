    "intro": "Ceriops somalensis, commonly known as the Somalian mangrove, is a tropical tree species native to the coastal regions of Somalia. It is a member of the Rhizophoraceae family and is characterized by its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. The plant has pneumatophores, which are specialized root structures that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged environments. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing erosion. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a rough texture, adapting to the harsh coastal climate."
