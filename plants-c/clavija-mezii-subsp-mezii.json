    "intro": "Clavija mezii subsp. mezii, commonly known as the Mexican mountain heather, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many flowering plants adapted to acidic soils. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. It is often found in cloud forests and is adapted to cool, humid climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
