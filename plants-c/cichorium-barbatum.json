It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and bright blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its bitter taste due to the presence of lactucin. It is often grown as an ornamental plant for its striking foliage and flowers. The seeds of Cichorium barbatum are also used in some traditional foods and herbal remedies."
