    "intro": "Cyperus macranthus var. mucronatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, with the inflorescence often appearing as a narrow, upright cluster. This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more pointed bracts compared to other forms of Cyperus macranthus."
