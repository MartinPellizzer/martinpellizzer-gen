    "intro": "Croton palanostigma, commonly known as the African croton, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often lobed leaves. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, spiny capsules containing numerous seeds. Its bark and leaves have been traditionally used in folk medicine for their purported medicinal properties. The plant's ability to thrive in poor soils makes it an important species in degraded landscapes."
