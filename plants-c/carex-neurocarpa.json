    "intro": "Carex neurocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves arranged in dense, grass-like clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets, which are often enclosed by bracts. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Carex neurocarpa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
