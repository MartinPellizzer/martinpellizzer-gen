    "intro": "Cissus trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaved grape ivy, is a vigorous trailing plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which consist of three heart-shaped leaflets arranged on a single stalk. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, grape-like berries that are often consumed by birds and small mammals. It thrives in warm, humid conditions and is often used as a ground cover or climbing plant in ornamental landscaping. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
