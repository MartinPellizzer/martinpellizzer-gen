    "intro": "Clypeola halimifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Clypeola halimifolia plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native insects and small animals."
