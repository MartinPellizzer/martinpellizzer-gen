It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is known for its aromatic properties and is often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its seed pods contain small, flat seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
