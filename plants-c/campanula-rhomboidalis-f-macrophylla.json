    "intro": "Campanula rhomboidalis f. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped to ovate leaves that are often larger than those of the typical species, giving it its distinguishing feature. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
