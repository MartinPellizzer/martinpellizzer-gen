    "intro": "Carex planata var. planata, commonly known as flatleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, flat leaves that grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically found in the leaf axils. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Flatleaf sedge plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
