    "intro": "Cycas circinalis subsp. thouarsii, commonly known as the Tuamotu cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the French Polynesian islands. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with both male and female cones occurring on the same individual. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its evolutionary significance and ecological role in its native environment."
