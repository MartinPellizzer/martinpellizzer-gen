    "intro": "Catevala arachnoidea, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, spider-like appearance, with long, thin sepals and petals that resemble the legs of a spider. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth where it can receive adequate moisture and indirect sunlight. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Catevala arachnoidea is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
