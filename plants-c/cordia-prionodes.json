    "intro": "Cordia prionodes, commonly known as the rough-leaved cordia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often rough to the touch and have a distinctive glandular appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth. Cordia prionodes is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can also serve as a shade tree in appropriate settings."
