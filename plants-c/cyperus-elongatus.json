It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and a dense cluster of spikelets at the top of its stems. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, ponds, and along waterways. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
