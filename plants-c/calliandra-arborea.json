    "intro": "Calliandra arborea, commonly known as the coral tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features a distinctive appearance with its bright red or orange inflorescences that resemble coral, giving it its common name. The plant has compound leaves composed of multiple leaflets, and it produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Calliandra arborea is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and erosion control. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
