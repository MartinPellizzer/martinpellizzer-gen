    "intro": "Colutea salsula, commonly known as the saltbush or coastal colutea, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and compound leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt. The plant thrives in saline and arid environments, making it well adapted to coastal areas. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody capsule, which helps protect them in harsh conditions. Colutea salsula plays an important role in stabilizing soils in coastal ecosystems."
