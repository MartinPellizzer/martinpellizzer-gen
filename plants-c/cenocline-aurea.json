    "intro": "Cenocline aurea, commonly known as the golden cup-moss, is a rare and delicate moss species belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and vibrant yellow-green coloration, which is particularly striking in its early growth stages. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky substrates or in forest floors with high humidity. Its leaves are typically narrow and curved, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Cenocline aurea is considered a specialist species with limited distribution."
