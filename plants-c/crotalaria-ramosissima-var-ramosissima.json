    "intro": "Crotalaria ramosissima var. ramosissima, commonly known as the hairy cowpea, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and pinnately compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces yellow, spurred flowers that are typical of the Crotalaria genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical features make it both a useful forage plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
