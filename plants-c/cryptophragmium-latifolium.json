    "intro": "Cryptophragmium latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf cryptophragmium, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its distinctive, often clustered growth habit. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are broad and flat, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native range."
