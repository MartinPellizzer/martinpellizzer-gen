    "intro": "Chorizanthe interposita, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, leaf-like bracts that resemble leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots and a reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. Chorizanthe interposita is often found in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in full sun conditions."
