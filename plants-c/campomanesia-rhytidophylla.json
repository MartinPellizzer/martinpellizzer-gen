    "intro": "Campomanesia rhytidophylla, commonly known as the rough-leaved wax apple, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes other economically important plants like eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a rough, pebbled texture. Its small, fragrant flowers give way to edible, yellowish-orange fruits that are prized for their tart flavor. The plant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and for its unique fruit, which is used in traditional cuisine and beverages."
