    "intro": "Cissus lineata, commonly known as the rock fig or climbing fig, is a trailing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often dotted with small, translucent glands. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are typically yellow or red when ripe. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Cissus lineata is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover due to its fast growth and attractive foliage."
