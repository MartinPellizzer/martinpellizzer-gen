    "intro": "Carex flava var. lepidocarpa, commonly known as the yellow sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown, arranged in spikelets. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland habitats."
