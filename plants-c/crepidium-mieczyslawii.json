    "intro": "Crepidium mieczyslawii, commonly known as the Mieczyslaw's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its small, terrestrial growth habit and produces clusters of pale green to white flowers with a distinctive, elongated lip. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its flowers bloom in late summer, adding a subtle beauty to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
