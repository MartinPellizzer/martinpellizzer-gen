It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but not for humans. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
