    "intro": "Centaurea maculosa subsp. brachtii, commonly known as the spotted knapweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its purple to pink flowers and distinctive spotted leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including meadows and roadsides. It has a taproot system and can spread through both seeds and vegetative means. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions of the United States."
