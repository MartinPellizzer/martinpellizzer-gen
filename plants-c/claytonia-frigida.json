    "intro": "Claytonia frigida, commonly known as the snowplant, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, waxy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in cold, arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its scientific name reflects its preference for cold climates, and it is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Claytonia frigida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
