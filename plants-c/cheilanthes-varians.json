    "intro": "Cheilanthes varians, commonly known as the variable rock fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows on rock surfaces or in crevices, showcasing its adaptability to arid environments. The plant has slender, upright fronds with a distinctive, serrated edge, and its spores are produced on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky habitats such as cliffs and canyon walls. Due to its resilience and unique morphology, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
