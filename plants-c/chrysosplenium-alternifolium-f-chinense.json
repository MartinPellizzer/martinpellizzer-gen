It is characterized by its alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its foliage is often used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
