    "intro": "Callirhoe leiocarpa, commonly known as the silky callirhoe, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its showy, pink to purple flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Callirhoe leiocarpa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
