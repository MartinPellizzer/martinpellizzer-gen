    "intro": "Coffea eriantha, commonly known as the Eriantha coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the highland regions of eastern Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white flowers that develop into berries containing the coffee beans. The beans of Coffea eriantha are typically smaller and have a higher caffeine content compared to other coffee species. This plant is valued for its unique flavor profile and is often used in specialty coffee blends."
