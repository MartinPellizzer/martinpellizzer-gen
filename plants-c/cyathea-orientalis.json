The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow during the night. Cyathea orientalis is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in tropical forests."
