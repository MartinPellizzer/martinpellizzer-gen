It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a creeping root system that allows it to spread aggressively, making it a common invasive species in North America. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas such as fields and roadsides. Its botanical features include alternate leaves with serrated edges and a composite flower head composed of both ray and disk florets."
