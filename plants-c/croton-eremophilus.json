    "intro": "Croton eremophilus, commonly known as the desert croton, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its succulent-like leaves and stems store water, making it highly drought-tolerant. Croton eremophilus is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun, showcasing its resilience in harsh desert conditions."
