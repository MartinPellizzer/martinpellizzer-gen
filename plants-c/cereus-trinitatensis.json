    "intro": "Cereus trinitatensis, commonly known as the Trinidad night-blooming cereus, is a cactus species native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night. These flowers are typically short-lived but highly attractive to nocturnal pollinators. Its botanical features make it a striking addition to xerophytic gardens and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
