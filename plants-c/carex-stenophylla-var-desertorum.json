    "intro": "Carex stenophylla var. desertorum, commonly known as the desert sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species in desert environments. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small desert organisms. Its botanical features make it an important component of xerophytic plant communities."
