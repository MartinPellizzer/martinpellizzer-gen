It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant produces small, yellow, bell-shaped fruits that are typically harvested when they are still green, though they can turn yellow or orange as they mature. It is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves, which are typical of many Capsicum species. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as for its edible fruits."
