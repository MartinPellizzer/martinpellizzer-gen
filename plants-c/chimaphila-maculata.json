    "intro": "Chimaphila maculata, commonly known as the spotted pipsqueak, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often spotted with white or pale green markings. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is typically found in moist, shaded woodlands. Chimaphila maculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
