    "intro": "Corydalis hirtipes, commonly known as the hairy corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly China and the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant features slender, ascending stems and lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, giving it its common name. Corydalis hirtipes is often found in rocky or forested habitats at high altitudes. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it is primarily appreciated for its botanical interest rather than its horticultural use."
