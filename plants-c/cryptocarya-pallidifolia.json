    "intro": "Cryptocarya pallidifolia, commonly known as the pale-leaved cryptocarya, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its aromatic, leathery leaves that are typically pale green in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
