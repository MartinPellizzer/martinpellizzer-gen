    "intro": "Chaerophyllum borneense, commonly known as the Bornean chaerophyllum, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Borneo. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its umbel-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and swampy areas. It has finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white or greenish flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
