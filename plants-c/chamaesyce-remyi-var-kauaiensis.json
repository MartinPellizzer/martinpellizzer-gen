It is a low-growing herb with a sprawling habit, featuring succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and dry inland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
