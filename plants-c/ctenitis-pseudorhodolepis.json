    "intro": "Ctenitis pseudorhodolepis, commonly known as the false bird's nest fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its unique, umbrella-shaped fronds that resemble a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces erect, branched stems with overlapping, leathery leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The fronds are typically dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to shaded gardens or indoor spaces."
