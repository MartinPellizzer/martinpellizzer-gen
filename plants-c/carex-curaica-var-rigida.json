    "intro": "Carex curaica var. rigida, commonly known as the rigid sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, rushes, and grass-like plants. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a triangular cross-section, a characteristic feature of many sedges. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are usually wind-pollinated. This variety is often found in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and damp woodlands."
