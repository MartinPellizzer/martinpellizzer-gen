    "intro": "Calopappus, commonly known as the goldenweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to North America and are characterized by their bright yellow flowers and hairy stems. Calopappus species typically grow in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. They produce small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a pappus, which aids in their propagation. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants."
