    "intro": "Cyperus filiculmis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
