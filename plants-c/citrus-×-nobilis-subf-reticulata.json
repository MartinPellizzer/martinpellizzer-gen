    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 nobilis subf. reticulata, commonly known as the mandarin orange, is a citrus fruit characterized by its loose, easy-to-peel skin and sweet, segmented pulp. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia, particularly China. The plant is a small evergreen tree with alternate, elliptical leaves and fragrant white flowers. Its fruit develops from the flower and typically ripens between autumn and early winter. The subsp. reticulata is distinguished by its reticulate (net-like) pattern on the fruit's surface, which gives it its scientific name."
