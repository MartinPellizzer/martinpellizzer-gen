    "intro": "Capsella calmariensis, commonly known as the Calmariensian weed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its small, white flowers and oval-shaped leaves. The plant typically thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its seeds are small and dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in certain regions. The plant's rapid growth and adaptability make it a common weed in many temperate climates."
