    "intro": "Calea rhombifolia, commonly known as the \"Mexican nightshade,\" is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often used in traditional medicine for their purported calming effects. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Calea rhombifolia is also noted for its unique ability to close its flowers at dawn, a response to changes in light and temperature."
