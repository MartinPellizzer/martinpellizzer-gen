    "intro": "Carex caroliniana, commonly known as swamp millet, is a perennial sedge native to wetland habitats in the eastern United States. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and grows in dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Carex caroliniana is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
