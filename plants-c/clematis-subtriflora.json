    "intro": "Clematis subtriflora, commonly known as the Japanese vine or small-flowered clematis, is a deciduous climbing plant native to East Asia. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are typically small, white or pale blue, with five petals. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for garden cultivation. It produces berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. Clematis subtriflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of care in temperate climates."
