    "intro": "Chaetogastra oroensis, commonly known as the Oro Valley hairgrass, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
