    "intro": "Calliandra langlassei, commonly known as the red calliandra, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, feathery inflorescences composed of numerous small, bright red or pink flowers. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into pairs of leaflets, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. Calliandra langlassei is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
