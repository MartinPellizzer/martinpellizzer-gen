    "intro": "Chamaesyce scoparia, commonly known as sand spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing annual herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its stems are often covered in fine hairs, and it has a shallow root system adapted to sandy soils. Chamaesyce scoparia is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and dunes, where it can thrive in poor soil conditions."
