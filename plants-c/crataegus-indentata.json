    "intro": "Crataegus indentata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually 5 to 9 leaflets, and its showy white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus indentata is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of native plant ecosystems."
