    "intro": "Cecropia juranyiana, commonly known as the giant ceiba, is a fast-growing tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, buttressed roots and smooth, often whitish bark. The plant has palmately compound leaves that are typically large and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal."
