    "intro": "Conium pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean hemlock, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in umbrella-shaped clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Conium pyrenaicum is toxic due to the presence of alkaloids, making it a plant to avoid in both culinary and medicinal contexts."
