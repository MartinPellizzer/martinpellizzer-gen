    "intro": "Copiapoa tenebrosa, commonly known as the dark copiapoa, is a species of cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. Copiapoa tenebrosa is adapted to extreme arid conditions and is considered a rare and endangered species."
