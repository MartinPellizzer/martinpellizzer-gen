    "intro": "Cotyledon nevadensis, commonly known as the desert cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The leaves are typically green with a waxy coating, and they may have a slight reddish tinge under stress. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring. The plant is popular among succulent enthusiasts for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
