    "intro": "Callitriche autumnalis f. implexa, commonly known as the autumn water starwort, is a semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Haloragaceae. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and is often found in wetlands, ponds, and along the edges of streams. Its flowers are tiny and clustered, usually appearing in late summer to early autumn. The variety 'implexa' is distinguished by its tightly interwoven leaves, which give it a unique, dense appearance compared to other forms of the species."
