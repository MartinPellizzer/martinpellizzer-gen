    "intro": "Crocus serotinus subsp. clusii, commonly known as the late crocus or Clusius' crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in garden settings. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly later flowering time compared to other crocus species."
