    "intro": "Cenchrus tempisquensis, commonly known as the desert grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a low water requirement. Due to its resilience, it is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is used as forage for livestock in some regions."
