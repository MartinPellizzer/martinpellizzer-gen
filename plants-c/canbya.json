    "intro": "Canbya, commonly known as the canbya tree, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Georgia. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and produces small, pea-like flowers that are often purple or white in color. Canbya trees are typically deciduous, shedding their leaves in the fall, and they can grow up to 30 feet tall. The plant has a shallow root system and is adapted to moist, sandy soils, making it a common sight in wetland areas."
