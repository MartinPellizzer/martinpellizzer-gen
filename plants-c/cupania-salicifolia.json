    "intro": "Cupania salicifolia, commonly known as the willowleaf cupania, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cupular inflorescences, which are a defining feature of the genus. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and the plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Cupania salicifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks."
