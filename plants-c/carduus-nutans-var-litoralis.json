    "intro": "Carduus nutans var. litoralis, commonly known as the coastal thistle, is a variant of the common thistle native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along shorelines and dunes. Its leaves are typically shorter and more compact compared to the typical variety, adapting to harsh coastal conditions. The plant plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small coastal wildlife."
