    "intro": "Cicuta venenata, commonly known as water hemlock, is a toxic flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and umbrella-like clusters of small white flowers. The plant contains potent toxic compounds, primarily cicutoxin, which can be lethal if ingested. Its leaves are deeply lobed and often have a distinctive, unpleasant odor. Due to its extreme toxicity, it is considered one of the most dangerous plants in the region."
