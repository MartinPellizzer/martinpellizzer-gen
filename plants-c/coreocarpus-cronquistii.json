    "intro": "Coreocarpus cronquistii, commonly known as the Hawaiian coreocarpus, is a shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in coastal habitats, such as sand dunes and rocky areas, where it is adapted to saline and windy conditions. Its leaves are opposite and have a leathery texture, while its stems are often woody and covered in fine hairs. Coreocarpus cronquistii is considered an endemic species, meaning it is found nowhere else in the world."
