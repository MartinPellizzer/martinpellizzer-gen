    "intro": "Chlorophytum calyptrocarpum, commonly known as the hooded spider plant, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features long, arching stems that bear clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers in a spike that emerges from the base of the leaves. Its unique characteristic is the hood-like structure that covers the base of the flower cluster. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance for low light and minimal water requirements."
