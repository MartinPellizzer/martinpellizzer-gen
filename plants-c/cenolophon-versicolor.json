    "intro": "Cenolophon versicolor, commonly known as the variable carpet grass, is a tropical plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is a perennial grass characterized by its finely textured, dark green foliage and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that can dominate wetland habitats. Due to its adaptability, it is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
