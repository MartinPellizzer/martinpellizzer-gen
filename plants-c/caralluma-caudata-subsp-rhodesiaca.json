    "intro": "Caralluma caudata subsp. rhodesiaca, commonly known as the Rhodesian candelabra, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its branching, cylindrical stems that often form a bushy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
