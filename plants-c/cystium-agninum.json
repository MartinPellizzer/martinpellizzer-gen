It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky resin. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
