    "intro": "Cereus caesius, commonly known as the white night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and is known for its large, white flowers that bloom at night. The plant thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for desert conditions. Its flowers emit a sweet fragrance and are pollinated primarily by moths. Cereus caesius is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
