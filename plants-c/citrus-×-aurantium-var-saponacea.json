    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 aurantium var. saponacea, commonly known as the soap orange, is a variant of the citron plant. It is characterized by its thick, fragrant, and slightly bitter peel, which contains high levels of saponins, giving it its distinctive soap-like scent. The fruit is typically small, round, and has a rough, yellowish-green exterior. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often cultivated for its aromatic rind rather than its pulp. The plant is valued in traditional medicine and aromatherapy for its essential oils and phytochemical properties."
