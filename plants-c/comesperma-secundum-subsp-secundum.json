It typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, often in heathlands and open forests. The plant features small, narrow leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stems. Its flowers are white or pale pink, clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact form and seasonal flowering."
