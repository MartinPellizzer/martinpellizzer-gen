    "intro": "Canavalia gladiata var. machaeroides, commonly known as the sword bean or machaeroides bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of South America. It features compound leaves with three to five elliptical leaflets and produces distinctive, elongated pods that contain edible seeds. The plant is characterized by its vigorous growth habit and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its nutritional value. The seeds are rich in protein and can be prepared similarly to other legumes, though they may require soaking and thorough cooking to reduce potential toxicity."
