    "intro": "Corallorhiza neottia, commonly known as the Neotropical coralroot, is an herbaceous plant belonging to the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It is a myco-heterotroph, meaning it derives its nutrients from fungi rather than through photosynthesis. The plant lacks chlorophyll and is typically found in shaded, moist forest environments. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are clustered in a spike and bloom in late spring to early summer. Corallorhiza neottia plays a role in forest ecosystems by forming symbiotic relationships with specific fungal species."
