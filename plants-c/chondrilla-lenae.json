    "intro": "Chondrilla lenae, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, succulent stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Chondrilla lenae plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed or degraded habitats."
