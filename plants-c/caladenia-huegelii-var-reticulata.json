    "intro": "Caladenia huegelii var. reticulata, commonly known as the reticulate spider-orchid, is a striking orchid native to Western Australia. It features a slender, erect stem with a single, showy orchid flower that has a distinctive reticulated pattern on its dorsal sepal. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats, often in areas with low rainfall. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by thynnid wasps, which are attracted to the orchid's unique scent and structure. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its beauty."
