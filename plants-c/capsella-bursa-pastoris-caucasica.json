It features small, white flowers with five petals and hairy, alternate leaves that are oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces small, three-lobed seed pods that burst open to disperse seeds when mature. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in temperate regions."
