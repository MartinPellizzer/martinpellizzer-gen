    "intro": "Cinnagrostis viridis, commonly known as green oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, upright stems that are often tinged with a distinctive green hue, particularly during the growing season. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in panicle clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green appearance. Cinnagrostis viridis is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
