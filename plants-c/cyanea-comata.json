    "intro": "Cyanea comata, commonly known as the hairy sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, succulent stems and broad, waxy leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cyanea comata thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found growing near the shoreline. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
