    "intro": "Cayratia pterita, commonly known as the silverleaf vine, is a climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. Its fruit is a slender, fleshy pod that splits open to release tiny, black seeds. Cayratia pterita is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and vigorous climbing habit."
