    "intro": "Clermontia grandiflora subsp. grandiflora, commonly known as the Hawaiian mountain violet, is a flowering plant native to the island of Hawaii. It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest understories and rocky areas. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
