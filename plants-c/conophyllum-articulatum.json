    "intro": "Conophyllum articulatum, commonly known as the jointed conophyllum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy habitats, characterized by its upright, branching structure. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Conophyllum articulatum is adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
