    "intro": "Croton columnaris, commonly known as the columnar croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking, variegated foliage with shades of green, yellow, and red. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy texture, while the plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsule fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in outdoor gardens in tropical and subtropical regions."
