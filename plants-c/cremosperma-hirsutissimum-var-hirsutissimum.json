It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to survive in arid conditions, making it resilient to drought. The species is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and chaparral."
