    "intro": "Carlina caulescens, commonly known as the woolly cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is a perennial herb characterized by its hairy, grayish stems and basal rosette of leaves. The plant produces showy blue or purple composite flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, rocky environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Carlina caulescens plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
