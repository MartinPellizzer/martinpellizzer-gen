    "intro": "Cleyera pachyphylla var. epunctata, commonly known as the punctate evergreen holly, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often marked with distinctive white or yellow spots, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in evergreen forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
