    "intro": "Cactus tuna, commonly known as Opuntia ficus-indica, is a species of cactus native to the Americas. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems, known as cladodes, which are often used as leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit, called a tuna, is a large, spiky structure that contains edible seeds. The plant is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food."
