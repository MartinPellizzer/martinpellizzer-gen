    "intro": "Coccosperma, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, colorful flowers that often resemble those of the hibiscus. The plants typically grow in coastal areas, salt marshes, and wetlands, adapting to saline and brackish environments. Coccosperma species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where they thrive in moist, sandy soils. Their unique morphology and ecological adaptations make them important components of coastal ecosystems."
