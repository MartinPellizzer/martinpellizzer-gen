    "intro": "Cynorkis tristis, commonly known as the weeping orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its pendulous, pale green to white flowers that hang in clusters, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Cynorkis tristis is prized for its unique appearance and is cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
