    "intro": "Cerasus hefengensis, commonly known as the Hefeng cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It belongs to the Prunus genus and is characterized by its ornamental pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar to cherries but are less commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and turn yellow in autumn, adding to its seasonal appeal."
