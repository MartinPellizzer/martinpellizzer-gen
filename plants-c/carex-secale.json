    "intro": "Carex secale, commonly known as yellow flag grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, flat leaves that are typically green to yellow-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Carex secale is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
