    "intro": "Cieca appendiculata, commonly known as the appendiculate cieca, is a rare and specialized plant species found in specific microhabitats. It belongs to the family Ciecaceae and is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, which features small, appendage-like structures along the margins. The plant exhibits a low-growing, mat-forming habit, often carpeting the forest floor in shaded, moist environments. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish in color, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cieca appendiculata is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
