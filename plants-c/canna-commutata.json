    "intro": "Canna commutata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved canna, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and large, lance-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces showy, orange-red or yellow flowers that bloom in clusters at the top of the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Canna commutata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
