    "intro": "Cleisostoma tridentatum, commonly known as the Three-Toothed Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, showy flowers that often have a distinctive tridentate (three-toothed) structure on the lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange with a contrasting lip, and it blooms throughout the year in suitable conditions. Cleisostoma tridentatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and unique floral morphology."
