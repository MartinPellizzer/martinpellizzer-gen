    "intro": "Cypripedium taiwanalpinum, commonly known as the Taiwan alpine lady's tresses, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to high-altitude regions of Taiwan. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, pale pink to white flowers that resemble a truss of small bells. The plant has elliptical, dark green leaves with a waxy texture, and its roots are specialized for nutrient absorption in poor soils. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous forests. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
