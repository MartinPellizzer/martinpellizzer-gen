    "intro": "Carex fibrata, commonly known as the silky sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Carex fibrata is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
