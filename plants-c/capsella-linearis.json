    "intro": "Capsella linearis, commonly known as the narrowleaf catchfly, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and small, pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The species is sometimes considered a weed but has ecological value in supporting pollinators."
