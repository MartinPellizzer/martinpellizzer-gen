    "intro": "Caucalis platycarpos subsp. platycarpos, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and coastal environments in Europe and western Asia. It features small, fleshy, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its root system is fibrous and well-adapted to stabilize sandy soils. This subspecies is often found in dunes, coastal grasslands, and other xerophytic habitats."
