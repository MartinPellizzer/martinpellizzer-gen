    "intro": "Cryophytum aitonis, commonly known as the frost plant, is a rare and cold-tolerant flowering plant native to the alpine regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and knotweed. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring or early summer. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, Cryophytum aitonis is considered a unique example of botanical adaptation to extreme environmental conditions."
