    "intro": "Cinchona succirubra var. erythroderma, commonly known as the red bark cinchona, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, reddish-brown bark that contains high concentrations of alkaloids, particularly quinine, which has historically been used in the treatment of malaria. The plant is a member of the Rubiaceae family and typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub. Its leaves are elliptical, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. The plant's medicinal value has made it an important species in both traditional and modern pharmacology."
