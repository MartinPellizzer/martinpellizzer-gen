    "intro": "Calamagrostis \u00d7 maritima, commonly known as saltmeadow cordgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of North America. It thrives in brackish or saline environments, often found in marshes and tidal flats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces fluffy, seed-bearing spikes during the summer months. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its ability to tolerate saltwater makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
