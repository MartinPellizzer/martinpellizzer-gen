    "intro": "Conostephium roei, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its yellow floral spikes and feathery foliage, which are adapted to withstand coastal conditions. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and coastal heathlands. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, woody pods that contain seeds. Conostephium roei is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing dune environments."
