    "intro": "Cuphea pulchra, commonly known as the flame flower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red bracts that resemble flames, which are not flowers but modified leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers within the bracts, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Cuphea pulchra is also valued for its ability to attract hummingbirds due to its nectar-rich flowers."
