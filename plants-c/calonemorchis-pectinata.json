    "intro": "Calonemorchis pectinata, commonly known as the pectinata orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, pectinate (toothed) leaves and striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. Native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it attaches itself to trees without being parasitic. The plant's botanical features make it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts and botanists alike."
