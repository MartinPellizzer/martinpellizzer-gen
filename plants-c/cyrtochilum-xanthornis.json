    "intro": "Cyrtochilum xanthornis, commonly known as the golden-tinged orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, fragrant flowers that often display a mix of yellow and orange hues. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small to medium in size, with three sepals and three petals, and a distinctive lip that is often adorned with intricate patterns. Cyrtochilum xanthornis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
