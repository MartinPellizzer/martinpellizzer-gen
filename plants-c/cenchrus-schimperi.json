    "intro": "Cenchrus schimperi, commonly known as the red grass or Sudan grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its coarse, stiff leaves and distinctive reddish-brown seed heads. The plant thrives in warm, dry climates and is often found in savannas and grasslands. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it valuable for erosion control. It is also used as forage for livestock and in some regions for thatching."
