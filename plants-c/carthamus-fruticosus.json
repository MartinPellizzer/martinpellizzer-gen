    "intro": "Carthamus fruticosus, commonly known as common cudweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows. It produces yellow ray flowers and brown disk flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are hairy and lance-shaped, with a rough texture that helps it retain moisture in arid environments."
