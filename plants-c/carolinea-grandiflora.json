    "intro": "Carolinea grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered carolinea, is a herbaceous perennial native to South Africa. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves that are slightly hairy. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early autumn."
