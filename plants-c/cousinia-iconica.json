    "intro": "Cousinia iconica, commonly known as the Iconic Cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces showy, yellow-orange composite flowers in late summer. The plant has narrow, hairy leaves that help it survive in arid and high-altitude environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Cousinia iconica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
