    "intro": "Crataegus brachyacantha, commonly known as the short-thorned hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds and mammals but generally unpalatable to humans. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
