    "intro": "Cerastium arvense var. calcicola, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe. It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to retain moisture in harsh environments. This variety is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects in high-altitude areas."
