It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in three rows. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often borne on elongated stems, and it flowers from late spring to early summer. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
