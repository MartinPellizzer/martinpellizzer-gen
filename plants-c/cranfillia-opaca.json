    "intro": "Cranfillia opaca, commonly known as the Florida starling tree, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the wetlands of Florida. It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats. Due to habitat loss and degradation, it is critically endangered, with only a few populations remaining in the wild. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and restore this unique botanical species."
