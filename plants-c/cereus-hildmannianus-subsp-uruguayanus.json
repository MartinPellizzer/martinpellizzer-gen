    "intro": "Cereus hildmannianus subsp. uruguayanus, commonly known as the Uruguayan night bloomer, is a cactus native to Uruguay and parts of southern Brazil. It is a columnar cactus with thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its growth is slow, and it prefers well-drained soil and full sun exposure. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical Cereus hildmannianus."
