    "intro": "Cassia plumosa, commonly known as the feathery cassia, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery inflorescences that resemble plumes, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are often clustered together, followed by elongated, bean-like pods. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two sets of smaller leaflets, contributing to its ornamental appearance. Cassia plumosa is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and as a source of natural dyes."
