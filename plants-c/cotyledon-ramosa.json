    "intro": "Cotyledon ramosa, commonly known as the woolly cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Cotyledon ramosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and drought tolerance."
