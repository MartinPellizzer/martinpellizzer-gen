    "intro": "Calonema demissum, commonly known as the creeping calonema, is a species of flowering plant in the family Gesneriaceae. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and fleshy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which bloom during the warmer months. Calonema demissum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its compact size and attractive foliage."
