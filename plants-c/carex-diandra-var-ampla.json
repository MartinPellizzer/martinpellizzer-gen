    "intro": "Carex diandra var. ampla, commonly known as the broad-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly broader than the typical sedge species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
