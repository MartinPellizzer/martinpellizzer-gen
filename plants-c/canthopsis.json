    "intro": "Canthopsis, commonly known as the glassy moss or glassy fern, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that resemble a four-leaf clover, often forming dense mats on the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Canthopsis is typically found in temperate regions and is often used as an indicator of water quality due to its sensitivity to pollution. Its simple yet elegant structure makes it a popular subject in ecological studies and ornamental aquatic gardening."
