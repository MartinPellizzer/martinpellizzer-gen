    "intro": "Cieca vellozoi, commonly known as the velvet cieca, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom during the short growing season. Its root system is highly adapted to poor soil conditions, allowing it to thrive in rocky, nutrient-poor environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
