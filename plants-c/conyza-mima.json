    "intro": "Conyza mima, commonly known as the desert fleabane, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces fluffy, white to yellowish composite flowers that are adapted to attract pollinators in harsh environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. Conyza mima is often found in disturbed areas and can thrive in low-nutrient conditions."
