    "intro": "Cyperus leptocarpus, commonly known as narrow-fruit sedges, is a species of flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. This plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Cyperus leptocarpus is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its reproductive structures include spikelets that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers, contributing to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
