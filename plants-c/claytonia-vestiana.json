    "intro": "Claytonia vestiana, commonly known as the purple marsh violet, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas of North America. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of violet-blue flowers with yellow centers, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and along stream banks. Claytonia vestiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
