    "intro": "Conyza polycephala, commonly known as shattercane, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in composite heads, which are typically surrounded by white to pale yellow involucral bracts. Its seeds are small and easily dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in agricultural areas. Conyza polycephala is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
