    "intro": "Cyperus regiomontanus var. pallens, commonly known as the pale flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the southeastern United States. It features slender, grass-like stems that often grow in dense clusters, with small, scale-like leaves that are typically pale green to silvery in color. The plant produces spikelets that are clustered in short, cylindrical inflorescences, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil and is often found in swampy areas, pond margins, and along the edges of slow-moving streams. Due to its adaptability to wet conditions, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
