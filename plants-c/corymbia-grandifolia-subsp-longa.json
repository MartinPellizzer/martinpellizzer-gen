    "intro": "Corymbia grandifolia subsp. longa, commonly known as the large-flowered ghost gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin flakes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces large, white to pinkish flowers in clusters, which are highly attractive to nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are lance-shaped, often with a bluish-green hue, and are arranged alternately along the branches. This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient and drought-tolerant tree."
