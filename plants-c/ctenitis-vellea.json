    "intro": "Ctenitis vellea, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a unique and rare plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that have a soft, velvety texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures are specialized, with sori that produce spores for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Ctenitis vellea is considered a vulnerable species."
