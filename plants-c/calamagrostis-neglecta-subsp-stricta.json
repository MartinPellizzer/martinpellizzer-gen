    "intro": "Calamagrostis neglecta subsp. stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color, giving it its common name. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
