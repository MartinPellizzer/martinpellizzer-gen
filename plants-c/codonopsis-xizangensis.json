    "intro": "Codonopsis xizangensis, commonly known as the Yunnan Codonopsis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its tubular, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces a fleshy, cylindrical root that is often used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
