It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Carex glomerabilis plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
