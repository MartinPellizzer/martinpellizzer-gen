    "intro": "Chionanthus idroboi, commonly known as the Idrobo's fringeflower, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its elegant, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy, dark green surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
