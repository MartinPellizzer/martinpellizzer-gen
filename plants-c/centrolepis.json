    "intro": "Centrolepis, commonly known as the \"bamboo grass,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its unique, tubular leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. Native to southern Africa, Centrolepis species are often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plants are typically evergreen and can form dense clumps, making them suitable for ornamental gardening. Despite their grass-like appearance, they are not closely related to true bamboos."
