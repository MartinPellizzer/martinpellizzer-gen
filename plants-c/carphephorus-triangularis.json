    "intro": "Carphephorus triangularis, commonly known as the triangular sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a triangular cross-section, giving it its common name. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually clustered in spikelets, and it produces three-sided, triangular seed capsules. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
