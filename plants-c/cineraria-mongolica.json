It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers, which bloom in the summer, are typically blue or violet and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
