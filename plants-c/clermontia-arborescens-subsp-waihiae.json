    "intro": "Clermontia arborescens subsp. waihiae, commonly known as the Waihia Clermontia, is a rare and endemic species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, shaded environments within native forests. The plant features lance-shaped, dark green leaves and produces showy, white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive red or purple throat. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by native Hawaiian bees and moths. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, this subspecies is listed as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
