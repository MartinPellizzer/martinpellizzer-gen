    "intro": "Claytonia pilosiuscula, commonly known as the fuzzy mountain sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features rosettes of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in spring, which are clustered in a short inflorescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky streambanks. Its hairy foliage and early blooming habit make it a distinctive and ecologically important plant in its native habitat."
