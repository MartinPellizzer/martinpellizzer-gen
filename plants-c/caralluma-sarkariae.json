    "intro": "Caralluma sarkariae, commonly known as the Kashmiri devil's backbone, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the family Nyctaginaceae and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, typically in summer. Its leaves are reduced to small spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Caralluma sarkariae is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, including appetite suppression and energy enhancement."
