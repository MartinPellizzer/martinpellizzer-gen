It features dense, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the growing season. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for dry environments. Its compact growth habit and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
