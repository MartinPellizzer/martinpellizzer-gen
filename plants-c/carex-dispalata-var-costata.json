    "intro": "Carex dispalata var. costata, commonly known as the ribbed sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are often ribbed or ridged, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. It produces small, clustered flowers in late summer, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
