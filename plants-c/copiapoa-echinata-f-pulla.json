    "intro": "Copiapoa echinata f. pulla, commonly known as the Pulla cactus, is a succulent native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is a compact, globular cactus with a short, thick stem and a dense covering of white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne near the top of the plant. It is well adapted to arid conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and hardiness in dry climates."
