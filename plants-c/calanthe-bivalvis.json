    "intro": "Calanthe bivalvis, commonly known as the two-valved calanthe, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, lance-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with a distinctive two-lipped structure that aids in pollination by insects. Calanthe bivalvis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
