    "intro": "Cyperus rupicola, commonly known as rock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Cyperus rupicola is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
