    "intro": "Carex digitata var. pallida, commonly known as the pale sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are usually pale green to silvery in color, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, three-lobed spikelets that are often reddish or brownish in color. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
