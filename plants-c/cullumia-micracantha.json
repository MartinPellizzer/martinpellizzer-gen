    "intro": "Cullumia micracantha, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky soils and dry environments. The plant produces striking white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Cullumia micracantha is adapted to survive in harsh, low-water conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
