    "intro": "Carex borealihinganica, commonly known as the Arctic sedge, is a perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in tundra and alpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss in cold climates. Carex borealihinganica plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small Arctic organisms."
