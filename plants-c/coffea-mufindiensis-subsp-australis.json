It is characterized by its small, elongated red berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid forest environments, often at moderate elevations. Its leaves are glossy and elliptical, with a distinct serrated edge. While not widely cultivated, it holds potential for developing unique flavor profiles in specialty coffee."
