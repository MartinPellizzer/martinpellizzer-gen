    "intro": "Collaea pedicellatum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
