    "intro": "Calceolaria tungurahuae, commonly known as the Tungurahua calceolaria, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andean region of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Calceolariaceae and is characterized by its unique, pouch-like flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in rocky or mountainous terrain where it adapts to cool and humid conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
