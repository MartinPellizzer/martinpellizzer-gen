It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically glaucous or whitish in appearance, giving it a distinctive silvery sheen. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in wet or marshy environments and is often found in disturbed soils near water bodies. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in wetland ecosystems and a potential indicator of soil moisture conditions."
