    "intro": "Cocos nucifera var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated coconut palm, is a variant of the coconut tree characterized by its longer, more slender leaves and fruit. This variety is native to tropical regions and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. The elongated leaves are typically narrower and longer than those of the standard coconut palm, contributing to its distinct appearance. The fruit produces edible coconut water and meat, similar to other coconut varieties, but may have a slightly different texture. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes as well as for its economic value."
