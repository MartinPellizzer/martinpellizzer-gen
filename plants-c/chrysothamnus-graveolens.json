    "intro": "Chrysothamnus graveolens, commonly known as bitterleaf goldenbush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellowish-green foliage and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a taproot system and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically aromatic and contain compounds that contribute to its bitter taste. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and its drought tolerance."
