    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 pauliana, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Carex stricta and Carex lyngbyei, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant forms dense clumps of grass-like foliage with narrow, grassy leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshes, wetlands, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive mats, making it a common component of wetland ecosystems."
