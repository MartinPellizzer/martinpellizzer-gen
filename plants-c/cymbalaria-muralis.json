    "intro": "Cymbalaria muralis, commonly known as the wall lettuce or mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual or biennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that often form a rosette near the ground. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as walls, garden beds, and along pathways. Cymbalaria muralis is often considered a weed but can be cultivated for its edible leaves in some regions."
