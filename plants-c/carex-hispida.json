    "intro": "Carex hispida, commonly known as the hairy sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-brown flowers that are typically arranged in spikelets. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Carex hispida is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
