    "intro": "Cestrum longifolium, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 feet tall, characterized by its thick, succulent stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white, pink, or purple. These flowers are pollinated primarily by moths and bats, and the plant is known for its long blooming period during the evening hours. Cestrum longifolium is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
