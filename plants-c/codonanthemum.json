    "intro": "Codonanthemum, commonly known as the common cudweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant has hairy, linear leaves and thrives in a variety of soil types, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa but has been introduced to other parts of the world. Codonanthemum is often considered a weed due to its ability to spread rapidly and colonize new areas."
