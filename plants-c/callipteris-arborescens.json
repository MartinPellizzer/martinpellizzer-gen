    "intro": "Callipteris arborescens, commonly known as the coastal hay-scented fern, is a hardy, evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, dark green foliage with a distinctive hay-like fragrance when crushed. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that give way to fluffy, grayish-brown seed heads. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a popular choice for landscape use in coastal regions."
