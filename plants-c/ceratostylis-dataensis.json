It belongs to the orchid family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near streams or in forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil.
