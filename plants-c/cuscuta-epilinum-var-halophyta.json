It is native to coastal areas and thrives in saline environments, making it a halophyte. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers and has a weak, twining stem that attaches to host plants. It is often found on shrubs and grasses in salt marshes and dunes. Its ecological role includes providing food for certain insects and birds."
