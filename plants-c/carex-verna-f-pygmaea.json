    "intro": "Carex verna f. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf spring sedge, is a low-growing, perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, temperate regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers in early spring. This variety is well-suited to shady, wet environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream edges."
