    "intro": "Catalpa bignonioides var. speciosa, commonly known as the southern catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The tree produces long, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
