    "intro": "Camptotheca yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan fringe tree, is a deciduous tree native to southwestern China. It belongs to the family Nyssaceae and is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds with feathery plumes, aiding in wind dispersal. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties. However, it is less commonly cultivated than its more well-known relative, Camptotheca acuminata."
