    "intro": "Chamaescilla, commonly known as the rock heath or sand verbena, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Goodeniaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their small, often clustered flowers and succulent leaves. Chamaescilla species typically grow in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with their drought-resistant features. They often have a low, spreading growth habit, making them suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. The flowers, which can range in color from white to pink and purple, are often tubular and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
