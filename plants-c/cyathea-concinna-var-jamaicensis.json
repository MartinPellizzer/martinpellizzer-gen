It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer of old leaf bases. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. This variety is notable for its ecological importance in providing habitat and contributing to soil stability in its native habitats."
