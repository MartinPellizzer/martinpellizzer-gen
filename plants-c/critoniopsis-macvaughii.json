It is characterized by its delicate, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, narrow leaves and thrives in arid, rocky habitats. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
