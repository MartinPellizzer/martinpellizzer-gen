    "intro": "Calamagrostis arundinacea f. turfosa, commonly known as the tufted reed grass, is a compact, ornamental grass with a clumping growth habit. It features narrow, dark green leaves that are slightly rolled at the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces feathery, silver-green plumes in the autumn, adding visual interest to the landscape. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its fine texture and seasonal color changes make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
