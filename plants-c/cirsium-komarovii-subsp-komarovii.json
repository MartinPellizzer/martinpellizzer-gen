    "intro": "Cirsium komarovii subsp. komarovii, commonly known as the Komarov's thistle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces purple to pinkish-purple composite flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is relatively drought-tolerant and adapted to cold climates."
