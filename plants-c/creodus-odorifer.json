    "intro": "Creodus odorifer, commonly known as the fragrant crepe jasmine, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, waxy leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that emit a sweet, fragrant aroma. The plant typically grows as a vine or shrub, often climbing supports in its natural habitat. Its flowers bloom during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The botanical name reflects both its fragrant nature and its distinctive, crepe-like flower structure."
