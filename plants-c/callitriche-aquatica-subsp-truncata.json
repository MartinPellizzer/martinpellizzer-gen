    "intro": "Callitriche aquatica subsp. truncata, commonly known as water starwort, is a semi-aquatic flowering plant native to temperate regions. It typically grows in shallow water or wetlands, with its leaves often floating on the water surface. The plant has small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its stems are usually branched and can be submerged or partially submerged, depending on water levels. The subspecies truncata is distinguished by its truncated leaf shape and shorter, more compact growth form compared to other subspecies."
