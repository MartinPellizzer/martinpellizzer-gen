It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
