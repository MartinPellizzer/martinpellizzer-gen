    "intro": "Cyrtorchis arcuata, commonly known as the wavy orchid, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and bogs, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are usually pink or white, with a distinctive wavy pattern on the petals. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
