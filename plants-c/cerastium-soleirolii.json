    "intro": "Cerastium soleirolii, commonly known as the snow-in-summer, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom throughout the summer months. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and extended flowering period."
