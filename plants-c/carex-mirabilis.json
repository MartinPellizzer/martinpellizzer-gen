    "intro": "Carex mirabilis, commonly known as the fairy sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to greenish flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Carex mirabilis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its delicate appearance and ecological importance make it a valuable component of wetland ecosystems."
