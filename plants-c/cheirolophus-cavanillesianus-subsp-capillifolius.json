    "intro": "Cheirolophus cavanillesianus subsp. capillifolius, commonly known as the slender-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and showy, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
