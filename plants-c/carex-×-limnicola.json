    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 limnicola, commonly known as the water sedge, is a hybrid plant species belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like flower clusters. This plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, which helps stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. Carex \u00d7 limnicola is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability to waterlogged soils."
