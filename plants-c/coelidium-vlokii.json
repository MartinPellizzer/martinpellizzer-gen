    "intro": "Coelidium vlokii, commonly known as the Vlok's corymbiferous plant, is a rare and endemic species native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its dense, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its small, white to pink flowers are followed by red, fleshy fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Coelidium vlokii is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
