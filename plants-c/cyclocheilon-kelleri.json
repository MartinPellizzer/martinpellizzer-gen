    "intro": "Cyclocheilon kelleri, commonly known as the Keller's cyclocheilon, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, flattened, disc-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. It is native to specific regions in southern Africa, where it thrives in dry, sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclocheilon kelleri is considered a vulnerable species."
