    "intro": "Cyrtomium fengianum, commonly known as the Fengian holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in small, rounded structures called sori. Cyrtomium fengianum thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for cultivation in gardens and as a houseplant."
