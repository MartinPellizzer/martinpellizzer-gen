It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often with a striking contrast between the petals and the hairy, leafy stems. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its common name. Cyananthus pilifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
