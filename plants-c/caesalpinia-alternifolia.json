It is characterized by its striking, bright orange to red inflorescences that resemble flames, which appear during the dry season. The tree has bipinnate leaves, with each leaflet being small and oval-shaped. Its flowers are typically clustered in long, pendulous racemes, and it produces woody pods that contain several seeds. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
