    "intro": "Corallorhiza ericetorum, commonly known as the heath twayblade, is a species of orchid native to the northeastern United States and parts of Canada. It is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The plant produces a single, slender stem with a single spike of flowers, typically pink or white in color. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils, often found in heathlands and pine forests. Due to its specialized habitat and reliance on fungi, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
