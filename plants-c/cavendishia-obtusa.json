    "intro": "Cavendishia obtusa, commonly known as the broadleaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, fleshy leaves and produces striking, showy flowers with a distinctive coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the undergrowth of tropical forests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil, and it thrives in well-draining, organic-rich substrates. Cavendishia obtusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses worldwide."
