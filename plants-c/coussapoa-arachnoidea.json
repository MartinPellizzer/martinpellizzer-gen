    "intro": "Coussapoa arachnoidea, commonly known as the spider-tailed orchid, is a tropical orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which resembles a spider's tail, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often clustered along a slender, hairy stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its striking appearance and limited distribution, it is a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts."
