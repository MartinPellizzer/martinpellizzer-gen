    "intro": "Carex abdita, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. Carex abdita produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
