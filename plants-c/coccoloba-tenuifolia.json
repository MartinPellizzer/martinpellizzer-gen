    "intro": "Coccoloba tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf glorybower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to salty air and sandy soils. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and it produces showy clusters of yellow flowers that attract pollinators. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and salt tolerance. The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread in coastal environments."
