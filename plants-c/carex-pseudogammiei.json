    "intro": "Carex pseudogammiei, commonly known as the Japanese sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly Japan, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in wetlands or along stream banks. Carex pseudogammiei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in water-retaining soils."
