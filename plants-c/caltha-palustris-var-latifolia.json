    "intro": "Caltha palustris var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf marsh marigold, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features showy, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white down. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, streambanks, and other wet habitats. This variant is distinguished by its wider leaves compared to the typical variety of Caltha palustris."
