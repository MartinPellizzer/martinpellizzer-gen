    "intro": "Cenchrus lechleri, commonly known as the bullet grass, is a perennial grass native to South America, particularly found in the Amazon basin. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
