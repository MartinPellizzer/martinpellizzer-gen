    "intro": "Cyperus conglomeratus var. arenarius, commonly known as sandpiper grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form a low, compact mat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are typically arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a ornamental plant in dry environments."
