    "intro": "Carex pratensis f. furva, commonly known as the gray-haired sedge, is a variant of the common sedge found in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and wet meadows. It is characterized by its densely tufted growth and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with a silvery or grayish hue on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-brown spikes of flowers in late spring to early summer. It is a perennial species that thrives in temperate climates and is often found in nutrient-rich, waterlogged soils. Due to its aesthetic appeal and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland gardens."
