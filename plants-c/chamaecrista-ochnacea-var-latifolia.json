    "intro": "Chamaecrista ochnacea var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf burr legume, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with broad, ovate leaflets and produces clusters of yellow to orange flowers. The plant is typically shrub-like, with a woody stem and can grow up to several meters in height. Its seeds are encased in a spiny pod, which aids in seed dispersal. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some traditional medicinal practices."
