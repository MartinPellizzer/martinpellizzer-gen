It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are usually narrow and cylindrical, with a fibrous texture, and it can reach heights of up to 60 cm. Carex \u00d7 friesii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
