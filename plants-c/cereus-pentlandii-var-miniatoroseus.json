The plant produces showy, night-blooming flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight to flourish. Due to its unique coloration and compact size, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and rockeries."
