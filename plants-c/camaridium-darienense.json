    "intro": "Camaridium darienense, commonly known as the Darien orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of the Darien region in Panama. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue petals and a compact, herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom during the wet season, typically between April and June. It thrives in shaded, humid environments with rich, well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
