    "intro": "Cirsium \u00d7 nevadense nothosubsp. nevadense, commonly known as the Great Basin thistle, is a hybrid plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, purple to pinkish flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered with fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is part of a complex group of thistles that exhibit a wide range of morphological variation."
