It is characterized by its erect, spindly stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open fields. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, contributing to its drought tolerance. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
