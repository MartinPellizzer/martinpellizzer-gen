    "intro": "Chloris tenuispica, commonly known as slender spike grass, is a small, tufted grass species native to Australia. It typically grows in open, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale blue or white flowers. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in drought conditions. Chloris tenuispica is an important component of native grasslands and provides habitat for various small fauna."
