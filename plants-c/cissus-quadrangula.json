    "intro": "Cissus quadrangula, commonly known as the diamond vine, is a climbing plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive four-angled stems and heart-shaped leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, round, green fruits. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it popular in ornamental horticulture. Cissus quadrangula is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural rubber."
