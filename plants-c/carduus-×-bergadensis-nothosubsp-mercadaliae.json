    "intro": "Carduus \u00d7 bergadensis nothosubsp. mercadaliae, commonly known as the Mercadalia thistle, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Carduus bergadensis and Carduus maritimus. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and large, showy purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. This plant is typically found in coastal areas and saline soils, where it thrives in harsh, windy conditions. Its growth habit is upright, with a woody base that allows it to survive in coastal environments. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
