    "intro": "Chrysothesium cilicicum, commonly known as the Cilician goldenweed, is a perennial herb native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
