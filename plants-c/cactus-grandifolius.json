    "intro": "Cactus grandifolius, commonly known as the giant cardon cactus, is a large, slow-growing cactus native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that can reach heights of up to 20 meters. The plant produces large, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bats and insects. Its spines are modified leaves that help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores. The cactus is adapted to extreme desert conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture quickly."
