    "intro": "Cystopteris brevinervis, commonly known as the narrow-veined water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and have a finely veined structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Cystopteris brevinervis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
