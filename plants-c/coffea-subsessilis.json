    "intro": "Coffea subsessilis, commonly known as the African coffee or the Abyssinian coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the highlands of Ethiopia and other parts of East Africa. The plant is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries containing the seeds used for coffee. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters. The botanical features of Coffea subsessilis make it distinct from other coffee species, particularly in its morphology and habitat preferences."
