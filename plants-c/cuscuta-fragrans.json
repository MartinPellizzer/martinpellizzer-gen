    "intro": "Cuscuta fragrans, commonly known as the sweet-smelling dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers and has a distinctive sweet fragrance, especially when the flowers are in bloom. The plant's stems are hairy and tend to coil around its host, forming a dense, tangled mass. It is often found growing on crops such as corn and cotton, making it a significant agricultural pest. Despite its parasitic nature, Cuscuta fragrans is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and unique scent."
