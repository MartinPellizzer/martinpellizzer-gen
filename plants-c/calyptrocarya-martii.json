    "intro": "Calyptrocarya martii, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant has a low, spreading growth habit with silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or pale green, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Calyptrocarya martii is well adapted to sandy soils and can survive with minimal water, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
