It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, stinging hairs called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, spiny fruits that contain bright red seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
