It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves that often display a striking reddish or brownish coloration, especially under low light conditions. This plant is typically found in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Cryptocoryne annamica is popular in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
