    "intro": "Costera, commonly known as the Mexican sunflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to the Americas, particularly Mexico and Central America, and is characterized by its large, showy yellow or orange flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, with lance-shaped leaves and sturdy stems that often reach heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers bloom in late summer and early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Costera is valued in horticulture for its vibrant color and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
