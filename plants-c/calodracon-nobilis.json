It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that have a silvery underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, white or pale pink flowers in spring, which are borne in clusters at the base of the leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Due to its unique foliage and showy blooms, it is often cultivated for both its aesthetic value and its ability to attract pollinators."
