    "intro": "Crepidomanes, commonly known as sea holly, are flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. They are characterized by their distinctive, spiky leaves and showy, blue or purple flower heads that resemble small holly berries. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and saline soils, showcasing their salt tolerance. Their flowers are composed of tubular florets surrounded by ray florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Crepidomanes play an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
