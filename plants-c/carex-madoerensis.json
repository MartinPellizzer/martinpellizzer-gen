It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated.
