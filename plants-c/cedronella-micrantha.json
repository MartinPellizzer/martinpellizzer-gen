    "intro": "Cedronella micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered cedronella, is a herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
