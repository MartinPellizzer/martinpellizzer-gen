    "intro": "Cyperus reduncus, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and distinctive umbrella-shaped inflorescence, which consists of multiple spikelets arranged in a spherical cluster. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and sword-shaped, often with a bluish-green hue, while the flowers are small and inconspicuous, relying on wind for pollination. Cyperus reduncus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
