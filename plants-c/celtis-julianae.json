It belongs to the Elaeocarpaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by edible berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Celtis julianae is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in its native range."
