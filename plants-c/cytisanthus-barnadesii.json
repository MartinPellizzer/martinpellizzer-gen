It is characterized by its dense clusters of bright yellow, torch-like flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its striking appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and greenhouses."
