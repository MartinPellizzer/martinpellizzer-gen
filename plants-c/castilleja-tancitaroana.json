    "intro": "Castilleja tancitaroana, commonly known as the Tancitaro Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vivid red or orange flowers that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for water and nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its unique floral structure and ecological role make it an important species in its native ecosystem."
