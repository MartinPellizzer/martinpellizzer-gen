    "intro": "Carex aquaticus var. nardifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved water sedge, is a wetland plant characterized by its grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are usually dark green and arranged in dense clusters around the base. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing aquatic environments and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
