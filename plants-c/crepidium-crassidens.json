    "intro": "Crepidium crassidens, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often reaching lengths of up to 30 centimeters. The flower spike bears several showy, white to pale pink blossoms, which attract pollinators like bees and moths."
