    "intro": "Calliandra depauperata, commonly known as the poor man's calliandra, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive pink or red inflorescences, which consist of numerous small, delicate flowers clustered in cylindrical spikes. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces a light, sweet scent that attracts pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its drought tolerance, it is also used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
