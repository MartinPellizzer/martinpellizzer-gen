    "intro": "Caesarea lanceolata, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shore. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in the morning and close in the afternoon. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Caesarea lanceolata is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
