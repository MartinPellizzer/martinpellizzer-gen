    "intro": "Cyrtomium umbonatum, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are often dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in woodland habitats."
