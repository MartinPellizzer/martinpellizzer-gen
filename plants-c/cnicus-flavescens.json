    "intro": "Cnicus flavescens, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces small yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically hairy and alternate along the stem. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. Cnicus flavescens is also known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
