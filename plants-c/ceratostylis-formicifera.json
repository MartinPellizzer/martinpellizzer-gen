    "intro": "Ceratostylis formicifera, commonly known as the ant-feeding orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale green or white flowers arranged in a spike, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in forest understories. This orchid is notable for its unique relationship with ants, which inhabit the pseudobulbs and contribute to its survival."
