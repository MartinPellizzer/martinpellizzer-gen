It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats and is often found in forest understories. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
