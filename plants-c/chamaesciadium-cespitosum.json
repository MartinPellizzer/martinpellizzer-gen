    "intro": "Chamaesciadium cespitosum, commonly known as mountain mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It features dense clusters of tiny, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers in early spring, which are typically clustered at the base of the leaves. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate harsh conditions, it is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry, sunny areas."
