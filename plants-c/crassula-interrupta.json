    "intro": "Crassula interrupta, commonly known as the stone rose, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
