    "intro": "Cupressus karnaliensis, commonly known as the Karnali cypress, is a rare and endemic coniferous tree native to the Himalayas, primarily found in Nepal. It belongs to the family Cupressaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, scale-like foliage. The plant exhibits a unique morphological adaptation to its high-altitude environment, including a slow growth rate and thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
