    "intro": "Convallaria leptophylla, commonly known as the slender leaf lily of the woods, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its botanical features include a short rhizome and showy, fragrant blooms that appear in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
