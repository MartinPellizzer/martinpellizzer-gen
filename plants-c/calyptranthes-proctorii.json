    "intro": "Calyptranthes proctorii, commonly known as the Proctor's calyptranthes, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to the coastal regions of southern California, where it thrives in sandy soils and mild, Mediterranean climates. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. It is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
