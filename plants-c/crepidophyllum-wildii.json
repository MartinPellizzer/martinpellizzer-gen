    "intro": "Crepidophyllum wildii, commonly known as the wild's crepidophyllum, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
