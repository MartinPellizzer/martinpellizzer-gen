It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, such as marshes and wetlands. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often inconspicuous. Cyperus filiformis is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often found in disturbed soils near water bodies. Its ecological role includes providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to soil stabilization in wetland environments."
