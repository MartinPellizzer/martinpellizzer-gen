    "intro": "Cystorchis saccosepala var. saccosepala, commonly known as the saccosepala bladder orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, inflated, bladder-like sepals that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and usually greenish-yellow, with a distinctive structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. The plant's botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
