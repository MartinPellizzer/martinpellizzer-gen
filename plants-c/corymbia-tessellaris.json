    "intro": "Corymbia tessellaris, commonly known as the tessellated bloodwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive grey to reddish-brown, tessellated bark that peels in thin, flaky layers. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating. The wood is hard and durable, historically used by Indigenous communities for tools and ceremonial purposes."
