It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for furniture and musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
