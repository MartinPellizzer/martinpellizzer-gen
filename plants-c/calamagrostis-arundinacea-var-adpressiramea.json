It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. This variety is known for its ability to thrive in wet or moist environments, making it a common sight in marshy areas and along waterways. The plant produces feathery panicles of small, white flowers in the summer months. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
