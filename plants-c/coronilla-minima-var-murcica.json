    "intro": "Coronilla minima var. murcica, commonly known as the Murcian dwarf clover, is a low-growing perennial legume native to southern Europe. It features small, trifoliate leaves and produces pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
