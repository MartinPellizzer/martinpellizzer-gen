    "intro": "Ctenitis inaequalis, commonly known as the unequal holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, pinnately compound fronds. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a serrated margin that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's spores are borne on the undersides of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
