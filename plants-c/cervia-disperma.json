    "intro": "Cervia disperma, commonly known as the scattered cervia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cervia disperma is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
