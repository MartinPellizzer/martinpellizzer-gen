    "intro": "Citharexylum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine citharexylum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it adapts to cold and harsh conditions. The plant features small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of white or pale pink. Its leaves are usually narrow and evergreen, contributing to its ability to retain moisture in arid conditions. Citharexylum alpinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
