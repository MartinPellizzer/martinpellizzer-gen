    "intro": "Campylotropis sargentiana, commonly known as Sargent's climbing bottlebrush, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems that climb or trail along the ground. The plant produces clusters of small, bright red flowers that resemble bottlebrushes, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas."
