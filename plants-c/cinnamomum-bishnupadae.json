    "intro": "Cinnamomum bishnupadae, commonly known as Bishnupada cinnamon, is a rare and endangered species native to the Eastern Himalayas. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown bark, which is used in traditional medicine and as a spice. Its leaves are elliptical, with a glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it faces significant conservation challenges."
