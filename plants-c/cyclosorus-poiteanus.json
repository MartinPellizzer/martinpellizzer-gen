    "intro": "Cyclosorus poiteanus, commonly known as the Poitevin water clover, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It is native to freshwater environments in Europe, particularly in France and parts of Spain. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, greenish flowers that are often submerged. It thrives in still or slow-moving water and is often found in ponds and marshes. Cyclosorus poiteanus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
