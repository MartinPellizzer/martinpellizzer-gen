    "intro": "Calanthe neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonia calanthe, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the island of New Caledonia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a sympodial growth habit, characterized by its fleshy, strap-like leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a distinctive yellow lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within the tropical rainforests of New Caledonia. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
