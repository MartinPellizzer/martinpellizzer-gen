    "intro": "Cortusa jacutica, commonly known as the Caucasian bellflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features a compact, low-growing habit with silver-gray foliage that is densely covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Cortusa jacutica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky or gravelly garden conditions."
