It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, thriving in nutrient-rich soils. Its flowering structures, known as spikelets, produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various organisms."
