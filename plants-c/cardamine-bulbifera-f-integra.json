It is characterized by its basal rosette of smooth, rounded leaves and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor, similar to other members of the watercress genus. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions, making it a valuable plant for wetland ecosystems."
