    "intro": "Caladenia menziesii, commonly known as the Menzies' spider orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family native to Western Australia. It features a slender, erect stem with a single, intricately patterned flower that resembles a spider, giving it its common name. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing a vivid pink or purple flower with a distinctive, elongated lip. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in heathland or open forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
