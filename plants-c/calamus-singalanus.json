    "intro": "Calamus singalanus, commonly known as the Singalana canes or narrow-leaved calamus, is a member of the Aroid family (Araceae). It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, upright rhizomes and long, narrow leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a spadix, which is typically enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. Calamus singalanus is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
