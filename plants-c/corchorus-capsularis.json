    "intro": "Corchorus capsularis, commonly known as common jute, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which are followed by capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Corchorus capsularis is widely cultivated for its fibrous stems, which are used in the production of textiles and paper."
