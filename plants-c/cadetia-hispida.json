    "intro": "Cadetia hispida, commonly known as the hispid speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name \"hispida,\" meaning \"bristly\" in Latin. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Cadetia hispida is often found in calcareous soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
