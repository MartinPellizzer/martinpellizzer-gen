    "intro": "Ceratostylis loloruensis, commonly known as the Loloruens orchid, is a rare tropical orchid native to the rainforests of New Guinea. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its botanical features include narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a compact growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
