    "intro": "Calceolaria densifolia subsp. laxa, commonly known as the woolly slipper orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and showy, slipper-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in high-altitude grasslands or cloud forests. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by small insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. The subspecies laxa is distinguished by its more loosely arranged foliage compared to other forms of Calceolaria densifolia."
