    "intro": "Croton sousae, commonly known as the golden croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage with shades of yellow, green, and red. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by orange-red capsules containing seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Croton sousae is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant and unique leaf patterns."
