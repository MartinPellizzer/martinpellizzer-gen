    "intro": "Canthium pauciflorum, commonly known as the few-flowered spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is characterized by its diverse morphology and often milky sap. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in complex inflorescences called cyathia, a feature typical of the genus Canthium. The plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
