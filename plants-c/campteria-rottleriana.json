    "intro": "Campteria rottleriana, commonly known as the Rottler's campteria, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many toxic and ornamental species. The plant features small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, and it produces distinctive, ribbed fruit capsules. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
