It features fleshy, somewhat hairy stems and leaves that are typically rounded or ovate. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually white or pale pink, often with a distinctive hood-like structure. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its compact growth habit, it is popular as a houseplant and is relatively easy to care for."
