It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along stream banks and wet meadows. The plant features slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with rounded lobes. Its small, white flowers are arranged in racemes and bloom in early spring. The subspecies is distinguished by its finely granular texture on the underside of its leaves."
