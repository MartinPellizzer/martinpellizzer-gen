    "intro": "Calliandra ricoana, commonly known as the showy calliandra, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant is characterized by its clustered, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red, making it a popular ornamental species. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments, and it produces small, pod-like fruits. Calliandra ricoana is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility."
