    "intro": "Ctenopteris sakaguchiana, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, round structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Ctenopteris sakaguchiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
