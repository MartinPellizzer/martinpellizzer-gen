    "intro": "Crassula dentata, commonly known as the Cape snowflake, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact, rosette-shaped stems covered in tiny, tooth-like protrusions, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight. Crassula dentata is popular as a low-maintenance ornamental plant for rock gardens and indoor collections."
