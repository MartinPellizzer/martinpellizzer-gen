    "intro": "Coryphantha nuttallii, commonly known as the Nuttall's coryphantha, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless plant with a short, thick stem that often branches at the base. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne in the axils of the stems. Its leaves are ephemeral, appearing only after rainfall and soon withering, which is a common adaptation to arid environments. Coryphantha nuttallii is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it well-suited to desert ecosystems."
