    "intro": "Convolvulus stachydifolius, commonly known as the woolly morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit and features hairy, often grayish foliage. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common weed in disturbed areas. Its botanical name reflects its twisted growth pattern and the dense, woolly texture of its leaves."
