    "intro": "Carex conferta var. leptosaccus, commonly known as the narrow-sheath sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is distinguished by its narrow, acuminate leaf sheaths and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
