    "intro": "Coreopsis multiflora, commonly known as the multibract coreopsis, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern and central United States. It features erect, branching stems that produce clusters of bright yellow, daisy-like flowers with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and blooms from late spring to early summer. Its flowers are composed of a central disk surrounded by ray florets, and it is known for its ability to thrive in full sun and well-drained soil. Coreopsis multiflora is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
