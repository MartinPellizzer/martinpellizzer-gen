    "intro": "Calea cardonae var. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental candle plant, is a unique member of the Asteraceae family. It is native to arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia, where it thrives in dry, rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its striking, candle-like inflorescence composed of numerous small, tubular flowers. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to survive in harsh, desert-like conditions."
