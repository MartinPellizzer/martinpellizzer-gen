    "intro": "Clusia paralicola, commonly known as the coastal clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are usually dark green and glossy, which help it retain moisture in coastal environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its robust root system makes it highly tolerant of salt spray and sandy soils, allowing it to thrive in coastal areas. Clusia paralicola is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh maritime conditions."
