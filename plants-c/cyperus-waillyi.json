    "intro": "Cyperus waillyi, commonly known as the Wailly flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Cyperus waillyi produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
