    "intro": "Chaerophyllum palustre var. hirsutum, commonly known as hairy water parsley, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are hairy and heart-shaped, with a distinct, spicy aroma. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a umbel, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in moist environments, making it ecologically significant. It is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other wet areas where it thrives in poorly drained soil."
