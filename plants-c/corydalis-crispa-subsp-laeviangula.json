It features slender, ascending stems that bear opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowers have a distinctive spurred structure at the base, which is a characteristic feature of the Corydalis genus. The plant is often found in moist, shaded woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
