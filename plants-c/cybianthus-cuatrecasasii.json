    "intro": "Cybianthus cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Sierra Madre daisy, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow ray florets and dense, dark green foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it faces significant threats to its survival."
