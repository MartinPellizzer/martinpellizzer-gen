    "intro": "Cerocarpus aqueus, commonly known as water curl-leaf, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves that curl at the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces pink to reddish flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds when mature. Cerocarpus aqueus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian habitats."
