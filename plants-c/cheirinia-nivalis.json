    "intro": "Cheirinia nivalis, commonly known as the snowdrop, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, nodding flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and two to three white or greenish-white flowers per stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland, meadows, and alpine environments. Cheirinia nivalis is known for its resilience to cold climates and is an important early indicator of spring in its native habitats."
