    "intro": "Cardamine hederifolia, commonly known as British buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive heart-shaped base and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. The plant is often found in association with other shade-tolerant species in temperate forest ecosystems."
