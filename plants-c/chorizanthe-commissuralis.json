It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind.
