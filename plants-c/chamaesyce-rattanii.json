It is native to parts of Africa, particularly in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its small, green, succulent-like leaves that are often clustered at the base. It produces inconspicuous flowers that are typically surrounded by bracts, and it thrives in well-drained soils.
