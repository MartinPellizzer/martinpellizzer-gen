    "intro": "Calamagrostis epigejos var. brachystachya, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluejoint, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of pale blue to purple flowers in late summer. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
