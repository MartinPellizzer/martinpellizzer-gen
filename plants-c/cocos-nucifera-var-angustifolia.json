    "intro": "Cocos nucifera var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf coconut palm, is a variant of the coconut tree characterized by its slender, elongated leaves. This variety is native to tropical regions and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. It produces coconuts that are typically smaller and have a more elongated shape compared to the standard coconut. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in coastal areas for its aesthetic and functional uses. Its leaves and fruits contribute to both ecological and economic significance in tropical ecosystems."
