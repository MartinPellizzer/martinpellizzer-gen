    "intro": "Cerasus microlepis, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or yamabuki, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves and clusters of fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, tart red fruits called cherries, which are edible but not typically consumed fresh. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks. Cerasus microlepis thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight."
