It is characterized by its long, slender pseudobulbs and striking, often fragrant, flowers that come in a variety of colors including yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its flowers are borne on arching inflorescences and can last for several weeks.
