It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, adding visual interest to its landscape. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Cousinia eriobasis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in dry, challenging climates."
