    "intro": "Carex pensylvanica var. gracilifolia, commonly known as slenderleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of many sedge species. Its botanical structure supports its role in wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing soil."
