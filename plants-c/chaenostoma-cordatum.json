    "intro": "Chaenostoma cordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf waterplantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often floating or partially submerged, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, producing pale blue to purple petals. Chaenostoma cordatum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and serving as a food source for waterfowl."
