It belongs to the family Pandanaceae and is characterized by its fibrous, strap-like leaves that are often used for weaving. The plant typically grows in coastal and wetland areas, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters, while its ornamental value comes primarily from its foliage.
