It features slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground or climb. The plant produces small, red berries that are attractive to birds, contributing to its ecological value. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly toothed margin. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens."
