It is characterized by its thorny branches, ovate to elliptic leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries that are edible for birds and mammals but generally unpalatable to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian areas and woodlands."
