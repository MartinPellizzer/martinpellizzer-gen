    "intro": "Crataegus crawfordiana, commonly known as the Crawford hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Crataegus crawfordiana is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
