    "intro": "Coelogyne multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia.

The flowers are typically white or pale pink with yellow or orange markings, and they bloom in late winter to early spring.

Coelogyne multiflora is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
