    "intro": "Cyperus zollingeri var. schweinfurthianus, commonly known as the dwarf umbrella sedge, is a compact, low-growing perennial grass that thrives in moist to wet environments. It features dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, dark green leaves that form a rosette-like structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It is often used in water gardens or as a ground cover in boggy areas due to its adaptability. Its ornamental value comes from its neat appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
