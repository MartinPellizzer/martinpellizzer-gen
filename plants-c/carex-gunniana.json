It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open forested or alpine environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers. Carex gunniana is often found in subalpine and alpine zones, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
