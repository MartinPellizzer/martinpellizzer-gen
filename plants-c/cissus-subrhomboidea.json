    "intro": "Cissus subrhomboidea, commonly known as the African snowball vine, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often covered in small, white, felt-like hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that resemble snowballs, giving it its common name. These flowers are followed by small, round, green fruits that mature to a reddish color. Cissus subrhomboidea is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of conditions."
