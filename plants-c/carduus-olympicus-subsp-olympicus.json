It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and a tall, flowering stem that produces purple or pink composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and dry habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. It is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other thistle and daisy species. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
