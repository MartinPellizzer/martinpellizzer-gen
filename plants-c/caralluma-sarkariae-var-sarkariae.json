    "intro": "Caralluma sarkariae var. sarkariae, commonly known as the Kashmiri devil's backbone, is a succulent plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It features spiny, cylindrical stems that are often branched and covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the summer months, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems to survive in dry conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and arid landscapes."
