    "intro": "Clugnia volupis, commonly known as the velvetleaf orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves that range in color from deep green to rich purple. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the wet season. Clugnia volupis thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
