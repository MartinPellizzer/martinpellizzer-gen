    "intro": "Clinostigma deplanchei, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family, characterized by its twining stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces vibrant blue to purple blooms that open in the morning and close by midday, adapting to conserve moisture in hot, dry environments. Its leaves are typically small, heart-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss. Clinostigma deplanchei is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
