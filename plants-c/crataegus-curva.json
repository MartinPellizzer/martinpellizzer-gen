    "intro": "Crataegus curva, commonly known as the bent thornapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white to pinkish flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus curva typically grows in moist to wet soils in woodland areas and along streambanks. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of native plant communities and ecological restoration projects."
