It typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds, streams, and ditches, and has small, floating or submerged leaves. The plant produces tiny, white or green flowers that are often clustered together, and it is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners. Its leaves are usually oval or lance-shaped, and the plant is often found in muddy or sandy substrates. Callitriche minor is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
