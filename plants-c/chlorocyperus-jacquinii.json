    "intro": "Chlorocyperus jacquinii, commonly known as the green flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually green, with a cylindrical stem that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its inflorescence consists of small, spike-like clusters of flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. Chlorocyperus jacquinii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
