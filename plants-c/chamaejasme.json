It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to arid environments, featuring succulent leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. It typically blooms in the spring and early summer, producing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Chamaejasme is often found in sandy or gravelly soils across the southwestern United States and northern Mexico."
