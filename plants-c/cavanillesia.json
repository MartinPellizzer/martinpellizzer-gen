    "intro": "Cavanillesia, commonly known as the Mexican fan palm, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible fruits, which are consumed by various wildlife species. Cavanillesia is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its graceful appearance and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates. However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation."
