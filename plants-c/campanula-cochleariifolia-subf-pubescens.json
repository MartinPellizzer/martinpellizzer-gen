    "intro": "Campanula cochleariifolia subf. pubescens, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, pubescent stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded conditions. This subshrub is often used in rock gardens and alpine gardens due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
