It is a small, slender palm with a single trunk and feather-like leaves that are typically bright green. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into clustered fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to salt spray and sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
