    "intro": "Cereus brachypetalus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is a columnar cactus with a tall, slender stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night and emit a sweet fragrance. Its leaves are reduced to small spines, and it is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements. The flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few hours, and are pollinated by nocturnal insects."
