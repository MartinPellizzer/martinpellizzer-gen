    "intro": "Cerasus multicarpa, commonly known as the multi-fruited cherry, is a species of Prunus native to China. It is characterized by its small, edible fruits that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are ovate with a serrated margin, and it produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring. The botanical interest of Cerasus multicarpa lies in its unique ability to bear multiple fruits on a single stem, making it a subject of horticultural study."
