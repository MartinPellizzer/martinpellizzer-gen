    "intro": "Ctenitis hypolepioides, commonly known as the lace fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a complex arrangement of pinnae and pinnules. Ctenitis hypolepioides is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
