    "intro": "Cocculus polycarpus, commonly known as the devil's bit scabious, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive, spiral-shaped seed pods. The plant typically grows in dry meadows and woodland edges, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, white or pale blue flowers in summer. The fruit is a dry, twisted capsule that splits open to release its seeds."
