    "intro": "Cyathea venulosa, commonly known as the veined tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in persistent, fibrous roots and a crown of large, feathery fronds. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a deep green color and a distinctive veining pattern that gives the plant its common name. Cyathea venulosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests and along stream banks. It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and contributing to soil stability in its native habitats."
