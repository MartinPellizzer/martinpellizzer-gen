    "intro": "Cassia bifora, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. The plant has pinnate leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and its bark is often smooth with a reddish-brown color. Cassia bifora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens in warm climates."
