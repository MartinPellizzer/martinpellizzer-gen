    "intro": "Cardioteucris cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
