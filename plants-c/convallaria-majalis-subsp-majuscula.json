    "intro": "Convallaria majalis subsp. majuscula, commonly known as the giant lily of the valley, is a subspecies of the lily of the valley plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces red berries that are toxic to humans and animals, containing cardiac glycosides. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its ornamental value is limited due to its toxicity and less showy appearance compared to other lily of the valley varieties."
