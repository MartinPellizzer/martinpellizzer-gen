It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that hang downward. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a glossy green surface and a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and often forms dense colonies through its rhizomatous growth. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
