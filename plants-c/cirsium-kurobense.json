    "intro": "Cirsium kurobense, commonly known as the Japanese thistle, is a perennial plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, rough leaves and purple to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are covered in stiff hairs, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
