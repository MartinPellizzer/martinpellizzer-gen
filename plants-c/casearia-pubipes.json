    "intro": "Casearia pubipes, commonly known as the velvetleaf casearia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptic leaves that are pubescent on both surfaces, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange to red berries containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
