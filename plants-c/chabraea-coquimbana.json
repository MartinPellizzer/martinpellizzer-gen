    "intro": "Chabraea coquimbana, commonly known as the Coquimbo chabraea, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Chile. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy soils along the coast, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions. Its flowers, which range in color from yellow to orange, attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chabraea coquimbana is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
