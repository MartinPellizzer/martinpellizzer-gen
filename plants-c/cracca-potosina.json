    "intro": "Cracca potosina, commonly known as the Potosi cracca, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in regions of Bolivia and Peru. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in umbels, typical of its family. Cracca potosina is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its delicate foliage and modest flowering display. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant."
