    "intro": "Claytonia rubra subsp. depressa, commonly known as the purple marsh violet, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of showy, violet-blue flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is considered a valuable plant for wetland restoration projects."
