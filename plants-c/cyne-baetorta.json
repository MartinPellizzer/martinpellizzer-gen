It features succulent, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Cyne baetorta is known for its ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and wastelands. It contains toxic milky sap, which can cause skin irritation and is harmful if ingested."
