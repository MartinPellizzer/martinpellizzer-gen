    "intro": "Cirsium vernonioides, commonly known as the Vernon's thistle, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to the western United States and is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are usually gray-green with rough, prickly textures, and the flowers bloom in late summer to early fall. Cirsium vernonioides plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
