    "intro": "Cachrys trifida, commonly known as the three-leafed buckthorn, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
