    "intro": "Combretum hispidum, commonly known as the rough combretum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a common component of dryland vegetation in its native range."
