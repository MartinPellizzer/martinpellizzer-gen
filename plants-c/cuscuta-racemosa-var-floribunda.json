    "intro": "Cuscuta racemosa var. floribunda, commonly known as yellow dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity. The plant has slender, thread-like stems that wrap tightly around its host, forming a dense network. It is often found on crops such as corn and soybeans, making it an agricultural pest. Its rapid growth and ability to infest a wide range of hosts contribute to its invasive nature in various ecosystems."
