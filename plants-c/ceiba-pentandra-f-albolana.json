It is characterized by its massive, buttressed roots and a broad, umbrella-like canopy. The tree produces large, showy white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in a fibrous, spiny capsule that splits open when mature. The wood of this species is valued for its lightweight and durability, making it useful in construction and crafts."
