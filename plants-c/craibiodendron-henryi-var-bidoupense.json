    "intro": "Craibiodendron henryi var. bidoupense, commonly known as the Bidoup Mountain evergreen, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Vietnam. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and compact growth habit. The plant exhibits a high degree of morphological variation, with leaves that can be elliptical or ovate, often with a waxy surface. It thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, typically found in cloud forests at elevations above 1,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
