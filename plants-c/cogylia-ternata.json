    "intro": "Cogylia ternata, commonly known as the three-lobed cress, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like mustard and cabbage. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are deeply divided into three lobes, and small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along streambanks and roadsides. Cogylia ternata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
