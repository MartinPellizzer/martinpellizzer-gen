It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and lanceolate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are typically borne on long pedicels. Its milky sap, which is characteristic of the Asclepiadaceae family, is a notable botanical feature. This subspecies is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
