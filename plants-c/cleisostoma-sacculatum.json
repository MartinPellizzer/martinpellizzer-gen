It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, sac-like flowers that are often brightly colored. The plant has fleshy, strap-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot.
