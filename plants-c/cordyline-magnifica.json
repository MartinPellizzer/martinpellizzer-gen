    "intro": "Cordyline magnifica, commonly known as the red torch bamboo, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical regions of the Pacific. It features tall, slender stalks with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often a deep red or purple in color, especially when young. The plant is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is closely related to other cordylines. Its foliage makes it a popular choice for gardens and indoor spaces due to its dramatic appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
