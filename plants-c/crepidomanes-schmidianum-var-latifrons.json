    "intro": "Crepidomanes schmidianum var. latifrons, commonly known as the broad-fruited rockmoss, is a member of the Pottiaceae family, characterized by its small, rosette-forming structure. It is a cryptogamic plant, meaning it reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and is typically found in rocky or sandy habitats. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a waxy coating, aiding in water conservation. This variety is distinguished by its broader fronds compared to other varieties within the same species."
