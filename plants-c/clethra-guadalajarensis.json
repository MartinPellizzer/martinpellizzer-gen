    "intro": "Clethra guadalajarensis, commonly known as the Guadalajara clethra, is a rare shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It belongs to the plant family Clethraceae and is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for specific horticultural conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered an endangered species and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
