    "intro": "Comolia vernicosa, commonly known as the glossy buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green foliage and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring. The plant's berries are dark blue to black and are often eaten by birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
