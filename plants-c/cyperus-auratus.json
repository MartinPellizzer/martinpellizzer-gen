    "intro": "Cyperus auratus, commonly known as the golden flatsedge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and distinctive golden-brown inflorescence. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils, making it a common sight in marshy areas and along waterways. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, forming dense colonies. Cyperus auratus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
