    "intro": "Cephalomanes javanicum var. sumatranum, commonly known as the Sumatran mangrove fern, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to brackish water environments. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae and is characterized by its dense, fibrous root system that helps stabilize coastal soils. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in tidal zones. It plays a crucial role in the ecological balance of mangrove ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms. Due to habitat loss and environmental degradation, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
