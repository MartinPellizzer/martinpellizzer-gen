    "intro": "Calanthe balansae, commonly known as the Balansae Calanthe, is a rare and elegant orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces showy, lanceolate leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. Its flowers are usually pink or white, arranged in a dense spike, and are notable for their intricate, spurred petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species in botanical research and conservation efforts."
