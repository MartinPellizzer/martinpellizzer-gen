    "intro": "Campanula ketzkhovelii, commonly known as the Ketzkhovel bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to cold and arid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Campanula ketzkhovelii is considered a vulnerable species."
