    "intro": "Croton dentatus, commonly known as the toothed croton, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves with serrated edges, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by orange or red berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Croton dentatus thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Its ornamental value and medicinal properties make it a notable species in botanical gardens and herbal practices."
