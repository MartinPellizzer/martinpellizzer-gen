    "intro": "Crucifera, commonly known as the mustard family, is a group of flowering plants characterized by their four-petaled flowers arranged in a cross shape, which gives the family its name. Members of the crucifera family typically have capsules as their fruit type, which split open to release seeds. These plants are often found in a variety of habitats, including roadsides, fields, and gardens. Many crucifera species are economically important for their edible parts, such as cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower. The family also includes some invasive species that can become problematic in certain environments."
