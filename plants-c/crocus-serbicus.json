    "intro": "Crocus serbicus, commonly known as the Serbian crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters and produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland settings. The bulbs are relatively hardy and can be propagated through division or seed."
