    "intro": "Coelogyne phaiostele, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant has erect, often branched pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are usually dark green and sword-shaped, providing a lush backdrop to its showy blooms. Coelogyne phaiostele thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
