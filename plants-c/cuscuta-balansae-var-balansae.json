    "intro": "Cuscuta balansae var. balansae, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow flowers and has thread-like stems that wrap around its host to form a connection for nutrient transfer. The plant is native to parts of North America and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its life cycle involves germinating from seeds and establishing parasitic relationships quickly to ensure survival. Due to its invasive nature, it can pose a threat to agricultural crops and native vegetation."
