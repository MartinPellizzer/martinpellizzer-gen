    "intro": "Chirita calva, commonly known as the smoothleaf chinaberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It features simple, alternate leaves that are usually smooth and glossy, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by orange or red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable ornamental plant in warm climates. Due to its invasive potential in some areas, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
