    "intro": "Clematis kousabotan, commonly known as Japanese clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to East Asia. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are typically white or pale blue, with a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, round berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Clematis kousabotan is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
