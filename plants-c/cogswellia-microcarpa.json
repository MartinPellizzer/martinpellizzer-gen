    "intro": "Cogswellia microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, gray-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid environments."
