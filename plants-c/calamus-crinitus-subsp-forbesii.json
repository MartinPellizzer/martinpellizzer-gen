This subspecies is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of Indonesia and the Philippines. It thrives in wet, tropical environments, often growing in marshy or swampy areas. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by the development of dark, fibrous fruits. Its rhizomes are valued for their aromatic properties and have been used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber."
