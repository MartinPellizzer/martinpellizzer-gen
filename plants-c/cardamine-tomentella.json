    "intro": "Cardamine tomentella, commonly known as the woolly watercress, is a small perennial herb belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly pubescence. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
