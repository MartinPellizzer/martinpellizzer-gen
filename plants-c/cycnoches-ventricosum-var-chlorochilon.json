    "intro": "Cycnoches ventricosum var. chlorochilon, commonly known as the green-stemmed cycnoches, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has elongated, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to its often arid or semi-arid habitat. Its leaves are typically broad and glossy, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
