    "intro": "Cynoglossum lanuginosum, commonly known as fuzzy tongue plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features hairy, ovate leaves that are often tinged with purple, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its common name reflects the shape of its leaves, which resemble a tongue with a fuzzy texture."
