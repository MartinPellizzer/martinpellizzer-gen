    "intro": "Cunila angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf cudweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in the summer, and it produces slender, ribbed seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Cunila angustifolia is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
