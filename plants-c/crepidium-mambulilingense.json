    "intro": "Crepidium mambulilingense, commonly known as the Mambuliling orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowers. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, which are often adorned with subtle markings. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
