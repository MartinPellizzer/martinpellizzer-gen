    "intro": "Calathiana nivalis, commonly known as the snow calathia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has a low-growing habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Calathiana nivalis is considered a vulnerable species."
