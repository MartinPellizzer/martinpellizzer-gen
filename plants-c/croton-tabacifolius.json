    "intro": "Croton tabacifolius, commonly known as the tobacco leaf croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that resemble tobacco leaves, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by orange-red, fleshy berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its striking foliage. Croton tabacifolius is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
