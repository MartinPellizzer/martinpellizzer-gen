    "intro": "Cephalomanes alatum, commonly known as the winged shield fern, is a unique fern species characterized by its distinctive, wing-like fronds. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant features a creeping rhizome with dense, overlapping leaves that form a protective shield-like structure. Its fronds are typically bright green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. Cephalomanes alatum is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in shaded, moist habitats."
