    "intro": "Coelogyne papillilabia var. tenompokensis, commonly known as the Tengompen orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with a distinctive papilla-like structure on the lip, which sets it apart from other coelogyne varieties. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte on trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its foliage consists of broad, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to retain moisture. This orchid is highly sought after by botanists and orchid enthusiasts due to its rarity and ornamental value."
