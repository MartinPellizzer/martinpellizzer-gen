    "intro": "Carex panicea var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf panicled sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flower heads that are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is distinguished by its compact size and reduced fruiting structures compared to the typical form of Carex panicea."
