    "intro": "Coleosanthus brachiatus, commonly known as the branched sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its robust, woody stems and large, showy flowers that typically range in color from yellow to red. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often growing in shallow tidal zones. Its leaves are broad and palmately lobed, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Coleosanthus brachiatus plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
