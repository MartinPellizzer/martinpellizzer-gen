    "intro": "Corchorus serratus, commonly known as the prickly sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in a spiky, burs-like structure, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. Corchorus serratus is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
