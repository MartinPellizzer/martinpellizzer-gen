    "intro": "Copiapoa megarhiza var. echinata, commonly known as the spiny copiapoa, is a cacti species native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its spiny areoles are covered with short, stiff hairs, providing protection from herbivores. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated in succulent gardens."
