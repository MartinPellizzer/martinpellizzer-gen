It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, showcasing its adaptability to moist environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands in wetlands. Cyperus schraderi is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
