    "intro": "Clarkia pulchella var. nana, commonly known as dwarf Clarkia, is a low-growing annual plant native to the western United States. It features showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a distinctive black or purple spot at the base of each petal. The plant typically blooms from late spring to early summer and thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Its compact form and vibrant flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and wildflower displays. The variety 'nana' is characterized by its shorter stature compared to the typical form of Clarkia pulchella."
