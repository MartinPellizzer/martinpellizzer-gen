    "intro": "Copernicia brittonorum, commonly known as the Britton's copernicia, is a species of palm native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and pinnate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clustered inflorescences, which are typically borne near the base of the leaves. Its fruits are small, round drupes that mature to a reddish color, containing a single seed. This palm is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, often found in dry, tropical environments."
