    "intro": "Candollina haenkeana, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its elegant, spurred flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, adapted to capture limited sunlight in its natural setting. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Candollina haenkeana is considered a conservation concern."
