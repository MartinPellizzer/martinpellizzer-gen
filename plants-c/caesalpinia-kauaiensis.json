It is a small shrub or tree that typically grows to a height of about 3 to 5 meters. The plant is characterized by its bright red to orange flowers, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. Caesalpinia kauaiensis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry forests."
