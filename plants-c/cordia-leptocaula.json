    "intro": "Cordia leptocaula, commonly known as the slender-stemmed cordia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, cylindrical stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, fleshy, orange-red fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory properties. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
