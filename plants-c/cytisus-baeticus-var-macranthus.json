    "intro": "Cytisus baeticus var. macranthus, commonly known as the Almer\u00eda broom, is a shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for Mediterranean climates. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. This variety is notable for its larger flowers compared to other cytisus species, which contribute to its ornamental value."
