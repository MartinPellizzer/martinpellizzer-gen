    "intro": "Centaurea arenaria subsp. majorovii, commonly known as the sand centaury, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
