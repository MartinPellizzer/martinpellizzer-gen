    "intro": "Corema, commonly known as the \"southern cross\" or \"Australian cross,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Theaceae. It consists of two species, Corema conjugatum and Corema calycinum, both native to Australia. These plants are shrubs characterized by their distinctive, four-petaled white or yellow flowers that resemble a cross. The leaves are typically narrow and leathery, and the plants are often found in coastal or sandy soils. Corema species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their unique floral display."
