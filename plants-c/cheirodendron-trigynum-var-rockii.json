    "intro": "Cheirodendron trigynum var. rockii, commonly known as the Rock Island hibiscus, is a shrub native to the southern United States, particularly found in coastal areas of Texas and Florida. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, dark seeds. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is often found in dune ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in coastal plant communities."
