    "intro": "Cieca misera, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a melancholic appearance. The leaves are typically broad and oval, with a smooth texture and a bright green color in summer. It thrives in moist environments, such as riverbanks and wetlands, and is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by woody capsules that release seeds."
