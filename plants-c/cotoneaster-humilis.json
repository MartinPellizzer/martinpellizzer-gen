    "intro": "Cotoneaster humilis, commonly known as the low cotoneaster, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, compact growth with small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of white to pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Cotoneaster humilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness."
