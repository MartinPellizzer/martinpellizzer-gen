    "intro": "Ctenitis acuta, commonly known as the acute ctenitis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Ctenitis acuta plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various microorganisms and small fauna."
