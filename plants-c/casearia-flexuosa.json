    "intro": "Casearia flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible casearia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Salicaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and often have a serrated margin. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in terminal inflorescences, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible. Casearia flexuosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
