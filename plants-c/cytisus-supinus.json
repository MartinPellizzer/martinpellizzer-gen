    "intro": "Cytisus supinus, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, woody stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. Cytisus supinus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas."
