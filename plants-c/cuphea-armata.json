    "intro": "Cuphea armata, commonly known as the sticky cupweed, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Lythraceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to purple. The plant produces small, sticky seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Cuphea armata is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
