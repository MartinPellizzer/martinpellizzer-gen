    "intro": "Cyrtomium pusillum, commonly known as the small shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, shield-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky slopes. Its rhizome is short and thick, supporting the growth of its delicate, bipinnate leaves. Cyrtomium pusillum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
