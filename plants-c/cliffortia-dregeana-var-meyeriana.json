It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky and sandy soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions. It has slender, wiry stems and small, trifoliate leaves, which help it conserve water in its arid habitat.
