It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant is native to Central and South America and thrives in warm, humid climates. It has a short growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a few months, making it a common weed in agricultural fields. Its botanical features make it both a useful plant for soil nitrogen fixation and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
