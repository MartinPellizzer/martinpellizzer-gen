    "intro": "Cuscuta pacifica, commonly known as the giant dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle involving seed germination, attachment to a host, and eventual maturation. The plant's stems are covered in tiny, hair-like structures that help it adhere to its host. It is native to North America and can be found growing on a variety of plants, including shrubs and trees. Its parasitic nature makes it a significant concern for agricultural crops."
