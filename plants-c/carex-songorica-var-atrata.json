It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear dark purple to black berries, which are a distinguishing feature of this variety. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and wetland restoration projects."
