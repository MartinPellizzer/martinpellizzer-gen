    "intro": "Casuarina paludosa var. robusta, commonly known as the swamp she-oak, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal and wetland areas of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical foliage and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in saline or waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain edible seeds, which are an important food source for various bird species. It thrives in brackish or fresh water environments and is often found in mangrove swamps or along estuaries. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
