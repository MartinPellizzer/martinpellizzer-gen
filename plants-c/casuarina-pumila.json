    "intro": "Casuarina pumila, commonly known as the slender she-oak, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like foliage that resembles the appearance of a pine tree. The plant produces small, round cones that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often forming dense thickets in coastal dunes. Casuarina pumila is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
