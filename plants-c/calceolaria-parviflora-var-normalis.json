    "intro": "Calceolaria parviflora var. normalis, commonly known as the small-flowered slipper orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Andean regions of South America. It features delicate, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that resemble tiny slippers, with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows to a height of about 15-30 cm, producing clusters of bright orange or yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, hairy textures, which help it retain moisture in its native habitat. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
