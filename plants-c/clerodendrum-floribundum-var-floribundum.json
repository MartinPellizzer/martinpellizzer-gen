    "intro": "Clerodendrum floribundum var. floribundum, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a flowering shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, papery bracts that resemble small lanterns, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, emerging from the base of the bracts. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
