    "intro": "Calycogonium turbinatum, commonly known as the turban snail, is a species of air-breathing land snail belonging to the family Achatinellidae. It is characterized by its large, spiral-shaped shell that is typically tan to brown in color with a smooth, glossy surface. The shell is elongated and conical, with a distinct whorl separation and a thick, robust lip. The snail is native to the Hawaiian Islands and is found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
