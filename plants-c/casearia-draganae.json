    "intro": "Casearia draganae, commonly known as the Dragon's Blood Tree, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Salicaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like canopy of small, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into woody, egg-shaped fruits. Its most notable feature is the reddish-brown resin it exudes, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a dye. The tree thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests."
