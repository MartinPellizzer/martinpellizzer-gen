    "intro": "Corion radicans proles capillaceum, commonly known as the hairroot fern, is a unique species characterized by its delicate, hair-like rhizomes that spread along the soil surface. The plant produces small, clustered fronds with a feathery appearance, typically ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters in length. Its leaves are usually bright green and have a soft, leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate forests or along stream banks. Botanically, it is notable for its specialized root system that aids in nutrient absorption and stabilization in loose, sandy soils."
