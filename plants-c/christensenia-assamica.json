    "intro": "Christensenia assamica, commonly known as the Assam cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the northeastern regions of India. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones for reproduction. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in dense forests with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
