    "intro": "Calophyllum inophyllum, commonly known as the white mangosteen, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that are often clustered in panicles, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. The fruit contains a single seed enclosed in a white, spongy aril, which is the edible part consumed by humans. It is also valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects."
