    "intro": "Carex digama, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomes help it spread vegetatively. Carex digama plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
