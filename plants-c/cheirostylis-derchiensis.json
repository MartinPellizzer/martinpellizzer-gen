    "intro": "Cheirostylis derchiensis, commonly known as the Dali orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
