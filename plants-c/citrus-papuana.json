    "intro": "Citrus papuana, commonly known as the Papuan lime, is a small evergreen tree native to the island of New Guinea. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by round, green fruits that are similar in appearance to limes. The fruit is valued for its high vitamin C content and is used in local cuisines and traditional medicine. Its cultivation is limited due to its specific habitat requirements and susceptibility to certain pests and diseases."
