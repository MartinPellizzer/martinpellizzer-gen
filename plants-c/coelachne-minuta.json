    "intro": "Coelachne minuta, commonly known as the minute coelachne, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tiny, narrow leaves and clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and along roadsides. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with three stamens and a single pistil, typical of the Poaceae family. Coelachne minuta is often overlooked due to its diminutive size, but it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for small invertebrates."
