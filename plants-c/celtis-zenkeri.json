    "intro": "Celtis zenkeri, commonly known as the African hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate to elliptic in shape, with a pointed tip and serrated edges. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, round berries that are edible for some animals but generally not for humans. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in local construction and furniture-making."
