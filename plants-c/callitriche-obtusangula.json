It has slender, branching stems that often lie close to the water surface. The plant features rounded, broad leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. Its tiny, greenish-white flowers are borne in clusters and bloom during the summer months. Callitriche obtusangula plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish."
