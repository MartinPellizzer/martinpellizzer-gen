It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and produces a resinous sap that has been historically used in traditional medicine and incense. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, with multiple stems forming a dense shrub. The resin exuded from its bark and leaves has a distinct aromatic quality and has been utilized for centuries in various cultural and medicinal practices."
