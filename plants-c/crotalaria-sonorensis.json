It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant features compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets and produces yellow or orange flowers arranged in racemes. Its seed pods are elongated and contain several angular, oblong seeds. Crotalaria sonorensis has a distinctive appearance and is often mistaken for other members of the Fabaceae family due to its similar floral structure."
