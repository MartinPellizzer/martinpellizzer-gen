    "intro": "Chenopodium album var. integerrimum, commonly known as lambsquarters, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate to triangular leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by dry, triangular seeds that are easily dispersed by wind. Lambsquarters is commonly found in disturbed soils, such as fields, roadsides, and gardens, and is often considered a weed. It is valued in some regions for its edible leaves, which are rich in nutrients like vitamins A and C."
