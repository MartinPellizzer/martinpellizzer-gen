    "intro": "Caucalis littoralis, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, where it thrives in salty and windy conditions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pale blue or white, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Caucalis littoralis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms."
