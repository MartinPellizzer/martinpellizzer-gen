    "intro": "Chenopodium murale var. microphyllum, commonly known as tumbleweed, is a flowering plant in the Amaranthaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or yellowish in color. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America and is well adapted to dry, disturbed soils. Tumbleweed is known for its ability to detach from its root system and roll across the ground, dispersing its seeds over long distances."
