    "intro": "Clethra tomentella, commonly known as the woolly clethra, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in cylindrical racemes. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Clethra tomentella is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for pollinators and habitat for wildlife."
