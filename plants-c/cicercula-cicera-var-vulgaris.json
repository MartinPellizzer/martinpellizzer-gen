It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and slender, twisting stems that often grow along the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by lens-shaped pods containing several seeds. It is typically found in disturbed soils and is often used as a cover crop or forage. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it beneficial for soil fertility."
