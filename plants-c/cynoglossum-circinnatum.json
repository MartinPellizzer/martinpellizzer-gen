It features striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has distinctive, curling leaves that give it its common name, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. It is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats and is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal. Cynoglossum circinnatum is also known for its medicinal properties, though it is not widely cultivated for commercial use."
