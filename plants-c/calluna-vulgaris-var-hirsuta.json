    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy heather, is a variant of the common heather native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late summer to early autumn. Its hairy foliage gives it a distinctive appearance, and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in rocky or barren areas. This variety is also valued for its role in supporting local wildlife, particularly insects and birds."
