It features alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically hairy and have a distinct, often glandular surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, usually in shades of purple or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, dry seeds. Calyptrosciadium polycladum is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils."
