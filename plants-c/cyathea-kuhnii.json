    "intro": "Cyathea kuhnii, commonly known as the Kuhn's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Cyathea kuhnii typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizome system supports the growth of the trunk and facilitates the absorption of nutrients from the soil."
