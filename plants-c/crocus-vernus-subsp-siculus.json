    "intro": "Crocus vernus subsp. siculus, commonly known as the Sicilian crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and the Mediterranean region. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in woodland areas and shaded gardens. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in well-drained soil. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different flower structure and geographic distribution compared to the typical C. vernus."
