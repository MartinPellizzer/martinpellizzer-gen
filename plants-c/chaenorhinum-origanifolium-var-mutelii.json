    "intro": "Chaenorhinum origanifolium var. mutelii, commonly known as the Mutel's oregano-leaved horned poppy, is a rare and striking botanical species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its vibrant orange-red flowers, which are surrounded by distinctive, horn-like bracts. The plant features narrow, aromatic leaves reminiscent of oregano, contributing to its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, typically found in rocky or limestone habitats. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by specialty growers."
