    "intro": "Cenchrus americanus subsp. stenostachyus, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a grass species native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and dunes. Sand dropseed is adapted to dry conditions and is considered a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
