    "intro": "Cynometra fischeri, commonly known as the Fischer's ironwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is often found in dry forest and woodland habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its slow growth and durable timber, it is valued for both ecological and economic purposes."
