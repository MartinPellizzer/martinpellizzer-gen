    "intro": "Cereus tetragonus var. minor, commonly known as the miniature star cactus, is a succulent plant native to South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces striking, nocturnal flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, opening only during the evening. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is a popular choice for indoor and outdoor succulent collections."
