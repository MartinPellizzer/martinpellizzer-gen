    "intro": "Cayratia cardiophylla, commonly known as the heart-leaf vine, is a climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rapid growth makes it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
