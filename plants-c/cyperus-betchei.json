    "intro": "Cyperus betchei, commonly known as the Betche's flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly found in swampy and wetland habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower spikes that are often inconspicuous. It thrives in moist to saturated soils and is often found in marshes, along riverbanks, and in seasonally flooded areas. Cyperus betchei is typically used in ornamental gardening due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions."
