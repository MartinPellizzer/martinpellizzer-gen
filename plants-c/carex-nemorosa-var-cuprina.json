    "intro": "Carex nemorosa var. cuprina, commonly known as the cup-shaped wood sedge, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture. The variety 'cuprina' is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and the presence of a cup-like structure at the base of the plant."
