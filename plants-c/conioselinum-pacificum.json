    "intro": "Conioselinum pacificum, commonly known as the Pacific cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic when crushed, often releasing a subtle, fresh scent. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found growing in open coastal areas and along riverbanks. Conioselinum pacificum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is considered an important component of coastal ecosystems."
