    "intro": "Cerasus caproniana var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated cherry, is a striking ornamental plant characterized by its distinctive leaf patterns. It belongs to the Prunus genus and is native to certain regions of Asia, particularly China. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by edible berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Its variegated foliage, with white and green stripes, makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. However, it is relatively rare in cultivation and requires specific care to thrive."
