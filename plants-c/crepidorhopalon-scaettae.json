    "intro": "Crepidorhopalon scaettae, commonly known as the Scaetta's rock cress, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
