    "intro": "Cladium rubiginosum, commonly known as the red-stained sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow water or saturated soil, often found in marshes and swamps. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often reddish in color, especially when young, which gives it its common name. Its flowering spikes are usually slender and produce small, inconspicuous flowers. Cladium rubiginosum plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing soil."
