    "intro": "Crataegus flava var. integra, commonly known as the yellow hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red-orange berries in the fall. The plant has small, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces thorned stems, typical of the Crataegus genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and open woodlands. Its ornamental value is due to its vibrant seasonal color changes and showy flowers."
