    "intro": "Cyperus spiralis, commonly known as the spiral sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and distinctive spiral arrangement of its flowering spikes. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as swamps and pond edges. Its inflorescence consists of a single, elongated spike that curves in a helical pattern, giving it its common name. Cyperus spiralis is often used in ornamental gardening due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in moist conditions."
