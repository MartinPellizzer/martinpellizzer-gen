    "intro": "Claoxylon indicum var. neocaledonicum, commonly known as the New Caledonia claoxylon, is a tropical tree native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
