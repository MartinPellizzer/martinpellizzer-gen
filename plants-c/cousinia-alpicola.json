    "intro": "Cousinia alpicola, commonly known as the alpine cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes where conditions are harsh. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in cold, arid climates. Cousinia alpicola produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, contributing to the biodiversity of its mountainous habitat."
