    "intro": "Cotoneaster nummularius var. lindleyi, commonly known as the silver cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically silver-white in color. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and compact size. This variety is relatively low maintenance and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
