    "intro": "Caragana pygmaea lusus angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf burr poppy, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of central Asia. It features small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces delicate yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its woody stems are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, providing protection against extreme temperatures. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry, rocky soils."
