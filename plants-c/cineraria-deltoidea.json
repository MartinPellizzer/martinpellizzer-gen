It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring, adding vibrant color to its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Cineraria deltoidea is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries."
