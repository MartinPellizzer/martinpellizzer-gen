    "intro": "Cassia ensiformis var. plurifoliolata, commonly known as the many-leaved cassia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often deeply lobed and can have multiple leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces yellow, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, followed by long, slender pods containing flat, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some cultures."
