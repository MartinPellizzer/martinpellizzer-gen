    "intro": "Cephalaria squamiflora subsp. bigazzii, commonly known as the Alpine cephalaria, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the European Alps. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in alpine gardens."
