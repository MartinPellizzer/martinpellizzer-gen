    "intro": "Cnemidaria chiricana var. contigua, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water clover, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, consisting of four petals and five stamens. This variety is valued for its role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
