    "intro": "Cephalocereus backebergii, commonly known as the Easter cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, segmented stems that often bear spines and are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light. Due to its slow growth and striking appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
