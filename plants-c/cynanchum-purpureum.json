    "intro": "Cynanchum purpureum, commonly known as purple milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, purple to pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in racemes. Its fruit is a legume pod that contains several seeds, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. Cynanchum purpureum is adapted to drought conditions and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
