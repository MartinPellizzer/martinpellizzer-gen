It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered with a dense, fibrous layer of old leaf bases. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a dark green, leathery texture and a serrated margin. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
