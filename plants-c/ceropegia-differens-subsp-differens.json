    "intro": "Ceropegia differens subsp. differens, commonly known as the African violet or the string of hearts, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a velvety texture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
