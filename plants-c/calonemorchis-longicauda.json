    "intro": "Calonemorchis longicauda, commonly known as the long-tailed calonemorchis, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated inflorescence and striking, often colorful flowers that are adapted for specific pollinators. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous or forested areas with well-drained soil. Its morphology reflects evolutionary adaptations to its ecological niche, with features such as long, slender stems and specialized floral structures. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
