    "intro": "Cestrum toxicarium, commonly known as the toxic nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other toxic plants like tomatoes and belladonna. The plant is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its berries are bright red and highly toxic, containing alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals. Due to its toxicity, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant but requires careful handling."
