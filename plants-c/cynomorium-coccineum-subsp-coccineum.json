    "intro": "Cynomorium coccineum subsp. coccineum, commonly known as the red hemiparasite, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sun-exposed areas. Its unique ecological role and striking appearance make it a notable species in its native habitat."
