    "intro": "Cymbidium flabelliforme, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a perennial herb with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces long, arching inflorescences bearing numerous fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. Its leaves are broad, fleshy, and arranged in a fan-like pattern, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
