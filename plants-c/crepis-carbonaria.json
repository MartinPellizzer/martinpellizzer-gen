    "intro": "Crepis carbonaria, commonly known as the black bentgrass, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that appear in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, calcareous soils. The plant is often found in wet meadows, streambanks, and other damp habitats. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable environments."
