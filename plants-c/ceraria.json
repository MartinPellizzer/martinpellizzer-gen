It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. These plants are typically found in coastal areas, thriving in sandy or saline soils. Ceraria species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh maritime conditions. They play a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in coastal ecosystems."
