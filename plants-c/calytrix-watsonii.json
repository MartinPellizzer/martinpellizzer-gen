It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flowers that are typically red or pink in color, which are clustered in dense, brush-like inflorescences. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Calytrix watsonii is also valued for its ability to attract native pollinators such as birds and bees."
