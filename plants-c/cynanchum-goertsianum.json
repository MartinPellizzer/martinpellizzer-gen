    "intro": "Cynanchum goertsianum, commonly known as the Goertzen's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its slender stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by follicles that contain seeds with silky hairs. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in steppes and rocky soils. Cynanchum goertsianum is known for its latex-like sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
