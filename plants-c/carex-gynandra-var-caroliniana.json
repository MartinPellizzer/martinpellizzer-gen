    "intro": "Carex gynandra var. caroliniana, commonly known as swamp arrowhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and pond edges. Its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
