    "intro": "Crataegus ambigens, commonly known as the ambiguous hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3\u201310 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early spring. The plant produces red or orange berries that are edible for birds and small mammals but are generally not consumed by humans. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodlands, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges, and turn yellow or red in the fall."
