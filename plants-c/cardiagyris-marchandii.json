    "intro": "Cardiagyris marchandii, commonly known as the Marchand's heartleaf, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
