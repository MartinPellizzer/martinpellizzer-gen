    "intro": "Centaurea triumfettii subsp. adscendens, commonly known as the ascending centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and bright blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, spiny bracts beneath the flowers, which are a distinctive botanical feature. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance."
