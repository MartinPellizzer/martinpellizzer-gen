    "intro": "Cinchona australis, commonly known as the Chilean quinine tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to southern South America, particularly Chile and Argentina, and thrives in temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries containing seeds. Cinchona australis is valued for its historical use in the production of quinine, though it is now primarily cultivated for ornamental purposes."
