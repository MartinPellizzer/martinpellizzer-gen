    "intro": "Chenopodium spathulatum, commonly known as broadleaf goosefoot, is a herbaceous annual plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, and its seeds are typically dispersed by wind. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to thrive in a variety of soil types. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but also has historical uses in traditional medicine."
