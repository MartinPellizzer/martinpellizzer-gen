It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fragrant flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments at high altitudes. Its leaves are elliptical and arranged in a rosette, while the inflorescence bears a single, showy flower. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
