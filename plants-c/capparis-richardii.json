    "intro": "Capparis richardii, commonly known as the rock caper, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky, coastal areas and is well adapted to arid and saline environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in umbels, and it has a distinctive, somewhat pungent odor. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, which helps it conserve water in its harsh habitat. The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is known for its resilience in challenging conditions."
