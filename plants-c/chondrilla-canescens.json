    "intro": "Chondrilla canescens, commonly known as desert milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and hairy, gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Chondrilla canescens is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to survive in extreme temperature fluctuations."
