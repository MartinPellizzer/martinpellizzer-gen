    "intro": "Celsia rupestris, commonly known as the rock celsia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and white, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
