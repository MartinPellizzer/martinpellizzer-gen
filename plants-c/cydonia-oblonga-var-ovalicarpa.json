    "intro": "Cydonia oblonga var. ovalicarpa, commonly known as the oval-shaped persimmon, is a cultivar of the persimmon tree native to China. It is characterized by its large, elongated, orange to reddish-orange fruits that are typically harvested when fully ripe. The plant produces showy, yellowish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by the development of its distinctive fruit. The leaves are broad, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin. This variety is valued for its sweet, non-astringent fruit, which is often used in both fresh consumption and culinary applications."
