    "intro": "Conostylis aculeata var. abbreviata, commonly known as the dwarf tussock grass, is a perennial herb native to southeastern Australia. It features tufted, wiry stems with dense, fibrous leaves that are typically shorter than those of the standard species. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in summer, arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. This variety is noted for its compact growth habit and is sometimes used in native gardens for its ornamental value."
