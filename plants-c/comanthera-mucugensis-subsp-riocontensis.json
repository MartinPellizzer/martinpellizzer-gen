    "intro": "Comanthera mucugensis subsp. riocontensis, commonly known as the Rio Cont\u00e9 cactus, is a species native to the Andean region of South America. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring a cylindrical stem covered in small, fleshy tubercles. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the dry season, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
