    "intro": "Cornus sanguinea var. viridissima, commonly known as the green-stemmed dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, greenish stems that remain visible throughout the winter, providing winter interest in gardens. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in autumn. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a versatile addition to woodland gardens."
