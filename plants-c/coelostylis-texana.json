It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, which includes many diverse and often showy orchids. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered in spikes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in prairies or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
