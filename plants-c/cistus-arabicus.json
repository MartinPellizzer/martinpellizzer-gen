    "intro": "Cistus arabicus, commonly known as the Arabian rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern regions. It is characterized by its woody stems and aromatic, glandular leaves that release a strong, resinous scent. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Cistus arabicus is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
