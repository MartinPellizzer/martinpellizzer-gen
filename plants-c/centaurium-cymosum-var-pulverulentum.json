    "intro": "Centaurium cymosum var. pulverulentum, commonly known as the dusty mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, bright green, ovate leaves covered in a fine, powdery coating that gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, red-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
