    "intro": "Connarus gabonensis, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and West Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has a straight trunk and broad, compound leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
