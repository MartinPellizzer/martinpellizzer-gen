    "intro": "Cylindropuntia \u00d7 antoniae, commonly known as the \"Antonia's hedgehog cactus,\" is a hybrid species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are often segmented and covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
