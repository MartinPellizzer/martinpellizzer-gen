    "intro": "Cytisus purpureus var. erectus, commonly known as the purple broom, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves and produces long, cylindrical pods that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and dry garden environments. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in non-native habitats."
