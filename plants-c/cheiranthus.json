    "intro": "Cheiranthus, commonly known as wallflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers that bloom in spring or early summer. They typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce small, pod-like fruits called siliques. Cheiranthus species are often found in rocky or disturbed soils, and many are cultivated for their ornamental value. The genus includes around 40 species, with varying degrees of hardiness and blooming habits."
