It is a tall, herbaceous plant that can grow up to several meters in height, characterized by its long, narrow leaves. The plant produces a spadix, which is a type of inflorescence typical of the Aroid family, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Calamus nicobaricus is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including the Nicobar Islands. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands."
