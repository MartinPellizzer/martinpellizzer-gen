    "intro": "Caltha scaposa var. smithii, commonly known as the Smith's Crowfoot, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, nodding yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as stream banks and forest floors. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive trifoliate or five-leaf pattern. The variety 'smithii' is distinguished by its slightly larger flowers and more robust growth compared to the typical form of Caltha scaposa."
