    "intro": "Curraniodendron, commonly known as the Andean mountain ash, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. The plants are shrubs or small trees characterized by their evergreen leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. They typically grow in rocky or mountainous terrain, where they are adapted to cold and nutrient-poor soils. Curraniodendron species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in their native habitats."
