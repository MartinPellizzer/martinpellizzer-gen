    "intro": "Cardopatium corymbosum, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with purple at the base. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens despite its limited distribution in the wild."
