    "intro": "Croton echioideus, commonly known as the red croton, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its striking, colorful leaves that range from bright red to orange and yellow, often with contrasting veins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is not recommended for indoor use without proper precautions."
