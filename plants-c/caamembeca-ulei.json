    "intro": "Caamembeca ulei, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are not particularly showy but are followed by distinctive, elongated seed pods. Caamembeca ulei is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
