    "intro": "Corchorus sericeus, commonly known as silky dock, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its smooth, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by spiny, triangular seed pods. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Silky dock is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
