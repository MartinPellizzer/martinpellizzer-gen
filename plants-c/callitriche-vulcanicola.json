    "intro": "Callitriche vulcanicola, commonly known as the volcanic water-star, is a rare aquatic plant native to volcanic regions. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments with high mineral content, often found near geothermal springs. The plant has small, floating leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter. It produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered an indicator species for volcanic soil and thermal activity."
