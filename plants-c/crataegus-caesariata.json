    "intro": "Crataegus caesariata, commonly known as the green hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. The green hawthorn is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine."
