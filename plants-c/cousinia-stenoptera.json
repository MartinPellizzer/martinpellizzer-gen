    "intro": "Cousinia stenoptera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Cousinia stenoptera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens."
