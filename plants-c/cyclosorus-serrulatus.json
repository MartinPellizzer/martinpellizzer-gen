    "intro": "Cyclosorus serrulatus, commonly known as the serrated cyclosorus, is a species of aquatic fern native to freshwater environments in Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving streams and ponds, where it attaches to submerged surfaces with its rhizomes. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with serrated margins, giving it its common name. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Cyclosorus serrulatus plays a role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
