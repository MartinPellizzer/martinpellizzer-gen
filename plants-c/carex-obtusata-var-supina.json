It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered flower spikes. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, wetlands, and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and colonize new areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
