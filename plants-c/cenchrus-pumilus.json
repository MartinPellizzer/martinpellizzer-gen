    "intro": "Cenchrus pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf panicgrass, is a small annual grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small spikelets. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in coastal areas, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a common weed in many regions."
