    "intro": "Cupressus mairei, commonly known as the Maire cypress, is a species of coniferous evergreen tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender form and its distinctive, scale-like leaves that are arranged in dense, flat sprays. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of the Cupressaceae family. Its bark is reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age, adding to its ornamental appeal. This plant is well adapted to coastal environments and is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and aesthetic value."
