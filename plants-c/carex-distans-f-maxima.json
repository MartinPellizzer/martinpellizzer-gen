    "intro": "Carex distans f. maxima, commonly known as the giant sedge, is a tall, perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This variant is notable for its larger size compared to the typical form of Carex distans."
