    "intro": "Clerodendrum medium, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a flowering shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant orange-red bracts that resemble small lanterns, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Clerodendrum medium is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
