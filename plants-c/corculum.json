    "intro": "Corculum, commonly known as the sea hare, is a type of sea slug belonging to the family Aplysiidae. It is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body and the presence of a radula, a specialized feeding structure. The plant-like appearance of Corculum is due to its ability to secrete a mucus-like substance, which can resemble plant cells. It thrives in marine environments and is often found in shallow coastal waters. While not a true plant, Corculum plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to nutrient cycling."
