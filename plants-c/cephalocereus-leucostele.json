    "intro": "Cephalocereus leucostele, commonly known as the white-stemmed hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically covered in white or pale-colored spines. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted for water storage, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. The plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
