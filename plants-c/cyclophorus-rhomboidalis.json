    "intro": "Cyclophorus rhomboidalis, commonly known as the diamond-shaped liverwort, is a small, leafy liverwort belonging to the family Pinnulaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive rhomboid-shaped thallus, which is often covered in a layer of fine, translucent cells. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as gametangia, are located on the upper surface of the thallus. Cyclophorus rhomboidalis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates."
