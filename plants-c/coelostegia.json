    "intro": "Coelostegia, commonly known as the \"spider plant\" or \"air plant,\" is a type of epiphytic plant that thrives in humid environments. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its ability to grow on other plants without harming them. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green in color. Its leaves are long, strap-like, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Coelostegia is popular as a decorative plant due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal."
