    "intro": "Canthium scandens, commonly known as the climbing spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows as a vine, using its tendrils to climb and support itself on other vegetation. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in cyathia, which are cup-shaped structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Canthium scandens is often found in moist, shaded habitats and can be invasive in certain regions."
