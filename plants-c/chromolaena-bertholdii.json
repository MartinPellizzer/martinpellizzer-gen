    "intro": "Chromolaena bertholdii, commonly known as the flame bush, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, often thorny growth and bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Chromolaena bertholdii is also sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its aggressive spreading habit."
