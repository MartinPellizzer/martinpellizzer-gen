    "intro": "Craterostigma nanum, commonly known as the dwarf bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still water bodies such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are simple and often submerged, while its stems are wiry and branching. Craterostigma nanum is known for its ability to tolerate low light conditions and is sometimes cultivated in aquariums."
