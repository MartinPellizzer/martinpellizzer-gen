    "intro": "Combretum erianthum, commonly known as the velvetwood or African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically valued for timber and traditional uses."
