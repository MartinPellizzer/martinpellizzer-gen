    "intro": "Carex perakensis var. perakensis, commonly known as the Perak sedge, is a species of sedge native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, preferring moist, well-drained soil. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
