    "intro": "Cereus ramosus, commonly known as the branched cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems that are typically covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, often in shades of yellow or orange. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cereus ramosus is a popular choice for desert gardens due to its hardy nature and striking appearance."
