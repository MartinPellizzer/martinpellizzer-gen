    "intro": "Cylindropuntia alcahes, commonly known as the Arizona hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial cactus that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features cylindrical stems that are covered in spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, blooming in the spring or early summer. The cactus is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in supporting local wildlife by providing nectar to pollinators."
