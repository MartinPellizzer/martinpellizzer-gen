    "intro": "Chimaphila rhombifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf pipsissewa, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense foliage. The plant features opposite, rhombic-shaped leaves that are typically glossy green and remain on the plant throughout the year. It produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. Chimaphila rhombifolia thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
