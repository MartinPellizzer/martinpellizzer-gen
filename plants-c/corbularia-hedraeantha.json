    "intro": "Corbularia hedraeantha, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its unique floral structure and ecological role make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
