    "intro": "Clematis virginiana var. cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically 2 to 4 inches in diameter, with a rough, hairy texture on the underside. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer, usually in shades of white, blue, or purple. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental vines. Its vigorous growth habit requires support structures like trellises or fences for optimal display."
