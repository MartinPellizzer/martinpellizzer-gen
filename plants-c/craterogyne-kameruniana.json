    "intro": "Craterogyne kameruniana, commonly known as the Cameroon Crater Orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the Cameroon region of Central Africa. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers and is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest in botanical research."
