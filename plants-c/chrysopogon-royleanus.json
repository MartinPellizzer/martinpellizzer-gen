    "intro": "Chrysopogon royleanus, commonly known as the blue grass or blue oat grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Himalayas and parts of South Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used for soil stabilization."
