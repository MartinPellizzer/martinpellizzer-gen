It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, blue, and purple. The plants typically have hairy stems and leaves, and some species possess thorns, giving them their common name. Chaetanthus species are native to regions in Europe, Asia, and North America, often growing in woodland or meadow habitats. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
