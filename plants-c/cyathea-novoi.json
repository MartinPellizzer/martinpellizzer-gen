    "intro": "Cyathea novoi, commonly known as the New Guinea tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a robust rhizome that supports its growth and helps in nutrient absorption from the soil. Cyathea novoi thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its slow growth rate and longevity make it a significant component of the forest ecosystem."
