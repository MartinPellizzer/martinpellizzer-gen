    "intro": "Coprosma foliosa, commonly known as the silver coprosma, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a silvery-gray color, covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions. Coprosma foliosa is often used in native landscaping due to its ornamental value and ability to support local wildlife."
