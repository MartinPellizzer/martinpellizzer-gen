    "intro": "Clidemia myrmecina, commonly known as the creeping waxplant, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant is often found growing in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and stream banks. It has a sprawling growth habit and produces berries that are dispersed by birds. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
