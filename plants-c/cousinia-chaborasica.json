    "intro": "Cousinia chaborasica, commonly known as the Chaborasica globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically silver-gray, covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Cousinia chaborasica is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, dry climates."
