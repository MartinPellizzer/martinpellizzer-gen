    "intro": "Cynosurus aureus, commonly known as golden hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves that are often tinged with a golden hue, especially at the base. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike that bears small, spikelet-like flowers. Cynosurus aureus plays an important role in maintaining ecological balance by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small mammals."
