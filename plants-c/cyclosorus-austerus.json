    "intro": "Cyclosorus austerus, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a creeping rhizome with simple, linear leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves and are covered by a protective indusium. Cyclosorus austerus is known for its ability to thrive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient member of its ecosystem."
