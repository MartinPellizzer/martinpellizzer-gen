    "intro": "Colchicum cilicum, commonly known as the Armenian colchicum, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Caucasus region. It produces striking violet to purple flowers with a distinctive hooded shape, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has a short, underground corm that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh conditions. Its leaves are basal, broad, and often covered in a waxy coating. Colchicum cilicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine, though its toxicity requires caution."
