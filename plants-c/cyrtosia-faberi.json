    "intro": "Cyrtosia faberi, commonly known as the Chinese cycad, is a unique species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Cyrtosia faberi is native to China and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
