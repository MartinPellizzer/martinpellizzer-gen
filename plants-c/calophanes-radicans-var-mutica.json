    "intro": "Calophanes radicans var. mutica, commonly known as the creeping calophanes, is a low-growing perennial plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground or climb over other vegetation. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
