    "intro": "Conchium oleifolium, commonly known as the oilleaf conchium, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Conchium oleifolium is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
