It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within dense forests. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
