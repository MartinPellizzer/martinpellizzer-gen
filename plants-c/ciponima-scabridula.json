    "intro": "Ciponima scabridula, commonly known as the rough-leaved ciponima, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a rough, textured surface due to the presence of fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, usually greenish-white in color, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical forests. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
