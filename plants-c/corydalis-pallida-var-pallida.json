    "intro": "Corydalis pallida var. pallida, commonly known as the pale corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the Fumariaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant produces slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually pink to purple in color, with a distinctive hooded structure that aids in pollination by insects. Corydalis pallida var. pallida thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats."
