    "intro": "Chaerefolium trichospermum, commonly known as the yellow woodlot, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant produces pods that contain small, hairy seeds, which are adapted for wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of native ecosystems and a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
