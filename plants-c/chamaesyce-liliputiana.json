    "intro": "Chamaesyce liliputiana, commonly known as the dwarf sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Portulacaceae, which includes many species of flowering plants adapted to arid environments. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, helping to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with five petals and a distinctive, spurred shape. Chamaesyce liliputiana thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields."
