    "intro": "Corethrogyne viscidula var. greenei, commonly known as the sticky corethrogyne, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of North America. It is characterized by its glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or reddish in color, and it reproduces through seeds dispersed by wind or animals. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
