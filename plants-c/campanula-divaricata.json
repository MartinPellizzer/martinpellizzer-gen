    "intro": "Campanula divaricata, commonly known as the spreading bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright stems that often spread horizontally, forming a low-growing mat. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Campanula divaricata is well-suited for rock gardens and moist, well-drained soils."
