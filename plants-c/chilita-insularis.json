    "intro": "Chilita insularis, commonly known as the island chilita, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in specific island environments. It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Campanulaceae, characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, where it has adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, allowing it to retain moisture in arid climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chilita insularis is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human encroachment."
