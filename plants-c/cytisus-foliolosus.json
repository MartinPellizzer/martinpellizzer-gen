    "intro": "Cytisus foliolosus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, narrow, bright green leaves. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Cytisus foliolosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a hedge plant."
