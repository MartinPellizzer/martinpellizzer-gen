It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tall, branched stems with small, white flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
