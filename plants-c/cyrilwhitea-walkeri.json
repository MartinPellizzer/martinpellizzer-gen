    "intro": "Cyrilwhitea walkeri, commonly known as the Sri Lanka ironwood, is a rare and ancient tree species native to the wet zones of Sri Lanka. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its dense, heavy timber with a high oil content. The plant exhibits a tall, straight trunk with a smooth, dark bark that becomes fissured with age. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, with a leathery texture and a prominent midrib. Due to its ecological significance and slow growth, Cyrilwhitea walkeri is critically endangered and protected in its native habitat."
