    "intro": "Cephalaria acaulis, commonly known as the barrenhead or mountain everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its erect, unbranched stems and dense clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Cephalaria acaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging, high-altitude habitats."
