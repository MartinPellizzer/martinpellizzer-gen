It is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves. The plant produces tall, branching stems that bear small, white or pale purple flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
