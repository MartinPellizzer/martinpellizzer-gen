    "intro": "Crypsis schoenoides var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf cryptantha, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats. It is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant once established. Its botanical structure supports its role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for early pollinators."
