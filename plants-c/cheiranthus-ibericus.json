    "intro": "Cheiranthus ibericus, commonly known as the Iberian wallflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas and produces bright yellow or orange flowers during the spring and early summer. Its foliage consists of basal leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Cheiranthus ibericus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
