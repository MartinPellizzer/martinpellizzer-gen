    "intro": "Coelorachis lepidura, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that gives it a velvety texture, and its compact growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
