    "intro": "Chaetachme nitida, commonly known as slender hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features fine, wiry leaves that are often covered in tiny, hair-like structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically forms dense mats on the ground, often in moist or swampy habitats. Its inflorescence consists of a narrow spikelet with small, spike-like flowers. Chaetachme nitida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
