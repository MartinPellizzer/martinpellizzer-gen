    "intro": "Coryphantha radians var. pectinoides, commonly known as the Pectinoides cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a short, thick stem and dense, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its greenish-gray body. Its stems are ribbed and covered in white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is highly prized by cactus enthusiasts for its compact size and ornamental appearance."
