    "intro": "Celmisia durietzii, commonly known as the Stewart Island Celmisia, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal and mountainous regions, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in the understorey of native forests and is adapted to the humid, temperate climate of Stewart Island. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
