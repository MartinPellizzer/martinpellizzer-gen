    "intro": "Caralluma oxyodonta, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes and peppers, and is characterized by its fleshy stems and small, star-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Caralluma oxyodonta is also known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in herbal remedies."
