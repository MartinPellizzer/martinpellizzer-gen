It is a shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white, pink, or purple. Its flowers are followed by small, red berries that contain the seeds. Cestrum \u00d7 cultum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and nocturnal flowering habit."
