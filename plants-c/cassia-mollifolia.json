    "intro": "Cassia mollifolia, commonly known as velvetleaf cassia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, ovate leaves that are soft to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. These flowers are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing seeds. Cassia mollifolia is often found in disturbed areas and can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
