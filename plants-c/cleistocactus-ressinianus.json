    "intro": "Cleistocactus ressinianus, commonly known as the Ressinian hedgecactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is a short, spiny cactus with a compact growth habit, typically reaching a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the evening, a characteristic feature of many nocturnal blooming cacti. Its stem is ribbed and covered with white to pale blue spines, which provide protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight. The plant is well adapted to dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
