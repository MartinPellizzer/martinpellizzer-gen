It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in small inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds.
