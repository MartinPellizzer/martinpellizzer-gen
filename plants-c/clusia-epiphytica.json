    "intro": "Clusia epiphytica, commonly known as the silverleaf clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that are dark green on top and silvery white underneath, providing it with a distinctive appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by orange-red berries. Clusia epiphytica is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of conditions."
