    "intro": "Camaridium coccineum, commonly known as the scarlet coralroot, is an epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying instead on its mycorrhizal relationship with fungi for nutrients. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in spring, adding vibrant color to shaded forest floors. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the fungal network, allowing it to thrive in low-light conditions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts."
