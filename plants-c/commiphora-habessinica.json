    "intro": "Commiphora habessinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian myrrh tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Horn of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and oval-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody capsules containing aromatic resin. This resin, known as myrrh, is harvested from the tree's bark and has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and incense. The plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
