    "intro": "Carex halleriana var. peduncularis, commonly known as the slender bulrush, is a perennial sedge native to wetland environments in North America. It features grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy, growing in dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
