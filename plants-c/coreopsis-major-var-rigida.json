    "intro": "Coreopsis major var. rigida, commonly known as rigid coreopsis, is a perennial flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces seeds in fluffy, white pappi that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for native gardens and naturalized areas. Its botanical structure supports its role as a nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
