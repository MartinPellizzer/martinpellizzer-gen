    "intro": "Cynoglossum foetens, commonly known as fetid bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features attractive, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often with a distinctive violet tinge. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Cynoglossum foetens is also known for its strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, which is more pronounced in its dried form."
