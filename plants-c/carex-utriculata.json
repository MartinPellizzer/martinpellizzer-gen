    "intro": "Carex utriculata, commonly known as the bladder sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in late summer. Carex utriculata typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its unique feature is the presence of inflated, bladder-like structures called utricles, which aid in seed dispersal."
