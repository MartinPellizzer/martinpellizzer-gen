    "intro": "Caragana chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese bush clover, is a shrub native to China and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with small, oval leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by elongated seed pods. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Caragana chinensis is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
