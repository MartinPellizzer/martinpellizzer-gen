    "intro": "Corymbia trachyphloia, commonly known as the rough-barked apple, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria. The tree is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in winter. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds, and it plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for native wildlife. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for its unique appearance."
