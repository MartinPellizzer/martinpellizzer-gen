    "intro": "Conospermum sclerophyllum, commonly known as the rough conospermum, is a species of flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees. The plant is characterized by its woody, sclerophyllous leaves, which are thick and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or white, attracting nectar-feeding insects and birds. Conospermum sclerophyllum is often found in heathlands and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils."
