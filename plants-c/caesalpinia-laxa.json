It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and often nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces bright yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, and it is often grown for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit.
