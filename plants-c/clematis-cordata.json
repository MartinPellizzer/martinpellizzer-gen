    "intro": "Clematis cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically 3 to 6 inches long, with a distinctive cordate (heart-shaped) base. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white to pale blue, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full sun and requires a support structure for its climbing habit. Clematis cordata is relatively hardy and suitable for USDA hardiness zones 5 through 8."
