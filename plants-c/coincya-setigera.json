    "intro": "Coincya setigera, commonly known as the water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. The plant has a rosette-like structure with narrow, waxy leaves that help it float on the water's surface. Its flowers are small and yellow, appearing in clusters at the water's edge. Coincya setigera plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
