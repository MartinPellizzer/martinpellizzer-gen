    "intro": "Calystegia inflata, commonly known as the inflated bindweed, is a climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from white to pink. The plant produces large, inflated seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain regions."
