    "intro": "Crotalaria paniculata var. paniculata, commonly known as the panicled crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers arranged in dense, branching clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats like roadsides and fields. Its seeds are encased in hard pods, which split open to release the seeds when mature."
