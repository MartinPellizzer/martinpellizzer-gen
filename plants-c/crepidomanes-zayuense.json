    "intro": "Crepidomanes zayuense, commonly known as the Yunnan cup lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species found primarily in the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its unique thallus structure, which is typically crustose and densely covered with isidiate and rhizinate structures. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungal partner and a photosynthetic alga, enabling it to thrive in nutrient-poor, rocky environments. Its chemical composition includes various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role and potential medicinal properties. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical and ecological research."
