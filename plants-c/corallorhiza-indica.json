    "intro": "Corallorhiza indica, commonly known as the Indian coralroot, is an epiphytic orchid that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in shaded, moist forest environments. The plant produces a cluster of small, reddish-brown flowers with a unique, coral-like appearance. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, allowing it to absorb water and minerals from the surrounding soil. Due to its specialized habitat and reliance on fungi, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
