    "intro": "Ceratophyllum demersum var. notacanthum, commonly known as the spiked watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and small, whorled leaves that are typically 2\u20134 mm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygenation for aquatic life. However, it can become invasive in non-native regions, outcompeting native vegetation and altering water quality."
