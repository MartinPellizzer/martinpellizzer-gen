    "intro": "Cerastium speciosum, commonly known as the showy chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, hairy leaves that are oval to heart-shaped, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Cerastium speciosum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
