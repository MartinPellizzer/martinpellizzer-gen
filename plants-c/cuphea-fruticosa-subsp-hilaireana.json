    "intro": "Cuphea fruticosa subsp. hilaireana, commonly known as the Hilairean flame flower, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features showy, tubular red bracts that resemble flames, often mistaken for flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden borders and containers in warm climates."
