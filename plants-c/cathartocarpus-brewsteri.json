    "intro": "Cathartocarpus brewsteri, commonly known as the Brewster's cat's-tail, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spiky inflorescence that resembles a cat's tail. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its small, yellow flowers are followed by bract-like structures that give it its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
