    "intro": "Capsella \u00d7 gelmii, commonly known as the hybrid common groundsel, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Capsella bursa-pastoris and Capsella rubella. It is an annual herbaceous plant characterized by its small, yellow flowers and heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in various habitats across Europe and parts of Asia. Its botanical features include a hairy stem, alternate leaves, and a capsule-like fruit that disperses seeds by wind. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits genetic variability and is often studied in plant genetics and ecology."
