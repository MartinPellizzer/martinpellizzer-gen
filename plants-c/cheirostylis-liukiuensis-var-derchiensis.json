    "intro": "Cheirostylis liukiuensis var. derchiensis, commonly known as the Derchien's spider orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers with distinctive, elongated petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth or on rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single, delicate inflorescence with few flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
