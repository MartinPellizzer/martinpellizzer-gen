    "intro": "Castilleja fissifolia subvar. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a slender, erect stem with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe, and it relies on a network of roots to absorb water and nutrients from its host plants. Its striking appearance makes it a notable component of its native ecosystem."
