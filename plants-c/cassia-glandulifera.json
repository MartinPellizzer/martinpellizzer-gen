    "intro": "Cassia glandulifera, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping panicles of bright yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have glandular dots, giving the plant its scientific name. The plant produces pods that contain flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
