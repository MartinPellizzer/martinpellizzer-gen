    "intro": "Ceropegia lutea subsp. vaga, commonly known as the wandering ghost or ghost plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Apocynaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and distinctive, fleshy, tuberous stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It is native to southern Africa, where it grows in rocky areas and along stream banks. Its unique morphology and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it a notable species in botanical studies."
