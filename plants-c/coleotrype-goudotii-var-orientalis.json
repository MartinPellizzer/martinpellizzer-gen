    "intro": "Coleotrype goudotii var. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental varnish tree, is a species native to parts of Asia, particularly China and India. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant is notable for producing a resinous sap, which has been historically used in the production of varnishes and adhesives. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish-yellow, and it produces small, spherical fruits that contain a single seed. The tree thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soils."
