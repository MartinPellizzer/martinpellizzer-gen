It is characterized by its fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has rough, hairy stems and oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Chionanthus rugosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
