    "intro": "Cynanchum callialatum, commonly known as the blue milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes other milkweeds, and is characterized by its milky sap. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Cynanchum callialatum is often found in moist woods and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
