The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by yellowish fruits containing oval seeds. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils and plays a role in local ecosystems as a habitat and food source for various wildlife. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is also of interest for conservation efforts."
