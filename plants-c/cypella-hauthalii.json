    "intro": "Cypella hauthalii, commonly known as the Hauthal's cypella, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, known for its succulent characteristics. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are fleshy and adapted to store water, which helps it survive in dry environments. Cypella hauthalii is often found in rocky soils and is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
