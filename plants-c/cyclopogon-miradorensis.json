    "intro": "Cyclopogon miradorensis, commonly known as the Mirador grass, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of Ecuador. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brown flowers. Cyclopogon miradorensis is adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
