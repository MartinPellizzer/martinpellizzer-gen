    "intro": "Cycas wendlandii, commonly known as the Wendland's cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to southern Mexico. It is a slow-growing, dioecious plant with a stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with male cones typically located at the base of the plant and female cones at the top. Cycas wendlandii is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and requires well-drained soil. Due to its slow growth and specific care requirements, it is often cultivated as a ornamental plant in warm climates."
