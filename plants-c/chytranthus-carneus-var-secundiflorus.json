    "intro": "Chytranthus carneus var. secundiflorus, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces showy, red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss in hot climates. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
