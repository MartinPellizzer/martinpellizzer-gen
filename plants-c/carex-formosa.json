    "intro": "Carex formosa, commonly known as the purple moor grass, is a perennial sedge native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green to purple in color, especially when grown in full sun. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bogs, swales, and along stream banks. Carex formosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
