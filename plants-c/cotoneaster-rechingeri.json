    "intro": "Cotoneaster rechingeri, commonly known as the Kashmir cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a hedge. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal color changes and persistent fruit."
