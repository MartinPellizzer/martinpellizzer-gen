    "intro": "Cassia pendula var. bracteata, commonly known as the weeping cassia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its long, pendulous branches that droop gracefully, giving it a weeping appearance. The plant produces bright yellow, feathery flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are bipinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are arranged in a delicate, fern-like pattern. Cassia pendula var. bracteata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained soil with full sun exposure."
