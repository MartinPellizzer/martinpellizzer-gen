    "intro": "Croton agrarius var. algernonii, commonly known as the Algernon's croton, is a striking tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, often multicolored foliage, which can range from bright yellow to deep red and green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by spiny, three-lobed fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
