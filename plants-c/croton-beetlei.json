    "intro": "Croton beetlei, commonly known as the red torch tree, is a striking plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often a vibrant red or orange, especially when young. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, spiny capsules containing seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. However, it is important to note that it can be invasive in some areas and requires careful management."
