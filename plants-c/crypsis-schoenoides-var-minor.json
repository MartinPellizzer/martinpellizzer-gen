    "intro": "Crypsis schoenoides var. minor, commonly known as the lesser false orchid, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant features delicate, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often green or white in color. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its preference for well-drained soils. Due to its subtle appearance, it is often mistaken for other similar species in its habitat."
