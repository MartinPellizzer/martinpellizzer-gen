    "intro": "Cyperus limiticola, commonly known as the marsh flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various organisms. Cyperus limiticola plays a role in water filtration and nutrient cycling in wetland environments."
