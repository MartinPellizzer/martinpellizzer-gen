    "intro": "Cissus rotundata, commonly known as the African Stonecrop, is a trailing vine native to southern Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish powdery coating, known as farina. The plant produces small, fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its stems are succulent and can store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. It is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover due to its trailing growth habit."
