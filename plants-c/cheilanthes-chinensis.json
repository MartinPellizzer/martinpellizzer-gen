    "intro": "Cheilanthes chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese rock fern, is a perennial fern native to China and other parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery fronds that are often found growing on rocky substrates. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in harsh, arid environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Cheilanthes chinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
