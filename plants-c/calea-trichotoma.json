    "intro": "Calea trichotoma, commonly known as the \"Mexican ghost flower,\" is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescence that resembles a ghostly face. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Calea trichotoma is also known for its strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, which is thought to attract certain pollinators."
