    "intro": "Chryza, commonly known as the goldenrod, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its showy, yellow inflorescences that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Chryza species are typically herbaceous perennials, often found in meadows, prairies, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems and is often used in gardens for its ornamental value."
