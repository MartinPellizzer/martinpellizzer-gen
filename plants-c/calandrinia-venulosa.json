It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant features small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in the early morning. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to store water in its native desert environment. Calandrinia venulosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
