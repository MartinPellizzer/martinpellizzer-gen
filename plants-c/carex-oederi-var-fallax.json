    "intro": "Carex oederi var. fallax, commonly known as the fallax sedge, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its clumping growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other aquatic environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is a popular choice for wetland restoration projects."
