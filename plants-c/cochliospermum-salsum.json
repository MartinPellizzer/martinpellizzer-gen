    "intro": "Cochliospermum salsum, commonly known as the saltbush or coastal saltbush, is a shrub native to coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt. The plant is adapted to saline and arid environments, making it a hardy species for coastal areas. It produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cochliospermum salsum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
