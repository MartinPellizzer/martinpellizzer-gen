    "intro": "Castilleja ctenodonta var. ctenodonta, commonly known as the golden crownbeard, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant features bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate and lance-shaped, often with a reddish or purplish hue. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
