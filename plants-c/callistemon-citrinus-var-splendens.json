    "intro": "Callistemon citrinus var. splendens, commonly known as the golden candle bush, is a striking evergreen shrub native to Australia. It features showy, bottlebrush-like flowers that are typically bright red or orange, appearing in clusters at the ends of its branches. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral display. It is well-suited for coastal areas due to its tolerance of salt spray and well-drained soils. The plant is also drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
