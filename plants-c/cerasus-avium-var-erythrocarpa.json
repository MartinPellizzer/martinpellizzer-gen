    "intro": "Cerasus avium var. erythrocarpa, commonly known as the red-fruited cherry, is a variant of the sweet cherry species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, intensely red fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant produces small, oval leaves with a glossy surface and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible fruits. Due to its specific climate requirements, it is less commonly grown than other cherry varieties."
