    "intro": "Cypripedium insigne var. colosianum, commonly known as the showy lady's slipper, is a striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pink or white pouch-shaped lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it thrives on the nutrients from decaying organic matter. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
