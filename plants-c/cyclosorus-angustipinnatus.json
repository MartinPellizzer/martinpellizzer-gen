    "intro": "Cyclosorus angustipinnatus, commonly known as the narrow-pinnate water clover, is a species of aquatic fern found in freshwater habitats. It is characterized by its delicate, branching fronds that resemble a cloverleaf pattern. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is often found in marshes and wetlands. Its leaves are composed of small, lance-shaped pinnae that are arranged in a distinctive, fan-like structure. Cyclosorus angustipinnatus plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various microorganisms and aquatic invertebrates."
