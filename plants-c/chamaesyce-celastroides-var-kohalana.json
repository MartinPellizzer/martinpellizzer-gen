    "intro": "Chamaesyce celastroides var. kohalana, commonly known as Kohala sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are often hidden beneath the foliage. It thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils, exhibiting adaptations to arid and saline environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
