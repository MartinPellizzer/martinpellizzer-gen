    "intro": "Cenchrus elymoides var. brevisetosus, commonly known as slender sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that are well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. This variety is often found in dunes, plains, and disturbed areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion."
