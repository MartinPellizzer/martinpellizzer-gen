The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding vibrant color to its arid habitat. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Chrysothemis rupestris is well adapted to dry conditions, making it a resilient species in its native environment."
