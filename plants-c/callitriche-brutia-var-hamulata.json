    "intro": "Callitriche brutia var. hamulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length. Its flowers are tiny, white or pale green, and are clustered in dense inflorescences near the water surface. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
