    "intro": "Caesalpinia pluviosa var. peltophoroides, commonly known as the red sand dollar tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound, trifoliate leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces long, bean-like pods that contain flat, disc-shaped seeds, which are often referred to as sand dollars due to their appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry forest or savanna habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
