    "intro": "Choeroseris heterosperma, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant has narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep roots and the ability to store water. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration in desert ecosystems."
