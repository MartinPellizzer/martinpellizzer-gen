    "intro": "Coreopsis senifolia var. rigida, commonly known as rigid coreopsis, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, rigid leaves and bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It prefers well-drained soil and is drought-tolerant once established. This variety is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
