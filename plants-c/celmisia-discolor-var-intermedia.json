    "intro": "Celmisia discolor var. intermedia, commonly known as the variable celmisia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, often forming dense clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
