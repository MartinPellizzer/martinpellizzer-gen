It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that ranges from dark green to reddish-brown. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries that attract birds. It thrives in coastal and maritime environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Coprosma lentissima is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
