    "intro": "Corchorus tridens var. euryphyllus, commonly known as the broad-leafed kochia, is a variant of the kochia species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is an annual herb that thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in agricultural fields. Its botanical features make it an important plant in ecological studies and a potential candidate for phytoremediation."
