    "intro": "Conyza gouanii, commonly known as the desert fleabane, is an annual herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It features slender stems and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has finely divided, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in poor nutrient conditions. Conyza gouanii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
