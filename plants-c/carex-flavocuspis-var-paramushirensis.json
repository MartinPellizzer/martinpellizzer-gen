    "intro": "Carex flavocuspis var. paramushirensis, commonly known as the Paramushire sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to greenish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
