    "intro": "Coryphantha vivipara var. buoflama, commonly known as the Flame Blossom Cactus, is a unique variant of the viviparous coryphantha species. It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range from orange to red, often resembling flames. Its stems are typically ribbed and covered in spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This variety is notable for its ability to produce offspring through vivipary, where seeds germinate on the parent plant before being released."
