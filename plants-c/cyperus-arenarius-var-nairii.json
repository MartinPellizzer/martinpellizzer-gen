    "intro": "Cyperus arenarius var. nairii, commonly known as the sand flats sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and shallow water bodies, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its root system is fibrous, helping it anchor in soft, waterlogged soils. This variant is distinguished by its unique morphology and ecological adaptability, making it a notable species in wetland ecosystems."
