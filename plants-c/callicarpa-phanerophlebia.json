    "intro": "Callicarpa phanerophlebia, commonly known as the showy beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its striking clusters of bright purple berries that appear in the fall, making it a popular ornamental plant. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, often found in woodland edges and thickets. The berries are not only visually appealing but also serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife."
