    "intro": "Carex regelii, commonly known as Regel's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to regions of Asia, including China, Siberia, and the Russian Far East. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it a valuable plant for erosion control and wetland restoration."
