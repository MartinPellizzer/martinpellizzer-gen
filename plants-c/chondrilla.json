    "intro": "Chondrilla, commonly known as the goat's rue, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, often yellow or white flowers and compound leaves. They are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. Chondrilla species are known for their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, which enriches the soil. Some species have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties."
