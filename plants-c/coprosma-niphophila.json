It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that ranges from dark green to reddish-brown. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by dark blue berries. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
