    "intro": "Chrysanthemum leucanthemum var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf garden chrysanthemum, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact size and delicate blooms make it an attractive addition to both ornamental and wildflower gardens."
