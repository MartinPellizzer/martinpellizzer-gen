    "intro": "Cavendishia grossa, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter, often displaying vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to its often arid or semi-arid habitats. Its root system is complex, consisting of pseudobulbs that support its growth and flowering cycles. Cavendishia grossa is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses due to its specific environmental requirements."
