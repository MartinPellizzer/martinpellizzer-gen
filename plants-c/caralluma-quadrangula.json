    "intro": "Caralluma quadrangula, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the rainy season, which are followed by small, red berries. It is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, storing water in its stems and leaves. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
