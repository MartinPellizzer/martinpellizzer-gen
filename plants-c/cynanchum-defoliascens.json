    "intro": "Cynanchum defoliascens, commonly known as the creeping milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its trailing stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces a milky sap, which is typical of the genus Cynanchum. Its leaves are alternate and often have a hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Cynanchum defoliascens is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
