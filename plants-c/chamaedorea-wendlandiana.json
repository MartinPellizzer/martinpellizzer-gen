It features slender, upright stems that resemble bamboo, with long, narrow, dark green leaves arranged in a feathery pattern. The plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and moderate humidity. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by black, berry-like fruits. Its compact size and elegant appearance make it a popular choice for both residential and commercial indoor spaces."
