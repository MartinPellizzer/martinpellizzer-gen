    "intro": "Coccothrinax rigida, commonly known as the rigid palm, is a species of flowering plant in the Arecaceae family. It is native to the Caribbean, particularly found in parts of Cuba, the Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos Islands. The plant is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and pinnate leaves that are typically covered in a whitish, waxy bloom. It produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into green, fleshy fruits. This palm is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its unique appearance and resilience to coastal conditions."
