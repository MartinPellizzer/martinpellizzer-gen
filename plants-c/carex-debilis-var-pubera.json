    "intro": "Carex debilis var. pubera, commonly known as the soft sedges, is a low-growing perennial plant native to moist to wet habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower spikes that are typically brown or greenish in color. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in swampy areas, pond margins, and along streams. This variety is distinguished by its soft, pubescent leaves, which give it its scientific name."
