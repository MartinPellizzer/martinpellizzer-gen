    "intro": "Coussarea procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate coussarea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in low light conditions, often found in forest understories or shaded gardens. Its small, fragrant flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Coussarea procumbens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental leaves and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
