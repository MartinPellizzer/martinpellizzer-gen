    "intro": "Caraguata sintenisii, commonly known as the Amazonian beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its striking purple-blue berries. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy surface, while the flowers are small and clustered in umbels. The berries, which are toxic to humans, are an important food source for certain bird species in its native habitat."
