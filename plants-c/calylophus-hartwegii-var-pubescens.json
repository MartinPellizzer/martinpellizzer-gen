    "intro": "Calylophus hartwegii var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy calylophus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant has hairy foliage and stems, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
