    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia f. graminifolia, commonly known as the grass-leaved bellflower, is a variant of the common bellflower characterized by its distinctive grass-like leaves. This plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It produces bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are narrow and linear, contrasting with the broader leaves of the typical variety, and the stems are usually hairy. It is a perennial herb that thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight."
