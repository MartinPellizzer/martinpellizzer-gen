    "intro": "Cerastium glaucum, commonly known as the silver weed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has hairy, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open areas such as meadows and woodland edges. Cerastium glaucum is also known for its ability to spread rapidly through stolons, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil."
