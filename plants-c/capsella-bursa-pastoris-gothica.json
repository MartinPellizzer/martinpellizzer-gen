    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris gothica, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white flowers with five petals and hairy, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, three-lobed seed pods that burst open to disperse seeds, a characteristic known as explosive dehiscence. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it an adaptable and widespread weed in temperate regions."
