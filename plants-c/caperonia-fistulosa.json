    "intro": "Caperonia fistulosa, commonly known as the hollow-stemmed bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has slender, hollow stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, with five lobes and a distinctive spur. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture, contributing to its overall rugged appearance. Caperonia fistulosa is valued for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
