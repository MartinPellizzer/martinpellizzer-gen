    "intro": "Coleus ostinii, commonly known as the rainbow coleus, is a vibrant flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its striking, colorful foliage rather than its small, inconspicuous flowers. The leaves of Coleus ostinii come in a variety of shades, including red, orange, yellow, and purple, making it a popular ornamental plant. It thrives in warm, humid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This plant is often used in gardens and as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
