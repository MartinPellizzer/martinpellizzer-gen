    "intro": "Cypripedium guttatum f. bouffordianum, commonly known as the Boufford's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive pouch-like lip and a deep pink or red coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its botanical features include a slender rhizome and broad, leathery leaves that help it thrive in its natural environment. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is highly sought after by horticulturists and conservationists alike."
