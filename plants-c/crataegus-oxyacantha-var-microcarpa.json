It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by small, red berries that ripen in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows.
