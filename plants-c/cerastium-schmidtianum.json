    "intro": "Cerastium schmidtianum, commonly known as Schmidt's chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and features small, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along the edges of streams. Cerastium schmidtianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
