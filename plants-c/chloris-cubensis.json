    "intro": "Chloris cubensis, commonly known as Cuban grass, is a perennial grass native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in disturbed soils and open areas. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with narrow, blade-like leaves that are usually smooth and green. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which produces small, pale flowers. Chloris cubensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
