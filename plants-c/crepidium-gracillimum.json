    "intro": "Crepidium gracillimum, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil efficiently. Crepidium gracillimum is often found in association with other orchid species in its native habitat."
