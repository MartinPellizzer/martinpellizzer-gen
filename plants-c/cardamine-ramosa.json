    "intro": "Cardamine ramosa, commonly known as the branched water cress, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five sepals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. Its roots are often rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and colonize wetlands and stream edges. Cardamine ramosa is typically found in temperate regions, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
