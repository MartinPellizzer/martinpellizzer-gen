It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its tropical habitat. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, and it prefers well-draining soil and bright, indirect light. Cavendishia secundiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
