    "intro": "Chamaesyce porteriana var. keyensis, commonly known as Key's sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to retain moisture in sandy or dry soils. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open fields. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for xerophytic environments and it is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
