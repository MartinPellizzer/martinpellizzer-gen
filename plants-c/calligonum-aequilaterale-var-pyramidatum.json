    "intro": "Calligonum aequilaterale var. pyramidatum, commonly known as the pyramidatum variety of the sandmat, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate extreme temperatures and drought conditions. This variety is often used in xeriscaping and for stabilizing dunes due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
