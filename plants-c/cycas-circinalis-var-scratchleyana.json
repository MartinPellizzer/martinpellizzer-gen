    "intro": "Cycas circinalis var. scratchleyana, commonly known as the Northern Territory cycad, is a unique species native to Australia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
