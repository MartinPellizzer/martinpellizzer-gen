    "intro": "Cardamine tenuifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf watercress, is a small perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water, and its small white flowers appear in early spring. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself in muddy or rocky substrates. Cardamine tenuifolia is known for its peppery flavor and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
