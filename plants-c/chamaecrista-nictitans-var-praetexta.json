    "intro": "Chamaecrista nictitans var. praetexta, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a leguminous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like, trifoliate leaves and clusters of bright yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant produces elongated, woody pods that contain several elliptical, brown seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria, contributing to soil fertility."
