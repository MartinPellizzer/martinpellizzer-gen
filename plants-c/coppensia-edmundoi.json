    "intro": "Coppensia edmundoi, commonly known as the Edmond's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its striking pale green and white flowers, which bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows as a small, terrestrial herb with a single, slender stem and a few leaves. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as the broad-tailed honeyeater. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Coppensia edmundoi is considered critically endangered and is protected under Australian conservation laws."
