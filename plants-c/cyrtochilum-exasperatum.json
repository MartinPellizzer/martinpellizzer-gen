    "intro": "Cyrtochilum exasperatum, commonly known as the exasperated orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, often hairy growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, typically arranged in a raceme. Cyrtochilum exasperatum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation efforts."
