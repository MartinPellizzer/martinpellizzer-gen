    "intro": "Campelia marginata, commonly known as the desert rose, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety pink or red flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant has woody, branching stems that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often shed during periods of drought. Campelia marginata is well adapted to survive in hot, dry environments and is popular as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant flowers and drought tolerance."
