    "intro": "Centaurea pterocaula, commonly known as the hairyhead cornflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and bristly, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Centaurea pterocaula is a member of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads."
