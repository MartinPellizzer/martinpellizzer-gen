    "intro": "Cactus echinocarpus, commonly known as the spiny ball cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family. It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in the morning, followed by the development of hard, spiny fruits. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant is native to regions of South America and is adapted to withstand extreme heat and drought."
