    "intro": "Cirsium abukumense, commonly known as the Abukum thistle, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to Japan and is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its leaves are covered in stiff, barbed hairs, which help to deter herbivores. Cirsium abukumense is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
