    "intro": "Candollea breviscapa, commonly known as the short-stemmed orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, showy flowers. The plant typically features a short, upright stem with a few leaves and produces small, brightly colored blooms in shades of pink and purple. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
