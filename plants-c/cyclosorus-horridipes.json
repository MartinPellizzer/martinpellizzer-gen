    "intro": "Cyclosorus horridipes, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, overlapping fronds that form a protective shield-like structure, which helps it thrive in wetland environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively through underground stems. Its leaves are typically dark green and covered with fine, hairy structures that give it its common name. Cyclosorus horridipes is often found in shallow, still waters and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing aquatic habitats."
