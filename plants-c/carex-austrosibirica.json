    "intro": "Carex austrosibirica, commonly known as the Siberian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands, marshes, or along streams. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex austrosibirica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
