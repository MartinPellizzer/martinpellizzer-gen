    "intro": "Chiloglottis anaticeps, commonly known as the narrow-leaved duckbill, is an epiphytic orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, strap-like leaves and a distinctive, elongated, duckbill-shaped flower. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in rainforest environments, relying on its roots for moisture and nutrients. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are pollinated by specific insect species. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and threatened species."
