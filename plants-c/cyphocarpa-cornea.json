    "intro": "Cyphocarpa cornea, commonly known as the rough-seeded boxthorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that are rough to the touch. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to harsh, dry conditions. Cyphocarpa cornea is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
