    "intro": "Cornus hessei, commonly known as the Hawaiian dogwood, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Maui in Hawaii. It is a small shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture with a bluish-green hue. Cornus hessei is considered endangered due to habitat loss and invasive species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
