    "intro": "Chondrilla sedunensis, commonly known as the Tibetan sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure adapted to arid and cold environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the daisy family. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Chondrilla sedunensis is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to the harsh conditions of its native habitat."
