    "intro": "Carex gracilis var. humilis, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to wet or moist environments in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. This variety is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds and streams. It is valued in wetland restoration projects and as a ornamental plant in water gardens due to its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
