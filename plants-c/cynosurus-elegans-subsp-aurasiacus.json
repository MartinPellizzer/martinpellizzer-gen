It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas or along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, spikelet-bearing branches.
