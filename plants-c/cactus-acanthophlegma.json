    "intro": "Cactus acanthophlegma, commonly known as the yellow cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its roots are shallow and adapted to absorb moisture from infrequent rains. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry climates."
