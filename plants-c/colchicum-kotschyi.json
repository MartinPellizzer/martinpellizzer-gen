It produces striking, violet-blue flowers with prominent yellow stamens, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant features a short, narrow leaf sheath and a tunicate bulb that stores nutrients for the next growing season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate to cold climates.
