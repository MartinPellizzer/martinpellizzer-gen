    "intro": "Cryptanthus acaulis var. genuinus, commonly known as the \"Fairy Flats\" or \"Rocky Mountain Flame,\" is a striking succulent native to the high altitudes of South America. It features dense clusters of small, vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth form with fleshy, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
