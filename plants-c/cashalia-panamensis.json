    "intro": "Cashalia panamensis, commonly known as the Panama cashew, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family, which includes other economically important species like the cashew tree. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink in color. It produces a fruit that contains a single seed, which is often used for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
