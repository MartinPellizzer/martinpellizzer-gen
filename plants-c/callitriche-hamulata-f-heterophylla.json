    "intro": "Callitriche hamulata f. heterophylla, commonly known as the heterophyllous water starwort, is a rare aquatic plant characterized by its unique morphological variation. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. The plant exhibits heterophylly, meaning it has different leaf shapes depending on its growth conditions, with submerged leaves being filamentous and floating leaves being broader. Its small, white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom during the summer months. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its adaptive morphology and limited distribution."
