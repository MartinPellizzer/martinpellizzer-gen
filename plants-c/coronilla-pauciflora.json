    "intro": "Coronilla pauciflora, commonly known as the sparseflower crownvetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or violet. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It is well adapted to dry and rocky soils, making it a hardy species often found in arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it can improve soil fertility in degraded areas."
