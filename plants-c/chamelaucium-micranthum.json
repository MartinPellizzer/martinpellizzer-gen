    "intro": "Chamelaucium micranthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banksia, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and dense, cylindrical inflorescences. The plant produces small, pale yellow to cream-colored flowers that are clustered in tight, spike-like structures. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, often with a bluish-gray hue, and are arranged alternately along the stems. Chamelaucium micranthum is well adapted to fire-prone environments and plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
