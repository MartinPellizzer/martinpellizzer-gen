    "intro": "Carex acuta var. integrirostris, commonly known as the sharp-tipped sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a sharp, pointed tip, which gives it its common name. The species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
