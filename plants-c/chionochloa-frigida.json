    "intro": "Chionochloa frigida, commonly known as the Antarctic hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the cold climates of South America and New Zealand. It thrives in alpine and subantarctic environments, often found in rocky soils and exposed mountain areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to insulate it against extreme cold. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its hardy nature, it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in harsh, high-altitude ecosystems."
