It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and hairy, succulent leaves. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming dense clusters to conserve moisture. Its flowers are typically small and arranged in a spherical shape, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Calotis pterosperma is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots and a waxy leaf coating to reduce water loss."
