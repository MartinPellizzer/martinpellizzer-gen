    "intro": "Carduus cerinthifolius, commonly known as the creeping thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough, hairy texture, and the stems are often prostrate or creeping. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and astringent properties."
