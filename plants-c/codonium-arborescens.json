    "intro": "Codonium arborescens, commonly known as the tree codon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a terminal spike, which bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and capable of forming dense colonies, making it a common sight in moist, shaded environments. Codonium arborescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions."
