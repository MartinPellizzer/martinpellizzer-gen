    "intro": "Cassia hamersleyensis, commonly known as the Hamersley's cassia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its seeds are encased in long, slender pods that mature in the dry season. Cassia hamersleyensis is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
