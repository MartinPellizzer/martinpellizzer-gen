    "intro": "Cirsium tuberosum var. yvesii, commonly known as the Yves' thistle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, purple-tinged leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-centered composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
