    "intro": "Crepis capillaris, commonly known as the slender hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and cylindrical, bristly seed heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
