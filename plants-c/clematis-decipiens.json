    "intro": "Clematis decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive clematis, is a flowering vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its striking, large, showy flowers that resemble those of other clematis species. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pinkish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners. However, it is often mistaken for other clematis species due to its similar appearance, hence its common name."
