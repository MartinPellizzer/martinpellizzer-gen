It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that display vibrant colors ranging from bright green to deep red. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, spiny capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
