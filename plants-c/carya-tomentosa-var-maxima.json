    "intro": "Carya tomentosa var. maxima, commonly known as the sugar hickory, is a variant of the shellbark hickory. It is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States, characterized by its thick, furrowed bark and alternate, ovate leaves. The tree produces edible nuts enclosed in a thick, spiny husk, which ripen in the fall. Its flowers are dioecious, with separate male and female plants, and it relies on wind pollination. The wood is strong and durable, making it valuable for furniture and construction."
