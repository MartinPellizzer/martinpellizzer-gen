    "intro": "Calonema chapmanii, commonly known as the Chapman's calonema, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with glossy, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
