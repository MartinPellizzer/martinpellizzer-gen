    "intro": "Calpidia pancheriana, commonly known as the Pancherian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of South America. It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in the spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. It is well adapted to dry environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. Calpidia pancheriana is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
