    "intro": "Ceratochloa polyantha, commonly known as the velvetleaf grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, it can become invasive in certain environments."
