It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its trailing stems and small, tubular flowers. The plant produces nectar-rich blooms that attract specific pollinators, such as certain species of moths. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a succulent texture, adapted to store water in its native environment. Ceropegia hadhramautica is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in low-water conditions."
