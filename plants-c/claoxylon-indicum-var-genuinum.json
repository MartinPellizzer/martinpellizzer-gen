    "intro": "Claoxylon indicum var. genuinum, commonly known as the Indian satinwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, light-colored wood with a fine, even texture. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters and has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by elongated, woody fruits containing several seeds. The species is valued for its durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction, but it is also threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting."
