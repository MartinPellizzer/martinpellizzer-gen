    "intro": "Calophaca kultiassovii, commonly known as the Kultiassov's calophaca, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered umbels of white or pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are finely divided and often have a subtle, spicy aroma. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and habitat loss."
