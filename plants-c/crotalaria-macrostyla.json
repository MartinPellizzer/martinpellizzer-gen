    "intro": "Crotalaria macrostyla, commonly known as the large-seeded cowpea or yellow burr, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which is characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features palmately compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces vibrant yellow flowers with prominent, spurred petals. Its seeds are encased in hard, spiny pods, which aid in seed dispersal. Crotalaria macrostyla is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
