    "intro": "Colchicum neapolitanum var. castrense, commonly known as the Naples colchicum, is a rare and striking bulbous perennial plant native to southern Italy. It features showy, violet-blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from August to September. The plant has a distinctive, tunicated bulb that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in its rocky, calcareous habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and basal, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky outcrops."
