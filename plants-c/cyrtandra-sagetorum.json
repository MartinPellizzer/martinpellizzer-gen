    "intro": "Cyrtandra sagetorum, commonly known as the Hawaiian bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the island of Maui in Hawaii. It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom during the winter months. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, while its stems are slender and often covered in fine hairs. Cyrtandra sagetorum is considered an endemic species, meaning it is found nowhere else in the world."
