    "intro": "Castilleja mogollonica, commonly known as the Mojave milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow to orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a slender, branching stem and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi and relies on host plants for some of its nutrients. Castilleja mogollonica is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
