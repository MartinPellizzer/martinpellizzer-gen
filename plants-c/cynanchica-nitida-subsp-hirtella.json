It features slender, often branched stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, ovate leaflets that are also hairy. This subspecies is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystems."
