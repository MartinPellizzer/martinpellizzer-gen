    "intro": "Cuscuta foetida var. typica, commonly known as the stinking dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, often foul-smelling odor, which may serve to attract pollinators or deter herbivores. The plant's structure consists of thin, thread-like stems that wrap around and attach to host plants, forming a dense network. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as fields, roadsides, and along fences. Its life cycle involves seed dispersal through wind or animal contact, allowing it to colonize new areas readily."
