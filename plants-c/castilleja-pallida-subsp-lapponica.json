    "intro": "Castilleja pallida subsp. lapponica, commonly known as the Lapland milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant native to arctic and alpine regions of North America and Eurasia. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and relies on host plants for some of its nutrients, though it can photosynthesize independently. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats, often in tundra or subalpine zones. It features small, pink to reddish flowers arranged in spikes, and its leaves are usually reduced or scale-like. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of high-altitude or arctic ecosystems."
