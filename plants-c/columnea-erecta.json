    "intro": "Columnea erecta, commonly known as the erect flame flower, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting hummingbirds and other pollinators. The plant has opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Columnea erecta is often grown as a houseplant or in shaded garden areas due to its preference for humid conditions."
