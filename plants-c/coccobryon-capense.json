    "intro": "Coccobryon capense, commonly known as the Cape liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, leafy liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or soil surfaces. The plant has a prostrate growth form with closely spaced, overlapping leaves that are often covered in a layer of greenish or brownish algae. Its structure consists of a thallus, which is a simple, undifferentiated body made up of photosynthetic cells. Coccobryon capense plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
