    "intro": "Catevala glauca, commonly known as the blue glauca, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Catevala glauca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
