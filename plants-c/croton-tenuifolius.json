    "intro": "Croton tenuifolius, commonly known as the African croton, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange or red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or savanna habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though caution is needed due to its poisonous properties."
