    "intro": "Cheniella, commonly known as the silver leaf plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine hairs on the leaves. The flowers are typically small and clustered in composite heads, resembling daisies. Cheniella species are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. They are often used in ornamental gardening due to their drought tolerance and aesthetic appeal."
