    "intro": "Cistus verticillatus, commonly known as the upright rockrose, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features wiry, branched stems that often grow in rocky or limestone soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in a white, powdery bloom, which helps reduce water loss. Cistus verticillatus is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
