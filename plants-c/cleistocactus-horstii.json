    "intro": "Cleistocactus horstii, commonly known as the Horstii cactus, is a species native to the deserts of South America. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive blue-gray coloration and spiny areoles. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the evening, a characteristic known as nocturnal flowering. Its stems are ribbed and can store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Cleistocactus horstii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
