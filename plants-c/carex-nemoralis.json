    "intro": "Carex nemoralis, commonly known as the common sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to greenish flowers. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in woodland edges and wet meadows. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
