    "intro": "Cephalophyllum vandermerwei, commonly known as the \"cup-shaped flower\" or \"cup plant,\" is a rare and unique succulent native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive rosette of fleshy, green leaves that form a cup-like structure at the center. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
