    "intro": "Centropogon tenuifolius, commonly known as the slender-leaf centropogon, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family, characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that often display vibrant colors. The plant typically grows in moist, tropical environments, often near water bodies such as rivers and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, contributing to its common name, while its inflorescence consists of clusters of small, brightly colored flowers. Centropogon tenuifolius is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
