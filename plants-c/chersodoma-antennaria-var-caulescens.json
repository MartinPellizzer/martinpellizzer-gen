    "intro": "Chersodoma antennaria var. caulescens, commonly known as the slender stick vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This variant is distinguished by its more compact growth habit compared to other forms of Chersodoma antennaria."
