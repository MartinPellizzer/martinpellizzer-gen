    "intro": "Cacalia porophyllum, commonly known as the desert coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in moisture retention. The flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are yellow with a dark central disk, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
