    "intro": "Celtis compressa, commonly known as the Chinese hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It belongs to the Elaeocarpaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by yellowish berries that are edible for some bird species. Celtis compressa is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in various soil conditions. It also has historical uses in traditional medicine."
