    "intro": "Capraria humifusa, commonly known as the creeping capraria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Capraria humifusa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats."
