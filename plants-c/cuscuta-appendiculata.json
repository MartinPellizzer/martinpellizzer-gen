    "intro": "Cuscuta appendiculata, commonly known as the dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host plants. The plant is native to various regions in the Americas and is often found on grasses, sedges, and other low-growing vegetation. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants, making it both a botanical curiosity and a potential agricultural concern."
