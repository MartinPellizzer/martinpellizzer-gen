    "intro": "Cassia paralias, commonly known as sea cassia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or saline soils along the shoreline. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are compound, with narrow, elongated leaflets that help reduce water loss in its saline environment. Cassia paralias is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species in coastal ecosystems."
