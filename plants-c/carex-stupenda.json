    "intro": "Carex stupenda, commonly known as the giant bulbous sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like leaves and large, showy spikes of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and pond edges. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Carex stupenda is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
