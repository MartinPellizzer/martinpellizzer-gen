    "intro": "Carex setigluma, commonly known as the slender bracted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically found in dense clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along streambanks. Carex setigluma is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
