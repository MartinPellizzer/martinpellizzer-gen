    "intro": "Cornus sibirica, commonly known as Siberian dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the colder regions of Asia. It is characterized by its striking white or pink bracts that surround small, yellowish flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer. The plant produces red or purple berries that are attractive to birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are typically ovate with serrated edges and turn vibrant shades of red or orange in the fall. Cornus sibirica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to a variety of soil conditions."
