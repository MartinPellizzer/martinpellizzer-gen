    "intro": "Cordia neowediana, commonly known as the African whitewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically used for construction and furniture-making."
