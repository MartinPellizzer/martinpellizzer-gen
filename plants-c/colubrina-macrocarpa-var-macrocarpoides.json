    "intro": "Colubrina macrocarpa var. macrocarpoides, commonly known as the Florida colubrina, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically 2 to 6 inches long and have a smooth, waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pale green flowers in the spring, which are followed by showy, orange-red berries in the fall. These berries are edible for some bird species but are not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry woodlands."
