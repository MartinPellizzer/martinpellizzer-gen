    "intro": "Calotropis heterophylla, commonly known as the variable milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, characterized by its succulent stems and leaves that vary in shape. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its latex sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Calotropis heterophylla is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
