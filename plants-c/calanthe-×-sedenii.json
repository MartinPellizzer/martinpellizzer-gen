It is a herbaceous perennial with a compact growth habit and is native to the mountainous regions of Taiwan. The plant produces showy, spurred orchid flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a distinctive yellow or green lip. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in horticultural collections."
