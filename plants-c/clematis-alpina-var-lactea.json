    "intro": "Clematis alpina var. lactea, commonly known as the alpine clematis, is a perennial vine native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are compound, typically with three to five oval-shaped leaflets, and it is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
