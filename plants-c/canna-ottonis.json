    "intro": "Canna ottonis, commonly known as the Mexican canna, is a striking tropical plant native to Central America. It features large, broad leaves that are typically green with a silvery underside, and it produces showy, red-orange flower spikes that bloom in summer. The plant is a herbaceous perennial, often reaching heights of up to six feet. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees."
