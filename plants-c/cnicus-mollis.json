    "intro": "Cnicus mollis, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed habitats. Cnicus mollis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
