    "intro": "Centaurea ovina subsp. gulissashvilii, commonly known as the Georgian bupleurum, is a flowering plant native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight hairy texture, contributing to its drought tolerance. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution."
