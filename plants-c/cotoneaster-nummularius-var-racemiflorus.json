    "intro": "Cotoneaster nummularius var. racemiflorus, commonly known as the racemiflorus cotoneaster, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to China. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its seasonal color changes. This variety is relatively low-maintenance and thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun."
