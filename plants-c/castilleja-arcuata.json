    "intro": "Castilleja arcuata, commonly known as the bentleaf milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reddish or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, often twisted stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine pubescence. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, forming dense colonies. Castilleja arcuata relies on a network of roots to absorb nutrients from its host plants, making it an important component of certain ecological systems."
