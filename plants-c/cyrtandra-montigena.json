    "intro": "Cyrtandra montigena, commonly known as the Hawaiian bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and stream banks. It has heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped blooms that attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Due to habitat loss, Cyrtandra montigena is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
