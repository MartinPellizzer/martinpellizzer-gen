    "intro": "Cyperus ferax subsp. engelmannii, commonly known as Engelmann's flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often surrounded by bracts. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in wetland environments. It is often found in association with other wetland plants and plays a role in maintaining ecological balance in its habitat."
