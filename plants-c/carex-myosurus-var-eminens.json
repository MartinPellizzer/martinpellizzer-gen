    "intro": "Carex myosurus var. eminens, commonly known as the tall sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flowering spikes that rise above narrow, grass-like leaves. This variety is native to Europe and is often found in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and woodland edges. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled, spike-like fruits. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wetland environments."
