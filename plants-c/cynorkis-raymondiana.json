    "intro": "Cynorkis raymondiana, commonly known as the Raymond's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or along riverbanks. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cynorkis raymondiana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
