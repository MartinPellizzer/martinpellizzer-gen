    "intro": "Crinum rigidum, commonly known as the rigid lily or swamp lily, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, showy white or pale pink flowers. The plant has strap-shaped, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It thrives in moist, swampy environments and is often found near water bodies. Crinum rigidum is a perennial herb that produces bulbous roots, which help it survive seasonal flooding."
