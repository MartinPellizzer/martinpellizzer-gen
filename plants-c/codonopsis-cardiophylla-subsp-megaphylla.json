    "intro": "Codonopsis cardiophylla subsp. megaphylla, commonly known as the giant codonopsis, is a rare and striking member of the Campanulaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, preferring cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
