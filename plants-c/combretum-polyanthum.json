    "intro": "Combretum polyanthum, commonly known as the flame tree or red flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that appear in clusters, often resembling flames, and its compound leaves that are opposite and pinnate. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain several seeds, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
