    "intro": "Coleosanthus congestus, commonly known as the dense cluster cycad, is a unique cycad species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a dense crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a role in local ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
