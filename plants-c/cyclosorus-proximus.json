    "intro": "Cyclosorus proximus, commonly known as the small water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are divided into small, clover-like lobes. The plant has no true roots and instead anchors itself with rhizomes, allowing it to spread across the water surface. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, producing tiny seeds that are dispersed by water currents. Cyclosorus proximus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
