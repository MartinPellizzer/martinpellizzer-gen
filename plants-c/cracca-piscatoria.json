    "intro": "Cracca piscatoria, commonly known as water cranesbill, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking pink or purple flowers with five petals, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found along pond edges and stream banks. Cracca piscatoria is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
