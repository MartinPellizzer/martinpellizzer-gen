It belongs to the family Urticaceae and is characterized by its hairy, serrated leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant contains stinging hairs that release irritants when touched, causing a skin reaction in many people. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas.
