    "intro": "Carex boecheriana, commonly known as the Boecher's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. This plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower spikes during the summer months. The plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
