    "intro": "Cordia lasseri, commonly known as the desert cordia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries that are edible for some animals. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Cordia lasseri is well adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making it an important species in desert ecosystems."
