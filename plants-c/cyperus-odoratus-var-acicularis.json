    "intro": "Cyperus odoratus var. acicularis, commonly known as the spike rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in wet or marshy environments, often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it a common aquatic or semi-aquatic species. The plant's botanical structure is adapted for water retention and efficient photosynthesis in humid conditions."
