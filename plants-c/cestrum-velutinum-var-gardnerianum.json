It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and nocturnal fragrance. This variety is closely related to other cestrum species and shares similar growth habits and care requirements."
