    "intro": "Chamaefilix blepharodes var. vespertina, commonly known as the evening saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the late afternoon, giving it its common name. The plant has a rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
