It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are deeply lobed and often appear fern-like, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and arranged in racemes, typical of the Brassicaceae family. Cardamine dissecta is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
