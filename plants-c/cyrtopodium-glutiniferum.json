    "intro": "Cyrtopodium glutiniferum, commonly known as the sticky root orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with broad, leathery leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance, which may aid in water retention. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with long, narrow petals and a distinctive, narrow lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Due to its unique appearance and growth habits, it is a popular choice for collectors and enthusiasts of orchids."
