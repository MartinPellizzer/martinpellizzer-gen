    "intro": "Castilleja hispida subsp. acuta, commonly known as the hairy leaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant found in the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers, which are often mistaken for those of other species. Its leaves are hairy and narrow, and it typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Castilleja hispida subsp. acuta plays a role in supporting pollinators and is an important component of its native ecosystem."
