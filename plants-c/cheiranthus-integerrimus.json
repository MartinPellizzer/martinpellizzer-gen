    "intro": "Cheiranthus integerrimus, commonly known as the rock wallflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, gray-green leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a drought-tolerant plant."
