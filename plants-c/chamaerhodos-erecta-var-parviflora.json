    "intro": "Chamaerhodos erecta var. parviflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved redroot, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features upright, branching stems that are covered in dense, dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered red flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically less than an inch in diameter. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
