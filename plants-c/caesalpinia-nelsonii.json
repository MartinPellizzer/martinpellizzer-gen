    "intro": "Caesalpinia nelsonii, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange floral bracts that resemble flames, which appear in clusters at the ends of its branches. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments. Caesalpinia nelsonii thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
