    "intro": "Crocodilium galactites, commonly known as the golden crocodile plant, is a striking member of the Acanthaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Its unique, claw-like bracts give it the common name \"crocodile,\" while its flowers are often clustered in terminal inflorescences. Crocodilium galactites is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional medicine in some African cultures."
