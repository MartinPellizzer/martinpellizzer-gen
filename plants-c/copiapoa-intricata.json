    "intro": "Copiapoa intricata, commonly known as the \"Cerro de los Corrales\" cactus, is a species native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive rib structure and a gray-green coloration. The plant produces white to yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its spines are short and often white, providing some camouflage in its arid habitat. Copiapoa intricata is adapted to extreme drought conditions, storing water in its thick stem for survival."
