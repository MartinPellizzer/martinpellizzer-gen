    "intro": "Cyclosorus aquatilis, commonly known as the water clover, is a species of aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its delicate, branching fronds that resemble the leaves of clover, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes anchor it to the substrate, while its floating fronds help in photosynthesis. Cyclosorus aquatilis plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
