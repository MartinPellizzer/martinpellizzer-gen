    "intro": "Cerastium lacaitae, commonly known as the Sierra madre snowplant, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Madre mountains in Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cerastium lacaitae is considered a rare and endangered species."
