    "intro": "Cyrtandra \u00d7 alnea, commonly known as the hybrid Cyrtandra, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family, native to tropical regions of the Pacific. It is a flowering plant characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often with fleshy, thick leaves that help it retain moisture in its native habitat. Cyrtandra \u00d7 alnea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, moist environments. Its hybrid origin suggests it results from crosses between species within the Cyrtandra genus."
