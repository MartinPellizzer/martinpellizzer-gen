    "intro": "Calicotome villosa var. rigida, commonly known as the rigid hairy calicotome, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its grayish, hairy stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rocky or sandy habitats. The rigid varietal form is distinguished by its more upright growth habit compared to other varieties of Calicotome villosa."
