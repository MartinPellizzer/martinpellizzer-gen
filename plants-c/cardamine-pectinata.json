    "intro": "Cardamine pectinata, commonly known as the veined watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It features a rosette of trifoliate leaves with a distinctive veined pattern, and its stems are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by kidney-shaped seed pods. It thrives in cool, damp conditions and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
