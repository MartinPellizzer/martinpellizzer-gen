It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular red or orange flowers that attract hummingbirds. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy texture, while its stems are often trailing or cascading. Columnea boliviana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in hanging baskets."
