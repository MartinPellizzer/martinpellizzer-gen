    "intro": "Clerodendrum hildebrandtii var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy clerodendrum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, showy bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, often in shades of red, pink, or white. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The hairy pubescens variety is distinguished by its fine, fuzzy covering on the stems and leaves."
