    "intro": "Cyclosorus cataractorum, commonly known as the water fern, is a member of the water fern family, native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that often form dense mats on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater bodies. The plant has a complex life cycle involving both sexual and asexual reproduction, with spores playing a key role in its propagation. Its rhizomes are anchored to the substrate, allowing it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. Cyclosorus cataractorum is often used in aquatic gardens and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological benefits."
