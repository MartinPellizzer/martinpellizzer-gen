    "intro": "Carex lobulirostris, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its small, clustered flowers are usually green or brown, and it produces small, three-angled berries. Carex lobulirostris is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
