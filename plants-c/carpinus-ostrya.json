    "intro": "Carpinus ostrya, commonly known as the European hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its dense, almost smooth bark and oval-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by small, winged fruits called samaras. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along riverbanks. Carpinus ostrya is valued for its hard, durable wood and its ability to tolerate urban environments."
