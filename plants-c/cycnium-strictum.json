    "intro": "Cycnium strictum, commonly known as the common hogweed, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish hue. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Cycnium strictum is known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and photosensitivity."
