    "intro": "Crataegus valens, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries known as haws, which are edible but often used in jams and wines. Crataegus valens is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential cardiovascular benefits."
