    "intro": "Crataegus dumetosa, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red berries known as haws, which are edible but often used in jams and wines. Crataegus dumetosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential cardiovascular benefits."
