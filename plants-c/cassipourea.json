    "intro": "Cassipourea, commonly known as the \"cottonwood tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are typically small to medium-sized trees or shrubs, characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, often pink or white flowers. Cassipourea species produce capsules as fruits, which contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
