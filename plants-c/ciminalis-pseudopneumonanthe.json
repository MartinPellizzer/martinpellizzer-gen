    "intro": "Ciminalis pseudopneumonanthe, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its long, slender stems and striking, pale green or white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air and rain for sustenance. Its unique morphology and habitat make it highly sensitive to environmental changes, contributing to its endangered status. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is a subject of significant botanical interest and conservation efforts."
