It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a red or purple calyx. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
