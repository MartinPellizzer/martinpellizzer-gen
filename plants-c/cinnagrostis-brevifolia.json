    "intro": "Cinnagrostis brevifolia, commonly known as the shortleaf cinnagrostis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of North America. It features slender, erect stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, grass-like texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow to greenish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
