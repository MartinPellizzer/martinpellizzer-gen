    "intro": "Cogswellia simplex, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, leafless stems and striking, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It relies on specific pollinators, such as certain species of beetles, for reproduction. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, Cogswellia simplex is classified as critically endangered."
