    "intro": "Campanula rapunculus var. verruculosa, commonly known as the wooly bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and eastern Europe. It features hairy, often glandular stems and leaves, which give it its characteristic \"woolly\" appearance. The plant produces bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowers."
