    "intro": "Carex karoi var. parvirostris, commonly known as the narrow-beak sedge, is a perennial plant native to parts of East Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. Its small, clustered flowers are usually greenish or brownish, and it produces small, three-angled berries. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves and shorter, more compact inflorescence compared to other Carex species."
