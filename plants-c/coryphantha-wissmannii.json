    "intro": "Coryphantha wissmannii, commonly known as the Wissmann's pincushion cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a low-growing, spiny cactus with a compact, globular shape and dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it produces small, edible fruits that are often consumed by wildlife. Coryphantha wissmannii is well adapted to desert environments and is often found in rocky soils."
