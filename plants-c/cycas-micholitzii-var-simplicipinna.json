    "intro": "Cycas micholitzii var. simplicipinna, commonly known as the simple-pinnate cycad, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The leaves are typically dark green and have a smooth, waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its tropical habitat. This variety is notable for its relatively simple leaf structure compared to other cycad species. It is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal care once established."
