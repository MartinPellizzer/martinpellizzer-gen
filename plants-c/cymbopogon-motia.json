    "intro": "Cymbopogon motia, commonly known as lemongrass, is a tropical perennial grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, aromatic stalks that emit a strong lemon scent due to the presence of citral and other essential oils. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense clumps. The flowering stems are often used in culinary and medicinal applications, making it a valuable plant in various cultures."
