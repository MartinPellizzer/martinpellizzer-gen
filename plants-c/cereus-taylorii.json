    "intro": "Cereus taylorii, commonly known as the Taylor's night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and spiny, rib-like structure, which helps it store water and reduce water loss. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, and the flowers emit a sweet fragrance. Cereus taylorii is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
