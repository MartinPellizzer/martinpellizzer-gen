    "intro": "Cerasus triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in clusters of three, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar to cherries but are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are ovate with a smooth texture and a slightly serrated edge. Cerasus triflora is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been cultivated for both its flowers and fruits in various regions."
