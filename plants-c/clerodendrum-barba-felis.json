It is characterized by its striking, elongated, hair-like inflorescences that resemble a cat's whiskers, hence its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly rough texture."
