    "intro": "Coleus scutellarioides var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender leaf coleus, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and purple. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale purple or white, arranged in spikes at the tips of the stems. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental foliage rather than its flowers. This variety is popular in gardens and as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
