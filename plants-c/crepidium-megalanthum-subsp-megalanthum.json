    "intro": "Crepidium megalanthum subsp. megalanthum, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 cm in diameter. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers are usually pale yellow to orange, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects."
