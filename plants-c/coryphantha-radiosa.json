    "intro": "Coryphantha radiosa, commonly known as the radiate coryphantha, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cactaceae. It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its globular stem and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Coryphantha radiosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
