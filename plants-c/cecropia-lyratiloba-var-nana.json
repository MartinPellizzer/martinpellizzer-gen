    "intro": "Cecropia lyratiloba var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf Cecropia, is a small shrub or tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Urticaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, round fruits that contain a single seed. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its compact size and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
