    "intro": "Chloris villosa, commonly known as hairy grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
