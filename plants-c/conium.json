    "intro": "Conium, commonly known as hemlock, is a poisonous plant belonging to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in umbrella-shaped clusters. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, particularly coniine, which can cause paralysis and death in animals and humans. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodland edges and stream banks. Due to its extreme toxicity, it is important to avoid ingestion or contact with this plant."
