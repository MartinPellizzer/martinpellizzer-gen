    "intro": "Chamaecrista dentata, commonly known as the hairy pod senna, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with serrated margins and yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces long, slender pods that are covered in fine hairs, which give it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides. Chamaecrista dentata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
