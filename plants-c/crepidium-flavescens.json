    "intro": "Crepidium flavescens, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and green. The plant prefers humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding substrate, and it has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. The flowers are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
