    "intro": "Cranichis parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are grass-like and arranged in a rosette, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Cranichis parviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
