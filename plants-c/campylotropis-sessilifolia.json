    "intro": "Campylotropis sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaved bellflower, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with stipules and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in forest edges and rocky habitats, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in both horticulture and ecological research."
