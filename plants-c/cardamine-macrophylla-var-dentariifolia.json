    "intro": "Cardamine macrophylla var. dentariifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf watercress, is a herbaceous perennial native to moist, shady environments in North America. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a waxy coating, and its stems are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils. The plant is valued for its peppery flavor and is sometimes used in salads or as a garnish."
