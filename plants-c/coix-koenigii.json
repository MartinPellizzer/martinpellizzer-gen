It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, dark-colored grains. The plant is often cultivated for its edible grains, which are rich in nutrients and have a nutty flavor. Coix koenigii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
