    "intro": "Cyclocodon, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. Cyclocodon species typically have succulent leaves and stems, which help them survive in their native arid environments. They are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements. The genus includes several species, such as Cyclocodon cymosus and Cyclocodon grandiflorus, which are popular in horticulture."
