    "intro": "Cleome grandifolia, commonly known as the Mexican marvel or spider flower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, pink to purple flower heads that resemble spider-like blooms. The plant produces small, green, egg-shaped fruits that split open to release seeds. Cleome grandifolia thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in gardens. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
