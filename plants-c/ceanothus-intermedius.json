It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Ceanothus intermedius is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in dry, sunny conditions."
