    "intro": "Calamagrostis tripilifera, commonly known as the three-ribbed reed, is a tall perennial grass native to parts of Asia and Europe. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, meadows, and riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers in late summer. Its botanical features include three distinct ribs on the leaf blades, which give it its common name. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
