It is native to the rainforests of Central and West Africa, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are broad and velvety, while its fruits are fleshy berries that turn red when ripe. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
