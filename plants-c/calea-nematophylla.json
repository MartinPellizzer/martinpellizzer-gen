    "intro": "Calea nematophylla, commonly known as the \"Moonflower of the Andes,\" is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, white, star-shaped flowers that open at night, releasing a strong, sweet fragrance. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in cool, humid conditions and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular subject in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
