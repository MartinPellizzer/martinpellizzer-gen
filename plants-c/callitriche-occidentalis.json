    "intro": "Callitriche occidentalis, commonly known as western water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wetlands. The plant has whorled leaves that are often submerged, with small, star-shaped flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its reproductive strategy involves both sexual reproduction through seeds and vegetative propagation via runners. Callitriche occidentalis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
