    "intro": "Colona lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf colona, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of South America. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshy or swampy habitats. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in wet garden environments for its ornamental value."
