    "intro": "Chironia linoides subsp. nana, commonly known as the dwarf chironia, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of no more than 10 centimeters, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting. Due to its modest size and ornamental value, it is a favored choice for gardeners looking to add texture and color to smaller spaces."
