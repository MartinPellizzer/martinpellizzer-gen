    "intro": "Crataegus torminalis, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries that ripen in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Crataegus torminalis is often found in woodlands, hedgerows, and along stream banks, thriving in a variety of soil types. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
