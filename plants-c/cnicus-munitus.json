    "intro": "Cnicus munitus, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a low-growing flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and melons, though it is not closely related to them. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals and is often found in dry, sandy soils. Its fruit is a small, green, fleshy berry that turns red when mature. Cnicus munitus is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
