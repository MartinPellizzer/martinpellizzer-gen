It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often covered in a rusty-brown pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, spiny flower spikes that typically bloom in spring, adding dramatic visual interest. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a valuable addition to both ornamental and ecological gardens."
