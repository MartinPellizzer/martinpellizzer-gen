    "intro": "Clermontia multiflora, commonly known as the Hawaiian flax, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and along stream banks. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom throughout the year. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Clermontia multiflora is considered a rare and endangered species."
