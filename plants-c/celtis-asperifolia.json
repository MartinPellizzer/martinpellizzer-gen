    "intro": "Celtis asperifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern and central United States. It belongs to the Cannabaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, elliptical leaves with a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, orange-red berries that attract birds and other wildlife. Celtis asperifolia is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its adaptability and ecological importance make it a valuable component of native plant communities."
