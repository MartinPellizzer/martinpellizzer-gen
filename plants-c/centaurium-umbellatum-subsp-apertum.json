    "intro": "Centaurium umbellatum subsp. apertum, commonly known as the open-centred whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in meadows and grasslands. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in an umbel, which gives it its species name. Its leaves are linear and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are erect and slender. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its use in traditional herbal medicine."
