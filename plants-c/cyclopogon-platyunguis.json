    "intro": "Cyclopogon platyunguis, commonly known as the flat-leaved cyclopogon, is a rare grass-like plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, flat leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclopogon platyunguis is considered a species of conservation concern."
