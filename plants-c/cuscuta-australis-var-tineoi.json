    "intro": "Cuscuta australis var. tineoi, commonly known as the Australian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host to extract water and nutrients. The plant is native to Australia and thrives in warm, dry climates. It is often found growing on shrubs and trees in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural and ornamental plants."
