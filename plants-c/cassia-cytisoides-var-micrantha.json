    "intro": "Cassia cytisoides var. micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered cassia, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated, flat pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to a variety of tropical and subtropical environments. Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in landscaping and soil improvement."
