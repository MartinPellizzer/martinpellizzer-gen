    "intro": "Cyperus trinervis var. breviculmis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and is characterized by its triangular stems and small, three-ranked leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are usually wind-pollinated. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
