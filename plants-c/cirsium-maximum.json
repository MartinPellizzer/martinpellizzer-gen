    "intro": "Cirsium maximum, commonly known as the greater thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with a robust stem covered in coarse hairs. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are arranged in a spherical shape, making it a distinctive and showy plant in its native habitat."
