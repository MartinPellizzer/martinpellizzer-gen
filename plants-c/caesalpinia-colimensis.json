    "intro": "Caesalpinia colimensis, commonly known as the flame tree or fire tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its bright red or orange inflorescences, which resemble flames, and its bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small leaflets. The plant produces elongated, woody pods that contain several seeds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Caesalpinia colimensis thrives in warm, humid climates and is adapted to full sun exposure. Its rapid growth rate and ability to fix nitrogen make it useful in soil rehabilitation and reforestation projects."
