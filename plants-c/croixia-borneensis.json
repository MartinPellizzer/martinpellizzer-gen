    "intro": "Croixia borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean croixia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant grows as a herbaceous perennial, often found in shaded, moist environments within the forest understory. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Croixia borneensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
