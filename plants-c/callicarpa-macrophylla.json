    "intro": "Callicarpa macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue berries that are highly attractive to birds. These berries are edible for humans but are often considered toxic in large quantities. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens."
