    "intro": "Crataegus cordato, commonly known as the heart-leaved hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its simple, ovate to cordate (heart-shaped) leaves that are usually 2\u20136 inches long. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Crataegus cordato is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and open areas with well-drained soil. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential cardiovascular benefits."
