    "intro": "Campanula sessilis, commonly known as the sessile bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped, sessile leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Campanula sessilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
