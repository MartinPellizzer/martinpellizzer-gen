    "intro": "Canavalia lanaiensis, commonly known as Lanai morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a vigorous vine that produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces elongated, bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing along coastal areas and in disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
