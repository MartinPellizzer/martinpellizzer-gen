    "intro": "Celtis berteroana, commonly known as the velvetleaf hackberry, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-9 inches long. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by small, spherical fruits that are edible for some animals but not generally considered palatable by humans. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in arid and semi-arid environments. Celtis berteroana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat and food for wildlife."
