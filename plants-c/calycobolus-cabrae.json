    "intro": "Calycobolus cabrae, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a rare and exotic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, horn-like floral structures that resemble miniature horns, giving it its common name. The plant produces vibrant purple and violet flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically between late autumn and early spring. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to minimize water loss in its arid environment. Calycobolus cabrae is known for its unique pollination mechanism, relying on specific species of bees that are attracted to its nectar-rich blossoms."
