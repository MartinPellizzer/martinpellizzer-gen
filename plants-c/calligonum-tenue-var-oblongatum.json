    "intro": "Calligonum tenue var. oblongatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf jointvetch, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems with small, oblong leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes."
