It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, typically bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and seasonally flooded areas, and is often found in disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a useful indicator plant for aquatic habitats."
