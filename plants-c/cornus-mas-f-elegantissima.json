    "intro": "Cornus mas f. elegantissima, commonly known as the White Dogwood or Cornus mas, is a decorative shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its showy white bracts that appear in late spring, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, red drupes in the fall, adding visual interest to the landscape. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a versatile choice for gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes."
