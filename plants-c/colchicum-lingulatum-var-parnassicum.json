    "intro": "Colchicum lingulatum var. parnassicum, commonly known as the Parnassian colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late summer. The plant features broad, waxy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
