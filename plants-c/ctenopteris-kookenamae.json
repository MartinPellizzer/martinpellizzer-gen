    "intro": "Ctenopteris kookenamae, commonly known as the Kooken's sea holly, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Ctenopteris kookenamae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
