    "intro": "Clematis ovatifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf clematis, is a climbing vine native to parts of Asia and Australia. It features heart-shaped, ovate leaves that are typically green and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its stems are slender and twining, allowing it to climb supports such as trellises or fences. Clematis ovatifolia thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens."
