    "intro": "Cyathea mastersiana, commonly known as the masters' tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in persistent, fibrous roots. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, contributing to its dramatic appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, adding a unique visual element to its natural habitat."
