    "intro": "Cypripedium socco, commonly known as the Socco lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically pink or red with contrasting yellow markings. The plant has a thick, fleshy rhizome and produces leaves that are broad and strap-like, adapted to its cool, humid habitat. It blooms in late spring or early summer, and its flowers are pollinated primarily by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
