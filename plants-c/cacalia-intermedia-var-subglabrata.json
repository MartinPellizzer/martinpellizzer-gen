    "intro": "Cacalia intermedia var. subglabrata, commonly known as the slender blueweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy, though the variety subglabrata is less so, giving it a smoother appearance. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders."
