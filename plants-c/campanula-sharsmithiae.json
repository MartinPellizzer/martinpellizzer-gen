    "intro": "Campanula sharsmithiae, commonly known as Sharsmith's bellflower, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the high mountain regions of Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family, characterized by its bell-shaped flowers and showy blooms. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its flowers are usually blue or violet, with five lobes, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
