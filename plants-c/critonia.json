The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found growing in shaded, rocky crevices. Its unique appearance and elusive nature have made it a subject of fascination among botanists and plant enthusiasts. Due to its delicate ecosystem requirements, Critonia is considered endangered and is protected in its natural habitat."
