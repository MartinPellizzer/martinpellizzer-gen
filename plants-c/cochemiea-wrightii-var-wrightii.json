    "intro": "Cochemiea wrightii var. wrightii, commonly known as the Wright's cochemiea, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless plant with a compact, globular shape and a dense covering of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it an attractive and hardy addition to arid landscapes."
