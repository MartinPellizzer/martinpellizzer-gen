    "intro": "Chorizanthe robusta var. hartwegii, commonly known as Hartweg's robust choris, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically borne in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The leaves are generally lance-shaped and may have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations."
