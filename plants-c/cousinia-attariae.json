    "intro": "Cousinia attariae, commonly known as the Kashmiri cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit, with numerous small, clustered flowering heads. The plant produces yellow to orange composite flowers, which are surrounded by pale green bracts. Its leaves are typically narrow, grass-like, and arranged in a rosette pattern to conserve moisture in its arid environment. Cousinia attariae is well adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
