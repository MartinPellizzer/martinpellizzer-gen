    "intro": "Cremanthodium retusum, commonly known as the rough cremanthodium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, sunny conditions. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in a head, and the leaves are usually covered in a fine layer of hairs. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
