    "intro": "Cyphonanthus, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Solanaceae family. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Cyphonanthus species are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. They typically have small, hairy leaves and produce berries that are toxic to humans but may be consumed by certain wildlife. The genus is noted for its adaptability to harsh desert conditions and its role in local ecosystems."
