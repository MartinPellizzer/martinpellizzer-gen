    "intro": "Cercodia racemosa, commonly known as the clustered broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which are often inconspicuous. Its root system consists of haustoria, specialized structures that penetrate the roots of host plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, influencing the growth and distribution of its host species."
