It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to arid and semi-arid environments. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant's resilience and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
