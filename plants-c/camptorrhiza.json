    "intro": "Camptorrhiza, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a flowering plant in the Amaryllis family, characterized by its slender, curling stems and striking, violet-colored flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in rocky, arid environments, making it well-adapted to desert conditions. Its flowers bloom in late spring and early summer, often appearing as if they are floating in the air due to the way the stems curve. Camptorrhiza is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used by indigenous peoples for various healing purposes."
