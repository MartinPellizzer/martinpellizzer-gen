    "intro": "Carex bipartita var. amphigena, commonly known as the western marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The leaves are usually narrow and slightly curved, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss."
