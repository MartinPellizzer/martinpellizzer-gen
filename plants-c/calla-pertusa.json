    "intro": "Calla pertusa, commonly known as the creeping calla, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Araceae family, which is characterized by its unique inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant produces striking white or cream-colored spathe that resembles a calla lily, though it is not closely related to the true calla lilies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Calla pertusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
