    "intro": "Crepidiastrum lanceolatum var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf horse chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces showy white or pink flowers in spring, followed by spiny, capsule-like fruits that contain shiny, chestnut-like seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is commonly planted in gardens and parks."
