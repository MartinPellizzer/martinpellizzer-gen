    "intro": "Cochleariella warburgii, commonly known as the Warburg's cochleariella, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its leathery, crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to rock surfaces, typically in arid or semi-arid environments. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic alga and a fungus, with the alga providing nutrients through photosynthesis and the fungus offering structural support and protection. It is often found in regions with low humidity and high sunlight exposure, such as deserts and rocky outcrops. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of environmental conditions."
