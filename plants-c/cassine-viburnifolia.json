    "intro": "Cassine viburnifolia, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to wetland and swampy environments. Cassine viburnifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
