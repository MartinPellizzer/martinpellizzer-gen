    "intro": "Cyperus unifolius, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and distinctive, umbrella-shaped inflorescence. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands. Cyperus unifolius is often used in ornamental gardening and can also serve as a habitat for various aquatic organisms."
