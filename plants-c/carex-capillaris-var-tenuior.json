    "intro": "Carex capillaris var. tenuior, commonly known as slender hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in width, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in areas with standing water or high humidity. Its fine, grass-like texture and ability to stabilize soil make it a valuable plant in wetland restoration projects."
