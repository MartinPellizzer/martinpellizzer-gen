    "intro": "Cyclosorus tibeticus, commonly known as the Tibetan cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It thrives in cold, oligotrophic lakes and streams, where it forms dense underwater colonies. The plant's fronds are narrow and ribbon-like, with a distinct, spirally arranged pattern of leaves. It plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic organisms. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
