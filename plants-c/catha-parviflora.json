It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds, though it is not closely related to them. The plant is characterized by its small, green, heart-shaped leaves and yellowish-white flowers. It produces small, round fruits that mature to a dark green color. Catha parviflora is known for containing cathinone and cathine, which are stimulant compounds used traditionally in social and cultural contexts."
