    "intro": "Cimicifuga europaea, commonly known as black cohosh, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a tall, unbranched stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height, bearing large, compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late summer, which are followed by bright red berries. Its roots and rhizomes are the primary parts used in traditional medicine. Cimicifuga europaea is known for its medicinal properties, particularly in treating menopausal symptoms and menstrual disorders."
