It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub with upright stems and broad, waxy leaves. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
