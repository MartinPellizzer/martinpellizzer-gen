It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, rusty-colored pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically arranged in a raceme. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Cyrtochilum ferrugineum is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
