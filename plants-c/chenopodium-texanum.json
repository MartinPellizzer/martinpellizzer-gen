    "intro": "Chenopodium texanum, commonly known as Texas goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is an annual herb that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. The plant has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its seeds are encased in a dry, three-lobed capsule, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in arid conditions. Chenopodium texanum is also sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
