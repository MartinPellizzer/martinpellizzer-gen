    "intro": "Calamagrostis arenaria subsp. arenaria, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to sandy and coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance, especially in full sun. The plant produces tall, slender inflorescences with small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate coastal conditions. This subspecies is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for wildlife."
