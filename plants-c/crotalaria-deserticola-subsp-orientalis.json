It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species characterized by its erect stems and alternate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces yellow, spurred flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typical of the Crotalaria genus. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
