    "intro": "Coffea myrtifolia, commonly known as the myrtle-leaved coffee. It is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family, native to tropical regions of Africa and the Middle East. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive myrtle-like scent. It produces small, white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries containing the seeds used for coffee. Despite its potential, it is less commonly cultivated than other coffee species due to its lower yield and specific growing requirements."
