It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, often clustered flowers and elliptical leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has a woody stem with a rough, fissured surface. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Cryptolepis pauciflora is also noted for its medicinal properties, used traditionally in some African communities for various health purposes."
