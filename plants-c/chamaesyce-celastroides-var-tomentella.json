    "intro": "Chamaesyce celastroides var. tomentella, commonly known as the woolly groundsel, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of stems. The plant has hairy, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed areas. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to coastal and inland habitats with full sun exposure."
