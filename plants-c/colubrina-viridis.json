    "intro": "Colubrina viridis, commonly known as green colubrina, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and in wetlands. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are usually white or pale blue, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or water."
