    "intro": "Chaptalia transiliens, commonly known as the mountain chaptalia, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The flowers bloom in late summer, producing small yellow petals that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
