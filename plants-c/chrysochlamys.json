    "intro": "Chrysochlamys, commonly known as the golden flame tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to parts of Australia and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The leaves are typically bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments. Chrysochlamys species are often found in dry, open habitats and are adapted to thrive in arid conditions. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in horticulture for their vibrant floral displays."
