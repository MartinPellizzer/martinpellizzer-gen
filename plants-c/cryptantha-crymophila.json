    "intro": "Cryptantha crymophila, commonly known as the Sierra cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in mountainous regions, often in open habitats. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
