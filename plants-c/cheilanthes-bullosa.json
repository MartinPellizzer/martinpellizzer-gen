    "intro": "Cheilanthes bullosa, commonly known as the bubble bladder fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its distinctive, inflated, bubble-like spore cases on the underside of its fronds. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is often found in crevices or on slopes where it can retain moisture. Its spores are released when the blisters rupture, facilitating wind dispersal. Cheilanthes bullosa is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
