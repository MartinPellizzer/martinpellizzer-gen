    "intro": "Celastrus hypoleucus f. puberulus, commonly known as the pubescent bindweed, is a variant of the common bindweed, characterized by its pubescent (hairy) foliage. It is a climbing vine native to North America, typically found in moist, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and woodland edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, facilitating its spread. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
