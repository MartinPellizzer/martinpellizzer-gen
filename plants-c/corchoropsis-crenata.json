    "intro": "Corchoropsis crenata, commonly known as the coastal cotton or sea cotton, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a waxy coating. It is known for its fibrous bark, which has been used traditionally for making ropes and textiles. The species is also valued for its ability to stabilize coastal dunes and prevent erosion."
