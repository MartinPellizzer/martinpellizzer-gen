    "intro": "Carduus hybridus, commonly known as the common cocklebur, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and large, yellowish-green flower heads that resemble a bur. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a prickly husk, aiding in its spread. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Botanically, it is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and thistles."
