    "intro": "Cyperorchis mastersii, commonly known as the masters' sedge orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique combination of grass-like foliage and showy orchid flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic soils in swampy or marshy habitats, often near water bodies. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are usually pale green or yellow with intricate patterns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
