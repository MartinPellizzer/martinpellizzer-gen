    "intro": "Chionogentias tereticaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved snowbell, is a perennial herb native to the high elevations of the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a frosty appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
