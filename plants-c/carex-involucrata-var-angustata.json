    "intro": "Carex involucrata var. angustata, commonly known as narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial sedge native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 1 mm wide, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces dense spikes of small, spikelet-like flowers that are usually green to brown in color. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
