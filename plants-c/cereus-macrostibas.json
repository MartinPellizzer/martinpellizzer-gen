    "intro": "Cereus macrostibas, commonly known as the giant night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white and yellow. These flowers emit a strong fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. The plant is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick, fleshy stems."
