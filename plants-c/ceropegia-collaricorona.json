It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, with intricate patterns resembling lace. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
