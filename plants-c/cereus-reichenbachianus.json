    "intro": "Cereus reichenbachianus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and spiny ridges. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its flowers typically bloom only once a year, making it a rare and striking sight. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, with thick stems that store water and reduce transpiration."
