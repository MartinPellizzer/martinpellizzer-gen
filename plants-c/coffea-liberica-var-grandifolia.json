    "intro": "Coffea liberica var. grandifolia, commonly known as the African coffee. It is a variant of the Liberica species, characterized by its large, elongated leaves and relatively large, showy flowers. This plant is native to West Africa and thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and ample rainfall. Its fruit, known as a coffee cherry, contains the seeds used to produce coffee beans. While less commonly cultivated than Arabica or Robusta, it is valued for its unique flavor profile and historical significance in coffee production."
