    "intro": "Cuscuta xanthochortos var. longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that coil around its host. The plant is characterized by its long, narrow bracts that are often mistaken for leaves. It is typically found in arid or semi-arid regions where it attaches to various host species. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants."
