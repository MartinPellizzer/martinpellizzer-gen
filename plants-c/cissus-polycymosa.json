    "intro": "Cissus polycymosa, commonly known as the climbing fig-leaf vine, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its vigorous climbing habit and large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are often consumed by wildlife. Its stems are woody and can develop aerial roots, allowing it to attach to surfaces as it grows. Cissus polycymosa is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in humid environments."
