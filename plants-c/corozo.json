    "intro": "Corozo, commonly known as palm wood, is a type of hardwood derived from the inner core of certain palm trees, primarily the *Euterpe* genus. It is characterized by its dense, fine-grained texture and high durability, making it suitable for carving and crafting. The wood is often used to make items such as combs, jewelry, and religious artifacts due to its smoothness and workability. It grows in tropical regions, particularly in South America, where it is harvested sustainably in some areas. The botanical classification of corozo places it within the Arecaceae family, highlighting its relation to other palms."
