    "intro": "Calamagrostis varia var. subbiflora, commonly known as the slender marsh reed, is a grass species native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically pale green to reddish in color. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland restoration projects."
