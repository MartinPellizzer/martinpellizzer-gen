    "intro": "Croton spectabilis, commonly known as the red-leaf croton, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, colorful foliage, which can range from bright red to orange and yellow. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
