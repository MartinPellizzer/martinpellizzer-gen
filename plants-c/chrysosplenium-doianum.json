    "intro": "Chrysosplenium doianum, commonly known as the Doian's golden spleenwort, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Saxifragaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, basal rosette of narrowly elliptical, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are clustered in cymes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Chrysosplenium doianum is native to parts of Europe and is often found in rocky or humus-rich soils."
