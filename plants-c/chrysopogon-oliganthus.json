    "intro": "Chrysopogon oliganthus, commonly known as silver grass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray blades and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, pale green or brown spikelets that are clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements, it is often used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
