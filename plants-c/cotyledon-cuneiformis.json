    "intro": "Cotyledon cuneiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, narrow, wedge-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Cotyledon cuneiformis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and resilience."
