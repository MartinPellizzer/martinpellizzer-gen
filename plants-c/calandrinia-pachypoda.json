    "intro": "Calandrinia pachypoda, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual with hairy, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces vibrant purple or blue flowers that open in the morning and close by midday. Its succulent leaves and stems store moisture, allowing it to thrive in hot, dry environments. Calandrinia pachypoda is often found in sandy or rocky soils along desert margins and is a common sight in disturbed areas."
