    "intro": "Cyathea bellisquamata var. ambrensis, commonly known as the Ambrense tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical rainforests. Its fronds are covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures that provide a unique texture and aid in moisture retention. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a decorative plant in tropical landscapes."
