    "intro": "Cardamine reptans, commonly known as the creeping watercress, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, alternate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself in damp soil while absorbing nutrients efficiently."
