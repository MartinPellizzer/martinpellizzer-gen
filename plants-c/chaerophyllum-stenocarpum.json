    "intro": "Chaerophyllum stenocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-fruit parsley, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
