    "intro": "Cerastium polymorphum var. myrtifolium, commonly known as the myrtle-leaved mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. The leaves are typically oval or lance-shaped, with a soft, velvety texture and a distinct reddish or purplish hue on the underside. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh, mountainous conditions."
