    "intro": "Corymbia ptychocarpa, commonly known as the red gum or red bloodwood, is a member of the Myrtaceae family and is native to northern Australia. It is a tall, deciduous tree that can grow up to 30 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in strips. The tree produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a rough, sometimes hairy texture. Corymbia ptychocarpa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and heat."
