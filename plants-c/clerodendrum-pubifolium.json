    "intro": "Clerodendrum pubifolium, commonly known as the hairy-leaved cleerodendrum, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, hairy, and often lobed leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color. These flowers are followed by small, orange-red berries that contain the seeds. Clerodendrum pubifolium is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
