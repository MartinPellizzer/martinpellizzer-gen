    "intro": "Cypripedium hookerae var. volonteanum, commonly known as the Volontean lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically pink or reddish in color. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces a single, upright stem that bears a single flower. Its leaves are broad and oval, arranged in a basal rosette, and it thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
