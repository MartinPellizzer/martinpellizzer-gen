    "intro": "Clematis comoresensis, commonly known as the Comoro clematis, is a flowering plant native to the Comoros archipelago in the Indian Ocean. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and showy, typically blue or violet flowers. The plant features compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Clematis comoresensis is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soils and partial to full sun. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
