    "intro": "Corymbia deserticola subsp. deserticola, commonly known as the Desert Mahogany, is a small to medium-sized tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that is often grey or reddish in color. The leaves are narrow, linear, and usually pubescent, adapting to the harsh, dry environments it inhabits. The tree produces small, clustered white or pink flowers, which are followed by woody, cylindrical fruits. It is well-suited to drought conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
