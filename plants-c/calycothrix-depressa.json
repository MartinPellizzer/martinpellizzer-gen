    "intro": "Calycothrix depressa, commonly known as the flat-leaved marsh plant, is a small, herbaceous species native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, with a short, creeping stem. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often resembling a head or cluster. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in its moist habitat. Calycothrix depressa is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in saturated soils."
