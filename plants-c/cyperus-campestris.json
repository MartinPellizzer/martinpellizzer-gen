    "intro": "Cyperus campestris, commonly known as the marsh grass or swamp spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, clustered flowers. This plant typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Cyperus campestris is adapted to tolerate saturated soils and has rhizomes that help it spread vegetatively. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
