    "intro": "Codonanthopsis calcarata, commonly known as the rock codonanthe, is a perennial evergreen plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit. The plant features narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
