    "intro": "Claoxylon grandifolium var. genuinum, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a large aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. The plant floats on the surface of freshwater bodies, with its roots submerged in the water. Its flowers are pale yellow and bloom during the wet season, attracting pollinators such as beetles. This species plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration."
