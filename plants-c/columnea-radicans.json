    "intro": "Columnea radicans, commonly known as the trailing columnea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant, tubular flowers. The plant produces showy, often brightly colored flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in bright, indirect light with moderate humidity. Columnea radicans is often cultivated as a houseplant or in hanging baskets due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
