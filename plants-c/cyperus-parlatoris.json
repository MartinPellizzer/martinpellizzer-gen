    "intro": "Cyperus parlatoris, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and distinctive umbrella-shaped inflorescence. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Cyperus parlatoris is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
