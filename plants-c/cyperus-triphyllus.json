Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes and wetlands. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an aggressive colonizer in suitable habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
