    "intro": "Cleistocactus samaipatanus subsp. divi-miseratus, commonly known as the \"sad devil\" cactus, is a rare and striking species native to Bolivia. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white to pale blue spines. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers that open only at night, a unique adaptation for pollination by nocturnal insects. It thrives in arid environments with well-drained soil and requires minimal water. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
