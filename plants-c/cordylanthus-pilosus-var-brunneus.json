    "intro": "Cordylanthus pilosus var. brunneus, commonly known as the brown-haired flaxvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often tinged with a reddish or brown hue. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its adaptability and nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
