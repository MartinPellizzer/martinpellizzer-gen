It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Calyptrostegia lanata is often found growing on rocky slopes or in dry grasslands, where it adapts well to poor soil conditions."
