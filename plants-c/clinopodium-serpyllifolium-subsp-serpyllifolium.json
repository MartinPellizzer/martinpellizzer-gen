    "intro": "Clinopodium serpyllifolium subsp. serpyllifolium, commonly known as creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, aromatic leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped and have a strong, mint-like aroma when crushed. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a common sight in meadows and along woodland edges."
