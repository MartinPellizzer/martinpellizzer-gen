    "intro": "Candollea davisii, commonly known as the Davis's candollea, is a rare and striking plant native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic plants that thrive in humid, tropical environments. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, colorful inflorescence that resembles a bottlebrush, often displaying shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a rosette pattern, forming a water-holding structure typical of bromeliads. Candollea davisii is notable for its ecological significance and is often found growing on trees in the understory of dense, misty forests."
