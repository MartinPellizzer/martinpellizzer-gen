    "intro": "Cyathea trichomanoides, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizome produces both roots and new shoots, allowing it to grow rapidly under suitable conditions. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
