    "intro": "Chusquea montana f. nigricans, commonly known as the black-stemmed dwarf bamboo, is a compact, clump-forming plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It features dark, almost black, culms that contrast with its bright green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale yellow to white flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in temperate climates."
