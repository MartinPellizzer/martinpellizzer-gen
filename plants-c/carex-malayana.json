It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, three-parted flowers, which are wind-pollinated.
