    "intro": "Carex disticha var. distachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. The plant features grass-like leaves that are narrow and slightly curved, with a distinctive blue-green coloration. Its inflorescence consists of two spikelets, one terminal and one lateral, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
