    "intro": "Cytisus capitatus var. pauciflorus, commonly known as the Spanish broom, is a shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces long, slender pods that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and rocky areas. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
