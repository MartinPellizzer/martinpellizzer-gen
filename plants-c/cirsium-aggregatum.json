    "intro": "Cirsium aggregatum, commonly known as the clustered thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its spiny, purple-blue flowers and a rosette of gray-green, fuzzy leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and sagebrush habitats. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers bloom in late summer and early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
