It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a distinctive central disk surrounded by ray florets. Cybianthus cuneifolius is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soils."
