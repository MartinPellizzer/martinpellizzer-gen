    "intro": "Cecropia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ceiba, is a fast-growing tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody fruits containing numerous seeds. Cecropia angustifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments within rainforests. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
