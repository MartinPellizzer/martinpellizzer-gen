It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, which are borne on leafless stems. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense mat, often found in moist, shaded environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
