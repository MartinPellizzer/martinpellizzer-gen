    "intro": "Camphora camphora, commonly known as the camphor tree, is a large evergreen tree native to southern Asia. It is characterized by its thick, aromatic bark and dark green, leathery leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing seeds. Its essential oil, derived from the bark and leaves, is widely used in traditional medicine and as a topical analgesic. The plant is also valued for its durable wood, which has been historically used in construction and craftsmanship."
