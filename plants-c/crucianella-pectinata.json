    "intro": "Crucianella pectinata, commonly known as the sea almond, is a small evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round, fleshy fruits that are typically red or orange when mature. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in coastal landscaping for erosion control."
