    "intro": "Cyclosorus subochthodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water clover, is a species of aquatic fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Cyclosorus subochthodes plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish."
