It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and is often found in marshes and swamps. The plant has long, narrow leaves that grow in clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Cladium glomeratum is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
