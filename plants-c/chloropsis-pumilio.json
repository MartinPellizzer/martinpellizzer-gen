    "intro": "Chloropsis pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf greenbul, is a small passerine bird native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its olive-green plumage and relatively short, rounded wings. The bird typically inhabits dense shrublands and woodlands, where it forages for insects and small invertebrates. Its vocalizations are often described as clear, whistled notes, and it is known for its shy and elusive nature. Despite its small size, the dwarf greenbul plays an important role in seed dispersal and insect control in its ecosystem."
