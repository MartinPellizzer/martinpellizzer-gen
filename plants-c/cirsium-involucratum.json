    "intro": "Cirsium involucratum, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and a purple to pinkish flower head that blooms in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. Its leaves are covered in dense, white hairs that give it a woolly appearance. The woolly thistle plays a role in supporting pollinators and is often found in disturbed or marginal soils."
