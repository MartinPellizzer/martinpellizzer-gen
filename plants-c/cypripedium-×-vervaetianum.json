    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 vervaetianum, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the forests of eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking yellow pouch-shaped lip, which is a key feature for attracting pollinators. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves and a single, showy flower that blooms in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rich, humusy soils. Due to its ornamental value and habitat sensitivity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
