    "intro": "Ceratocapnos umbrosa, commonly known as the dark alpine bellflower, is a rare and specialized plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often blooming in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
