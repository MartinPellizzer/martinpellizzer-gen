    "intro": "Cymbidium tentyozanense, commonly known as the Tentyozan orchid, is a rare and native species found primarily in Japan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
