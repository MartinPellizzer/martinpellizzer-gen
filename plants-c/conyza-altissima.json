The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. It produces small, yellow to white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Conyza altissima is known for its ability to spread rapidly and is sometimes considered a weed due to its invasive tendencies."
