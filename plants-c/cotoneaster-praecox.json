    "intro": "Cotoneaster praecox, commonly known as early cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern and central Europe. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring small, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. Its roots are fibrous and can spread extensively, making it a hardy plant adaptable to various soil types. Cotoneaster praecox is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moderate climates."
