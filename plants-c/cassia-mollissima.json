    "intro": "Cassia mollissima, commonly known as velvetleaf cassia, is a tropical shrub native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers followed by elongated pods containing flat, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Cassia mollissima is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
