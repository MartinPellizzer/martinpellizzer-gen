    "intro": "Caladenia filamentosa var. dorrienii, commonly known as the Dorrien's spider orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, spider-like appearance with long, filamentous petals and a narrow, erect flower spike. The plant typically grows in heathland or open woodland habitats, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, often blooming during the cooler months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
