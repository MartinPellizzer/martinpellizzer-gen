    "intro": "Carex rigida f. anguillata, commonly known as the rigid sedge or narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and ribbed, with a dense, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes, which are usually wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshy areas, pond edges, and along stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Carex rigida."
