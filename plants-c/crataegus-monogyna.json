    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red berries in the autumn, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus monogyna is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in hedgerows and gardens. It is relatively hardy and can thrive in a variety of soil types and light conditions."
