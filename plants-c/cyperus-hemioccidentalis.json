    "intro": "Cyperus hemioccidentalis, commonly known as the spiny flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant has slender, triangular stems and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in wet or marshy habitats, making it a common species in wetlands and along water bodies. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive."
