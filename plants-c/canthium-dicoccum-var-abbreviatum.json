    "intro": "Canthium dicoccum var. abbreviatum, commonly known as the short-stalked spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and distinctive floral structures. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in grasslands and along stream banks. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a rough texture, and it produces small, clustered yellow flowers. The fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds through wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats."
