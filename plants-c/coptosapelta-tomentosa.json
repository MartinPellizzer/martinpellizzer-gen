    "intro": "Coptosapelta tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly corymbia, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin strips, and its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in rounded clusters, typically during the winter months. Its fruits are woody capsules that split open to release small, hairy seeds. Coptosapelta tomentosa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climatic conditions."
