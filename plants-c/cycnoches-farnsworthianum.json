    "intro": "Cycnoches farnsworthianum, commonly known as the Farnsworth's cycnoches, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient absorption. Its flowers are usually a mix of white and green hues, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
