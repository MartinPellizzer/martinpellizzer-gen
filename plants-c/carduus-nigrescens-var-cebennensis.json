    "intro": "Carduus nigrescens var. cebennensis, commonly known as the Cebenna thistle, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and a tall, branching stem that produces purple to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other thistle and daisy species. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
