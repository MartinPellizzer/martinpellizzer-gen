    "intro": "Casuarina tephrosperma, commonly known as the narrow-leaved she-oak, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and distinctive cone-like structures that resemble small pine cones. The plant belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in coastal and sandy soils. It produces small, fragrant flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. The tree is often used in reforestation projects due to its hardiness and ecological benefits."
