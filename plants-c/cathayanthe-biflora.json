    "intro": "Cathayanthe biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring two distinct flowers on each inflorescence. The plant produces showy, fragrant blooms in shades of white and yellow, often with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, adapted to thrive in the humid, shaded environments of its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cathayanthe biflora is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
