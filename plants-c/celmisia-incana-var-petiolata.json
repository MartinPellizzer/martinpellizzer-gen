It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, silver-green foliage. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically pale blue to white in color. It thrives in damp, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
