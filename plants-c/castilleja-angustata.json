    "intro": "Castilleja angustata, commonly known as the narrowleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures, relying on host plants for water and nutrients. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often forming dense colonies. Castilleja angustata plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
