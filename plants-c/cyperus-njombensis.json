    "intro": "Cyperus njombensis, commonly known as the Njombe flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and seasonally flooded areas, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. Its flowering stems are often shorter than the leafy basal rosette, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Cyperus njombensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
