    "intro": "Chilostigma, commonly known as the \"bluebell of the Andes,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to South America, particularly the Andean regions of Peru and Bolivia. The plant is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring, often in clusters. Chilostigma species are typically herbaceous perennials with lance-shaped leaves and showy bracts that enhance their ornamental appeal. These plants are sometimes cultivated for their beauty and are also used in traditional medicine in their native regions."
