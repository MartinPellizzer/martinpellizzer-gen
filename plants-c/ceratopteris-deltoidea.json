    "intro": "Ceratopteris deltoidea, commonly known as the deltoid water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the Americas. It is characterized by its deltoid-shaped fronds that are typically divided into lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. This fern thrives in shallow, freshwater environments and is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively. The plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various organisms."
