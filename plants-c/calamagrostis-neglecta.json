    "intro": "Calamagrostis neglecta, commonly known as the silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking silver-gray foliage that becomes more pronounced in the autumn. This plant typically grows in wet to moist soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets that are often tinged with purple or pink. Calamagrostis neglecta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
