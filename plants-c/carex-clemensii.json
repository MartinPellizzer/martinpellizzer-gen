    "intro": "Carex clemensii, commonly known as the Clemens' sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to North America and typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant features grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and have a distinct midrib, with spikelets arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by triangular, three-sided seed capsules. Carex clemensii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
