    "intro": "Chaenomeles japonica var. umbilicata, commonly known as the Japanese flowering quince. It is a deciduous shrub native to Japan, characterized by its dense, thorny branches and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits in the fall, which are edible but often used in traditional Japanese cuisine. Its leaves are ovate and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. The variety umbilicata is distinguished by its compact growth habit and the presence of a small, central bump on the fruit, giving it a unique appearance."
