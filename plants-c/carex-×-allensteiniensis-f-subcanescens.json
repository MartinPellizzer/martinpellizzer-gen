    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 allensteiniensis f. subcanescens, commonly known as the silver-haired sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of eastern North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, swamps, or along stream banks. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. This form is a naturally occurring variant of Carex \u00d7 allensteiniensis, distinguished by its distinctive coloration and habitat preferences."
