    "intro": "Conostegia dentata, commonly known as the toothed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically white or pink, clustered in small inflorescences. The plant produces small, spherical berries that are a source of food for birds and other animals. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent."
