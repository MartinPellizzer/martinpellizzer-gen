It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has long, slender rhizomes that are used in traditional medicine and as a source of materials for crafts. Its leaves are linear and often have a distinctive margin that is slightly curled or toothed. The flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in spikes, and are adapted for wind pollination."
