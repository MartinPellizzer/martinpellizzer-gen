It is characterized by its silvery-white, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal color changes and compact growth habit."
