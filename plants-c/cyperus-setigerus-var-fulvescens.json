    "intro": "Cyperus setigerus var. fulvescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, triangular spikelets arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread vegetatively. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in aquatic landscaping."
