    "intro": "Cardamine hirsuta subsp. multicaulis, commonly known as the hairy watercress, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately arranged leaves that are covered in short, stiff hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as along stream banks and in wet meadows. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes. Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in morphology, particularly in leaf structure and growth habit compared to the main species."
