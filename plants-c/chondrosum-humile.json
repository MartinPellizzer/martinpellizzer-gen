    "intro": "Chondrosum humile, commonly known as the dwarf chondrosum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
