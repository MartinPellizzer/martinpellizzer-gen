It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in countries like Bolivia and Peru. This plant is characterized by its dense, clumping growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to its finely haired leaves. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in cloud forests and p\u00e1ramo ecosystems. Chusquea abietifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for erosion control in its native habitat."
