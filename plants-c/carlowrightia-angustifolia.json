    "intro": "Carlowrightia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed carlowright, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada in California. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist microclimates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected natural areas. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and conservation studies."
