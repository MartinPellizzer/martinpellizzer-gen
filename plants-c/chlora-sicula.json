    "intro": "Chlora sicula, commonly known as the Sicilian Chlorine Plant, is a rare flowering species native to the island of Sicily. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in rocky or limestone areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chlora sicula is considered a vulnerable species."
