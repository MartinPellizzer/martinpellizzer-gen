    "intro": "Centrosema prehensile, commonly known as the climbing peanut vine, is a leguminous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has a climbing habit, supported by its prehensile stems that grasp onto structures for support. Its seed pods contain edible seeds, which are similar to peanuts in appearance and flavor. Centrosema prehensile is often used in agroforestry systems due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
