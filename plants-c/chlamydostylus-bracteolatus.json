    "intro": "Chlamydostylus bracteolatus, commonly known as the bracteolatus cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male cones typically clustered at the base of the plant and female cones emerging from the upper stem. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
