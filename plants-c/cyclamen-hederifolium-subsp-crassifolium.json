    "intro": "Cyclamen hederifolium subsp. crassifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved cyclamen, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and northern Syria. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are broader and thicker than those of the typical Cyclamen hederifolium. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple during late winter to early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers well-drained, sandy soil. Due to its ornamental value and delicate appearance, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
