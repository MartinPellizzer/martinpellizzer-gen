    "intro": "Cicer, commonly known as chickpea, is an annual legume belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and pods containing numerous kidney-shaped seeds. The plant thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Chickpeas are rich in protein and are widely cultivated for both human consumption and animal feed. They also play a significant role in crop rotation due to their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen."
