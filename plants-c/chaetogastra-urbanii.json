    "intro": "Chaetogastra urbanii, commonly known as the urbanii grass, is a perennial herb native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
