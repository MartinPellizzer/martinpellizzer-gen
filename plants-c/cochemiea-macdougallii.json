It is a small, low-growing plant with a short, cylindrical stem covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent stems. Cochemiea macdougallii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
