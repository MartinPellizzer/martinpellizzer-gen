    "intro": "Cotoneaster horizontalis f. ascendens, commonly known as the ascending cotoneaster, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. Its growth habit is upright and spreading, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, exhibiting good tolerance to frost and drought."
