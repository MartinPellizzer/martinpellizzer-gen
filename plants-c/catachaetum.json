These plants are native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines. Catachaetum species are characterized by their striking, butterfly-like flowers that are often brightly colored and fragrant. They typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks in their natural habitat. The genus includes several species, such as Catachaetum sanguineum, which is noted for its vibrant red and yellow blooms."
