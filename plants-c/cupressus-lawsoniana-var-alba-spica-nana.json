    "intro": "Cupressus lawsoniana var. alba-spica-nana, commonly known as the dwarf white-flowered lacebark cedar, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely textured, feathery foliage that turns a striking silver-white in winter, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous cones and has a unique, flattened, scale-like leaf structure. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a decorative accent plant. Its ornamental value lies in its elegant form and seasonal color changes."
