    "intro": "Caletia ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf caletia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, oval-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Caletia ovalifolia thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for shaded garden environments."
