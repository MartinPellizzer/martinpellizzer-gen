    "intro": "Carex grisea var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and gray-green in color, with a dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and wet meadows. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
