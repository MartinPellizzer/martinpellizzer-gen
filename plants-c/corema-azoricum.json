    "intro": "Corema azoricum, commonly known as the Azorean corema, is a rare and endemic shrub native to the Azores. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers, which are usually pink or white, bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Corema azoricum is considered a vulnerable species."
