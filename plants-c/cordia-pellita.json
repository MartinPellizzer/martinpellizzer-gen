    "intro": "Cordia pellita, commonly known as the red cordia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as birds and bees. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal."
