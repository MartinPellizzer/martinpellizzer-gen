    "intro": "Calylophus hartwegii subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy calylophus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its hairy foliage and stems, which provide a distinguishing feature from other subspecies. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant's structure and adaptations reflect its evolutionary response to the harsh conditions of its native habitat."
