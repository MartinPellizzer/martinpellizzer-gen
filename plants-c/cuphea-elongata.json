    "intro": "Cuphea elongata, commonly known as the flame flower, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red flowers that resemble flames, which bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Cuphea elongata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a potted plant."
