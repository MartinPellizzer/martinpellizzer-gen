    "intro": "Cyclosorus philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are divided into four lobes, resembling a four-leaf clover. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. Cyclosorus philippinensis plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering impurities and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
