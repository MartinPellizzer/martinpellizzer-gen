    "intro": "Castilleja collegiorum, commonly known as the College Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has modified stems that perform photosynthesis. It attaches to the roots of other plants, drawing water and nutrients from its host. This relationship can weaken the host plant, making Castilleja collegiorum an important species in ecological studies of plant interactions."
