    "intro": "Cyperus saturatus, commonly known as the marsh flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils. Cyperus saturatus is also used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from contaminated water."
