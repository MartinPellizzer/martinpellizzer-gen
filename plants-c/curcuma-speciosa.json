    "intro": "Curcuma speciosa, commonly known as the golden ginger or ornamental turmeric, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, and is characterized by its ornamental, sword-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces clusters of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Its rhizomes, while not as widely used for culinary purposes as other curcuma species, are sometimes employed in traditional medicine. Curcuma speciosa is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and as a decorative plant."
