It is native to tropical regions of Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. The plants typically have large, showy inflorescences composed of a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe. Chironia species are often found in wetland or swampy habitats, where they thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Some species are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their striking floral displays."
