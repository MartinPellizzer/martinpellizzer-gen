    "intro": "Claoxylon, commonly known as the \"barkless tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Asia and is characterized by its unique lack of true bark, with a smooth, greenish-gray stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating. Claoxylon species are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though they are not widely cultivated for commercial purposes."
