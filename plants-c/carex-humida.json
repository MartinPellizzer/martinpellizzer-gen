    "intro": "Carex humida, commonly known as the bog sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. Carex humida thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
