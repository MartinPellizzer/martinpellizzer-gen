    "intro": "Castilleja ctenodonta var. altorum, commonly known as the tall hedgehog cactus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially derives nutrients from its host plants. The plant features a tall, branched stem with dense clusters of bright orange to red tubular flowers. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
