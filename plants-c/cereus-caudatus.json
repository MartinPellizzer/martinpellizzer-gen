    "intro": "Cereus caudatus, commonly known as the long-spurred night bloomer, is a cactus native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and spiny, ribbed structure, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its flowers are typically borne on long, slender pedicels, giving it its common name. Cereus caudatus is often cultivated for its striking appearance and unique nocturnal flowering habit."
