    "intro": "Casparya ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty leaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a distinctive rusty-colored bloom of fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, orange-red seed capsules. Casparya ferruginea is typically found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid environments. Its foliage and floral structures are well-suited for reducing water loss and maximizing sunlight absorption."
