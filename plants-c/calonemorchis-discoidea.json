    "intro": "Calonemorchis discoidea, commonly known as the disk-shaped liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its flattened, disk-like thallus that is typically green or reddish in color. This liverwort thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its structure consists of a central stalk with leaf-like structures called phyllidia arranged radially. Calonemorchis discoidea plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for small invertebrates."
