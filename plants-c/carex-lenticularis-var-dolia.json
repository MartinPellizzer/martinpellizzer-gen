    "intro": "Carex lenticularis var. dolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. This variety is distinguished by its slightly narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Carex lenticularis."
