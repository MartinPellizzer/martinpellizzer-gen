It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features showy, yellow-orange ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Chrysodium speciosum is often found in moist, shaded environments within forest undergrowth."
