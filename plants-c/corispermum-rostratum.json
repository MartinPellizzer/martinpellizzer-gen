    "intro": "Corispermum rostratum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandmat, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Chenopodiaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in sandy or arid environments. The plant features small, green, ovate leaves and produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers. It is adapted to harsh conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Corispermum rostratum is often found in coastal dunes and other dry, sandy habitats."
