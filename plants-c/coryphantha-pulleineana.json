    "intro": "Coryphantha pulleineana, commonly known as the Puppenkugel, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical or globose shape, with a dense covering of spines and a ribbed structure that aids in water storage and reduces transpiration. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the top of the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and compact size, it is well-suited for container gardening and small landscapes."
