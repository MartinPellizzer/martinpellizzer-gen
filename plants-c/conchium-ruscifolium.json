    "intro": "Conchium ruscifolium, commonly known as the forest spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a rosette of lance-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cyme, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, containing compounds that have been studied for their medicinal properties. Conchium ruscifolium thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
