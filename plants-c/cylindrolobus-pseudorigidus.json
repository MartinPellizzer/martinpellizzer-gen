    "intro": "Cylindrolobus pseudorigidus, commonly known as the rigid thornbush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its densely branched structure and thorny stems, which provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are small, elliptical, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Cylindrolobus pseudorigidus thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along coastal areas."
