    "intro": "Cestrum subuniflorum var. seminudum, commonly known as the naked-stemmed nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its nocturnal blooming habit and attractive appearance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
