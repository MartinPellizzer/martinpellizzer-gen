    "intro": "Centaurothamnus maximus, commonly known as the large centaurothamnus, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. The species is adapted to poor, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
