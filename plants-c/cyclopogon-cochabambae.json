    "intro": "Cyclopogon cochabambae, commonly known as the Cochabamba cyclopogon, is a rare bromeliad native to Bolivia. It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
