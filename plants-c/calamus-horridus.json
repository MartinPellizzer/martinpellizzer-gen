    "intro": "Calamus horridus, commonly known as the horrid calamus, is a member of the Arecaceae family, native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is a tall, robust grass-like plant that can grow up to several meters in height, characterized by its long, narrow leaves and clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, followed by the development of hard, woody fruits containing minute seeds. Calamus horridus is often found in wetland or swampy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its ornamental value is less prominent compared to other calamus species."
