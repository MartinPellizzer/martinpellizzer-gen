    "intro": "Chaetochloa caudata, commonly known as the tufted bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. Chaetochloa caudata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
