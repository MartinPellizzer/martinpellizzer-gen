It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its vibrant, contrasting foliage with dark purple to almost black leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, often clustered in whorls along the stems. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for indoor gardening."
