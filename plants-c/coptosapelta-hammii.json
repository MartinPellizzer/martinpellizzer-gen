It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Coptosapelta hammii is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in sandy or rocky soils."
