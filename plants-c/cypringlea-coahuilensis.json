    "intro": "Cypringlea coahuilensis, commonly known as the Coahuila lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
