    "intro": "Ctenopteris mollissima, commonly known as the silky water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, almost velvety texture. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Ctenopteris mollissima is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
