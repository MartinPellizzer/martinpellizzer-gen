    "intro": "Chamaeraphis spinescens var. brunoniana, commonly known as the bronzeweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, spiny leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Its spines are a defense mechanism against herbivores, and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting pollinators."
