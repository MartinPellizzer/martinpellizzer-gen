It belongs to the sedge family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist habitats, often forming dense mats. Cyperus tatandaensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments."
