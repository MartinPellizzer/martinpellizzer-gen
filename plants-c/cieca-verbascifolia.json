    "intro": "Cieca verbascifolia, commonly known as the woolly flaxflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its scientific name reflects its resemblance to the flax plant, with \"verbascifolia\" referring to its leaf structure. Cieca verbascifolia is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
