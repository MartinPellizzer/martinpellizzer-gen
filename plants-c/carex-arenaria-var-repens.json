    "intro": "Carex arenaria var. repens, commonly known as sand sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and coastal environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are often hidden among the foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or rocky areas. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective stabilizer of sandy soils and a valuable plant for erosion control."
