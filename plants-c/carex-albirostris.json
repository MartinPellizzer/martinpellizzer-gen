    "intro": "Carex albirostris, commonly known as the white-beaked sedge, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in wet areas. Carex albirostris is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability to waterlogged conditions."
