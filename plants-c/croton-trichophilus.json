It is characterized by its large, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by orange to red berries containing seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens."
