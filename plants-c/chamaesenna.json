These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. They are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from red to yellow and orange. The leaves are typically alternate, simple, and ovate, with a rough texture. Chamaesenna species often grow as shrubs or small trees, and they are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
