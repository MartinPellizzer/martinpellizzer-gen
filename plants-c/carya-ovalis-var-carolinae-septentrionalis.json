    "intro": "Carya ovalis var. carolinae-septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern hickory, is a variant of the hickory tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its oval-shaped nuts, which are typically enclosed in a thick, woody husk. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value. The tree produces catkins as male flowers and female flowers are found in clusters. Its wood is hard and durable, making it valuable for furniture and tool-making."
