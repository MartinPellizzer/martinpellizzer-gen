    "intro": "Conanthera passeriflora f. immaculata, commonly known as the immaculate pasqueflower, is a rare and striking botanical specimen native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae, which includes buttercups and other showy flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its delicate, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves with finely divided lobes, typical of the genus Conanthera. This form is distinguished by its lack of the typical purple markings found on the standard species, making it a unique and sought-after cultivar in botanical gardens."
