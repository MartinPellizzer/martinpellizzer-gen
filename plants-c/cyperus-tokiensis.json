    "intro": "Cyperus tokiensis, commonly known as the Japanese flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered spikelets. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, making it a common sight in wetlands and along water bodies. It produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in suitable environments. Cyperus tokiensis is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive appearance and adaptability."
