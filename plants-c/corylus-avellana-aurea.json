    "intro": "Corylus avellana aurea, commonly known as the golden hazel, is a cultivar of the hazelnut tree known for its striking yellow foliage. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 4 to 8 meters. The leaves are ovate with a serrated margin and turn a vibrant yellow in the autumn, making it a popular ornamental plant. It produces small, edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, similar to other hazel species. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for garden landscapes."
