    "intro": "Cassuvium cuneatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sunspire, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, sword-shaped leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, Cassuvium cuneatum is considered endangered and is protected in several national parks."
