    "intro": "Cactus eborinus, commonly known as the Eborin cactus, is a species native to the Canary Islands. It is a small, spineless plant with a globular shape and a greyish-green color. The plant features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters during the summer months. Cactus eborinus is well adapted to rocky, coastal environments and requires minimal care once established."
