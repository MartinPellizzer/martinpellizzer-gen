    "intro": "Cenchrus prolificus, commonly known as the desert grass or prolific grass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its robust, fibrous root system that allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought. The plant produces dense tufts of narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny spikelets. It is often used for erosion control due to its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil. Additionally, it serves as forage for livestock in regions where other vegetation is scarce."
