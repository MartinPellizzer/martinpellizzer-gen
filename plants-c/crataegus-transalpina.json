It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges, rocky slopes, and open woodlands. Crataegus transalpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators and wildlife."
