    "intro": "Cystanthe, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking, spiny leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and sandy soils, where they thrive in well-drained conditions. Cystanthe species are often used in ornamental gardening due to their unique appearance and hardy nature. They play a role in supporting local pollinators and contribute to coastal ecosystem stability."
