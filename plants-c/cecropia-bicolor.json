    "intro": "Cecropia bicolor, commonly known as the white-veined cecropia, is a fast-growing tree native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with distinctive white veins, which help in photosynthesis and water conservation. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into woody pods containing seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats and is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Cecropia bicolor plays an important ecological role in providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
