    "intro": "Cistus ladanifer subsp. europaeus, commonly known as the European rockrose, is a shrub native to southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic evergreen leaves and clusters of pink to white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a resinous substance called labdanum, which has been historically used in perfumery and traditional medicine. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to Mediterranean climates. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
