    "intro": "Carex rochebrunei subsp. reptans, commonly known as the creeping sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist or wet environments such as marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. The subspecies reptans is distinguished by its creeping growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread along the ground."
