    "intro": "Cryptosorus decrescens, commonly known as the creeping woodfern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, creeping growth habit and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous structure that allows it to spread and form thick mats. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, narrow shape. Cryptosorus decrescens plays an important role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
