    "intro": "Calamus viminalis subsp. prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate sweet flag, is a member of the Arecaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. This subspecies is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous habit, with long, narrow leaves that often lie flat on the ground. It produces small, fragrant flowers arranged in inflorescences, which are typically yellow or greenish in color. The plant is often found in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its aromatic properties have made it historically valuable in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
