    "intro": "Coryanthes bergoldii, commonly known as the Berggold's coryanthe, is a rare and striking orchid native to the rainforests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its large, intricate flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, with a distinctive hooded structure and vibrant colors. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish, including high humidity and well-draining soil. Its unique floral morphology is adapted for pollination by specific insect species, such as beetles. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern and is often found in protected areas."
