    "intro": "Carex infuscata var. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, cylindrical spikes of greenish-yellow flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability to wet conditions."
