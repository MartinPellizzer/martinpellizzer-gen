    "intro": "Coleus dichotomus, commonly known as the two-branched coleus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive branching pattern, where each stem splits into two equal parts, creating a symmetrical appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture with a range of colors from green to red. Coleus dichotomus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique form and aesthetic appeal."
