    "intro": "Ceratopteris pteroides, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a member of the fern family and is characterized by its large, floating fronds. It is native to tropical regions and thrives in moist, aquatic environments. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing spores on the underside of its fronds rather than seeds. Its fronds are divided into small, finger-like segments that help in photosynthesis and buoyancy. It is often used in scientific research due to its rapid growth and ease of cultivation."
