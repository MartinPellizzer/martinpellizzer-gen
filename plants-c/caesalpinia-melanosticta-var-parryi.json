    "intro": "Caesalpinia melanosticta var. parryi, commonly known as the Parry's ticktree, is a shrub or small tree native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, stipitate leaflets and bright yellow flowers that bloom in dense, racemose inflorescences. The plant produces hard, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species in semi-arid environments. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant floral display and unique foliage structure."
