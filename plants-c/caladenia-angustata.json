    "intro": "Caladenia angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed spider-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Australia. It features a slender, leafless stem with a single, elongated flower that is typically pale green to yellow in color. The plant produces a single, downward-facing flower with a distinctive, narrow labellum that resembles a spider's leg, giving it its common name. It blooms during the autumn season and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The species is noted for its striking appearance and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
