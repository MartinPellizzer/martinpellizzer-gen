    "intro": "Cardamine altigena, commonly known as the narrowleaf watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant features slender, upright stems with trifoliate leaves, each leaflet being elongated and pointed. Its small, white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early spring. The plant is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
