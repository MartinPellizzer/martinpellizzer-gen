    "intro": "Cyrtandra hypogaea, commonly known as the Hawaiian ground orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its unique, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories, and has a creeping rhizome that helps it spread. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in clusters at the base of the plant. Cyrtandra hypogaea is an important component of Hawaii's native flora and is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of the region."
