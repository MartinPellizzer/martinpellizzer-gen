    "intro": "Cotoneaster vulgaris var. erythrocarpus, commonly known as the red-fruited cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern Himalayas. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters and features small, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that persist through the winter. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
