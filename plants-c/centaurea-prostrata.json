    "intro": "Centaurea prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate knapweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, often prostrate stems that spread along the ground, covered in fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with purple or brown centers, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slightly rough texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Centaurea prostrata is often found in dry grasslands, rocky areas, and disturbed sites, making it a hardy and adaptable species."
