    "intro": "Chenopodium anthelminticum, commonly known as pigweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its upright stems, lance-shaped leaves, and small greenish-white flowers. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and agricultural fields, due to its adaptability to various soil types. It produces tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread easily. Chenopodium anthelminticum is also noted for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional herbal remedies."
