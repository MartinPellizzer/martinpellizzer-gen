    "intro": "Cordia membranacea, commonly known as the paperleaf cordia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its thin, papery leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or disturbed habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
