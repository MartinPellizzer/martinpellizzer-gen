    "intro": "Circaea alpina var. imaicola, commonly known as the Imai's wintergreen, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of East Asia. It produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface, adapted to cold and windy environments. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soils at high elevations. This variant is distinguished by its unique floral structure and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
