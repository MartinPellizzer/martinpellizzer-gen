    "intro": "Coffea campaniensis, commonly known as the Campanian coffee, is a species of flowering plant native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by bright red berries containing the coffee beans. Its botanical characteristics make it distinct from other coffee species, with a unique growth habit and floral structure. Due to its limited distribution and rarity, it is considered an important but under-researched species within the Coffea genus."
