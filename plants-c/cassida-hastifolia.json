    "intro": "Cassida hastifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, whitish coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It is well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy plant in xeriscaped gardens. Its dense growth habit also provides habitat for various insects and small animals."
