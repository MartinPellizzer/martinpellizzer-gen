    "intro": "Cadelium nigrum, commonly known as black cadelium, is a rare and unique plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, foliage and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a woody stem with a smooth, glossy surface, and its leaves are typically elliptical in shape. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
