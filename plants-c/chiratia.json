    "intro": "Chiratia, commonly known as mountain sandwort, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. These plants are typically small, herbaceous, and often found in alpine or rocky habitats. They have basal leaves that are often linear or lance-shaped, and their flowers are small, white or yellow, arranged in clusters. Chiratia species are characterized by their simple, usually four-petaled flowers and their ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The genus includes several species, many of which are native to the Himalayas and other mountainous regions."
