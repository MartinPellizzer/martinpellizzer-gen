    "intro": "Cyrtochilum mystacinum, commonly known as the mystacine orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The plant has a short, stocky rhizome and features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Cyrtochilum mystacinum is adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and good drainage for optimal growth. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by small insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
