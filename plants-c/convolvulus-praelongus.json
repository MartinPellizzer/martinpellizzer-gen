    "intro": "Convolvulus praelongus, commonly known as the long-stemmed bindweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing habit, with slender, hairy stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pale purple or white, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and can persist in the soil for many years. Convolvulus praelongus is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly in disturbed soils."
