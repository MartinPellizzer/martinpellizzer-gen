    "intro": "Canarium subulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved candlenut, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. Its bark is typically smooth and grayish-brown, with a strong, aromatic scent. Canarium subulatum is often found in lowland forests and is valued for its timber and traditional uses."
