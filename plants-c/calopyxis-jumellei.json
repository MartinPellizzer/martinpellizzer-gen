    "intro": "Calopyxis jumellei, commonly known as the Jumelle's calopyxis, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its unique morphological features. The plant typically exhibits a shrub-like growth habit with woody stems and hairy foliage. It produces small, clustered flowers that are often pink or purple in color, and its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds upon maturity. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Calopyxis jumellei is considered a botanically significant but endangered species."
