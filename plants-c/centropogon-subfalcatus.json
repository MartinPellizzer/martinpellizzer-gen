    "intro": "Centropogon subfalcatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf false pigeonwings, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along stream banks, thriving in moist, sandy soils. Its flowers are often bright red or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
