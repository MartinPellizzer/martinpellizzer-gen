    "intro": "Cotoneaster spicatus, commonly known as the spiny cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Cotoneaster spicatus typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and prefers well-drained, sunny to partially shaded soils. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
