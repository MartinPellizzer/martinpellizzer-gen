    "intro": "Ctenitis fraterna subsp. biokoensis, commonly known as the Bioko Ctenitis, is a rare fern species native to the island of Bioko in Equatorial Guinea. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
