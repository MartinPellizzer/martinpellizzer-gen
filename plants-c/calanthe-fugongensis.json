    "intro": "Calanthe fugongensis, commonly known as the Fugong orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact, evergreen rhizome and clustered pseudobulbs. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with intricate patterns and a variety of colors, typically white or pale pink, during the spring season. Calanthe fugongensis thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, often growing in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
