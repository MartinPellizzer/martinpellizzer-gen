    "intro": "Calophyllum pseudowallichianum, commonly known as the false white sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Calophyllaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, elliptical leaves. The tree produces yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing a single seed. It is often found in lowland forests and is valued for its aromatic wood, though it is less commercially significant than other calophyllum species. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
