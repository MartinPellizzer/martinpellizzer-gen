    "intro": "Cereus serpentinus var. splendens, commonly known as the Splendour Cereus, is a cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, a trait typical of many night-blooming cacti. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system adapted to arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
