    "intro": "Cyclosorus extensus, commonly known as the broad-leaved water clover, is a species of aquatic fern native to freshwater habitats in Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, floating leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface. The plant has creeping rhizomes that help it spread and colonize new areas. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are borne in clusters and are pollinated by wind. Cyclosorus extensus plays a role in stabilizing water ecosystems by reducing wave action and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
