    "intro": "Cynanchum retropilum, commonly known as the backward-hanging milkweed, is a perennial herb native to China. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbellate clusters, followed by follicles containing toxic, milky sap. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically used in traditional medicine."
