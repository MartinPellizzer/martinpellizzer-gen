    "intro": "Chorizanthe coriacea, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, purple, or white. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. Chorizanthe coriacea is adapted to full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping."
