    "intro": "Conchophyllum celebicum, commonly known as the Celebes sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Indonesian archipelago. It is a shrub that typically grows along coastal areas and mangrove forests, thriving in saline and brackish water environments. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually bright yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to reduce water loss in its humid, coastal habitat. The plant plays a role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial wildlife."
