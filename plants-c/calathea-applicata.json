It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that display a mix of green, silver, and pink hues. The leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a velvety texture that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Calathea applicata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
