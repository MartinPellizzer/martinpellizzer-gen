    "intro": "Cordia carnosa, commonly known as the fat-leaf tree or wax tree, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by orange or red, fleshy fruits. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for various purposes. Cordia carnosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
