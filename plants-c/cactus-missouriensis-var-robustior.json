    "intro": "Cactus missouriensis var. robustior, commonly known as the Missouri prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the central United States. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and spiny areoles, which are typical features of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by edible fruits resembling small, green figs. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in prairies and rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperature fluctuations."
