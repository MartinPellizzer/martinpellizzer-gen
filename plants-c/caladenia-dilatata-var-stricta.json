It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The flowers are typically pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of spider-like structures. This variety is often found in heathlands and open forests, thriving in well-drained soils. It is a protected species due to habitat loss and is often cultivated in conservation programs."
