    "intro": "Cynorkis fastigiata var. hygrophila, commonly known as the narrowleaf water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features upright, narrow leaves that are typically coated with a waxy layer, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist to aquatic conditions, often found in marshes, stream banks, and ponds. Its botanical structure makes it well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats, contributing to its ecological significance in wetland ecosystems."
