    "intro": "Carex glauca var. micheliana, commonly known as blue sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that ranges from blue-green to silver-gray in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is a popular choice for wetland gardens and ecological restoration projects."
