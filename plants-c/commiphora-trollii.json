    "intro": "Commiphora trollii, commonly known as the Somali myrrh tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the dry, arid regions of Somalia and Ethiopia. It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes frankincense and myrrh trees, and is characterized by its aromatic resins. The tree produces a reddish-brown resin that has been historically used in traditional medicine and incense. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture, while its bark is thick and fissured. Commiphora trollii is adapted to extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
