    "intro": "Carlina, commonly known as the \"Cocklebur,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their spiny, rough-textured leaves and showy, yellow-orange composite flower heads. Carlina species are native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, often found in rocky or arid environments. They produce small, hard-seeded fruits that are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals. The genus includes both annual and perennial species, with some being cultivated for ornamental purposes."
