    "intro": "Caucanthus albidus var. fimbripetalus, commonly known as the white caucanthus, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its large, pale white petals that resemble a fan shape, giving it the common name \"fimbripetalus,\" which refers to its fringed petal edges. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its blooming period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
