    "intro": "Casearia dubia, commonly known as the red-flowered casearia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Salicaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to red, depending on the variety. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Casearia dubia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks."
