    "intro": "Chrysocoma saxatilis, commonly known as the rock chrysocoma, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are yellow and clustered in terminal inflorescences, adding visual interest to the landscape. Chrysocoma saxatilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
