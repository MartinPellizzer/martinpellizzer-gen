    "intro": "Clerodendrum thomsoniae var. balfourii, commonly known as the Balfour's glorybower, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy bract-based inflorescences that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often surrounded by brightly colored, leaf-like structures. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface."
