    "intro": "Cybbanthera connata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of pink to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cybbanthera connata is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. Its drought tolerance makes it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
