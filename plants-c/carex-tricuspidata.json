    "intro": "Carex tricuspidata, commonly known as the three-lobed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Carex tricuspidata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
