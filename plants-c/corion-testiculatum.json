    "intro": "Corion testiculatum, commonly known as the testicle cactus, is a unique species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded, and often clustered stems that resemble testes, giving it its unusual common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green, fleshy stems. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water, storing moisture in its thick, succulent stems. Due to its rare and specific habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
