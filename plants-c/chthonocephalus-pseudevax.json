    "intro": "Chthonocephalus pseudevax, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for nutrient absorption. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and decaying organic matter. Due to its habitat specificity and declining environment, it is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation efforts."
