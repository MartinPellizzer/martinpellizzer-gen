    "intro": "Coix agrestis, commonly known as wild millet, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and has fibrous, rhizomatous roots that help it spread vegetatively. Coix agrestis is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides, streambanks, and wetlands. It is valued for its adaptability and has been used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop in some regions."
