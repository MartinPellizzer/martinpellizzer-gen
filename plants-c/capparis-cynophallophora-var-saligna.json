    "intro": "Capparis cynophallophora var. saligna, commonly known as the narrow-leaved caper, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
