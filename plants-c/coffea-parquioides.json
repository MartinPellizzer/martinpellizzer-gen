    "intro": "Coffea parquioides, commonly known as the dwarf coffee plant, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its compact size and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small white flowers that give way to red berries containing its seeds, which are used for coffee production. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and limited commercial cultivation, it is less commonly found in global coffee markets compared to other Coffea species."
