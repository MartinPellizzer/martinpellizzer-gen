It is characterized by its striking white flowers, which contrast with its broad, lance-shaped leaves. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or wetlands. Its flowering period occurs during the warmer months, and it produces small, three-lobed berries. The plant exhibits rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
