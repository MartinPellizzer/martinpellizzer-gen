    "intro": "Copiapoa calderana subsp. atacamensis, commonly known as the Atacama copiapoa, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northern Chile. It is a columnar cactus with a solitary stem that often develops a bulbous base as it matures. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It is adapted to extreme desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. This subspecies is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
