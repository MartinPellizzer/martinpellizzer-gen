    "intro": "Cantua floridana, commonly known as the Florida cantua, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight. Due to habitat loss, Cantua floridana is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
