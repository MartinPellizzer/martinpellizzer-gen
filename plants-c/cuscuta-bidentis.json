    "intro": "Cuscuta bidentis, commonly known as the two-tooth dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a rapid growth pattern, often forming dense mats on its host. The plant's stem is slender and covered with tiny, hair-like structures that help it adhere to its host. It is commonly found in agricultural fields and gardens, where it can cause significant damage to crops. Its life cycle involves germinating from seeds and establishing a connection with the vascular system of the host plant."
