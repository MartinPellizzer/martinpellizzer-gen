It is characterized by its striking white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a compact growth habit and produces small, oval-shaped leaves with a waxy texture. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is highly valued in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
