    "intro": "Corchorus brevicaulis, commonly known as the short-stemmed dock, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its fibrous stems, it has been historically used for making textiles and paper."
