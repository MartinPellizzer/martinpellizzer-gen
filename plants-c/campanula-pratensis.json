    "intro": "Campanula pratensis, commonly known as the meadow bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, while its flowers are often clustered in racemes. Campanula pratensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
