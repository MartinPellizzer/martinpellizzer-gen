    "intro": "Corylopsis grata, commonly known as the golden thread, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and has slender, arching branches. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, turning yellow in the fall. Corylopsis grata thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
