    "intro": "Croton witterianus, commonly known as the African croton, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often variegated with yellow, white, or green markings. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into three-lobed, orange-red fruits. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antimalarial properties. Croton witterianus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or savanna habitats."
