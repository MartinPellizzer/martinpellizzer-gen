    "intro": "Czernya, commonly known as the black poplar, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark, bark-like appearance and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Czernya thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and wetlands. It has been historically used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
