    "intro": "Cyclostemon incarnatus, commonly known as the pink cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves that are typically a vibrant pink or red color. The plant produces small, spherical cones that are usually green or yellow when immature. It is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia and thrives in warm, humid climates. Due to its striking appearance and slow growth, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
