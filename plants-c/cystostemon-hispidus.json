    "intro": "Cystostemon hispidus, commonly known as the rough-stemmed cystostemon, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
