    "intro": "Cyperus polystachyos var. hahnianus, commonly known as the Hahn's flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas in the Americas. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in spikelets. It thrives in moist to aquatic environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its adaptability, it is both a common weed in wetland restoration projects and a valuable indicator species for wetland health."
