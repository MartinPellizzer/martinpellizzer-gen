    "intro": "Chaetochloa ramiseta, commonly known as the hairy marsh grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marsh environments. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in moist habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in shallow water or saturated soil, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems. Its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms highlights its ecological significance."
