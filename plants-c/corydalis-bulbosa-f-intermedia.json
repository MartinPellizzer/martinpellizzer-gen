    "intro": "Corydalis bulbosa f. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate bulbous corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots and delicate, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows in woodland habitats and prefers well-drained, moist soils. Its flowers, which are usually pink or purple, bloom in early spring and are relatively short-lived. This form is distinguished from the typical species by its intermediate morphological traits and slightly different flowering habits."
