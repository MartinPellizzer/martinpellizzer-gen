It features opposite, ovate to obovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in clusters, typically white or yellow, which bloom in late spring. Its berries are red or black and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. It thrives in woodland edges and moist soils, and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
