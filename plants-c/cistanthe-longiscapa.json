    "intro": "Cistanthe longiscapa, commonly known as the long-stemmed cistanthe, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, commonly referred to as the ice plant family. The plant is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which are adapted to arid environments. Its small, star-shaped flowers are typically yellow or orange, blooming during the cooler months. Cistanthe longiscapa is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xerophytic gardens due to its low water requirements."
