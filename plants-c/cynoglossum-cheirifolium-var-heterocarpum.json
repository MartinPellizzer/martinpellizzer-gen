    "intro": "Cynoglossum cheirifolium var. heterocarpum, commonly known as the Algerian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with purple, and it produces striking blue to violet flowers in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. Its flowers are tubular and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The variety heterocarpum is distinguished by its unique seed capsule structure, which sets it apart from other forms of Cynoglossum."
