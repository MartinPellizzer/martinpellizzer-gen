    "intro": "Crepis murorum, commonly known as the wall mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or disturbed soils, often found along walls or in dry grasslands. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into achene fruits. Crepis murorum is often considered a weed but has ecological value in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil."
