It is characterized by its grayish-green, spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance, while its flowers are arranged in a compact, spherical head. Carduus cinerascens is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
