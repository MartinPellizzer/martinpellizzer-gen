    "intro": "Castanola insignis, commonly known as the rare and elusive mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, large, showy flowers that range in color from deep red to pale pink. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a cool, temperate climate to flourish. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Castanola insignis is considered a rare and endangered species."
