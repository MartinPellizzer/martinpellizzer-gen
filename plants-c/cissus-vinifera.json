It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, translucent glands. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into edible, grape-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Cissus vinifera is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and vigorous growth habit."
