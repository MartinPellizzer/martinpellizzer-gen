It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that resemble trumpets, which bloom in clusters. The plant has a woody stem with smooth, green bark that becomes rougher with age. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical in shape, often with a slightly waxy texture. Cymonetra is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
