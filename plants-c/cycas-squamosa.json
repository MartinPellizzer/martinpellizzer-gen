    "intro": "Cycas squamosa, commonly known as the broad-leaved cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, and it has a long lifespan, often living over 100 years. Cycas squamosa is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and requires well-drained soil. Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species in both horticulture and conservation efforts."
