    "intro": "Chenopodium album var. oblongum, commonly known as purslane, is an annual herbaceous plant characterized by its prostrate growth habit and fleshy, succulent leaves. It features small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its leaves are typically oval or oblong in shape, which gives it its specific variety name. The plant is native to Europe, Asia, and Africa but has been naturalized in many regions around the world. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields, where it can become a weed. Chenopodium album var. oblongum is also known for its nutritional value, containing high levels of omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants."
