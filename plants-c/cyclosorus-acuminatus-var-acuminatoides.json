    "intro": "Cyclosorus acuminatus var. acuminatoides, commonly known as the acuminatoides variety of the cyclosorus, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding water. This variety is noted for its ornamental value in aquatic gardens and its role in maintaining water quality in natural habitats."
