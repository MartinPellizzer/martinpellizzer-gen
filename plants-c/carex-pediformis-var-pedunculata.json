    "intro": "Carex pediformis var. pedunculata, commonly known as the slender flatleaf sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for wetland gardens and restoration projects."
