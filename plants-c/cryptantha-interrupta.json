    "intro": "Cryptantha interrupta, commonly known as the narrowleaf cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind or through attachment to animals. Cryptantha interrupta plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
