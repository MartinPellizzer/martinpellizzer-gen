It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mound-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, velvety flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, often with a distinctive central spot. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. Crypsinus moseleyi thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
