    "intro": "Crepidium sichuanicum, commonly known as the Sichuan orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a loose spike, with three sepals and three petals. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
