    "intro": "Celtis alpina, commonly known as the European hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows to a height of 5\u201315 meters and has smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by spherical, green berries that turn dark blue when mature. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and have a slightly serrated edge. Celtis alpina is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in forests, along riverbanks, and in open woodlands."
