    "intro": "Campanula allophylla, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the stems are often covered in fine hairs. Campanula allophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
