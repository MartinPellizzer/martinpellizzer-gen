    "intro": "Cyclosorus reederi, commonly known as the Reeder's water clover, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, often forming dense mats. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually submerged and pollinated by aquatic insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclosorus reederi is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality and ecological health."
