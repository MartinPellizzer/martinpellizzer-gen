It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces pale pink to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Cracca is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in dry, open habitats. It is valued in some regions for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
