    "intro": "Corallorhiza striata var. involuta, commonly known as the curled beardtongue, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal networks for nutrients. The plant has a slender, hairy stem with whorled, lance-shaped leaves that are often curled or twisted. Its flowers are typically pink to reddish-purple, with a distinctive spurred lip and showy, recurved petals. This variant is distinguished by its involute (curled) leaf arrangement, which is a key feature in its botanical classification."
