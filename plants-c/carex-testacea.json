It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers, typical of many sedges. Carex testacea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
