    "intro": "Croton petraeus var. oblongifolius, commonly known as the rock croton, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically oblong in shape, with a deep green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes reddish underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange to red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical landscapes."
