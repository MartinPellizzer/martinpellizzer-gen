    "intro": "Coleus scutellarioides var. angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaf coleus, is a herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with striking variegation, often in shades of white and pink. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pale purple or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage rather than its flowers, making it a favorite in container gardening and landscape design."
