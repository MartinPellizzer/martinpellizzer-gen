    "intro": "Carpinus betulus var. serrata, commonly known as the European hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, smooth, gray bark and its distinctive, elongated, serrated leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, spherical fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. This variety is notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, making it a valuable species in ecological and ornamental contexts."
