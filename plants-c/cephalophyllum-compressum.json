    "intro": "Cephalophyllum compressum, commonly known as the flat-headed cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated in arid environments."
