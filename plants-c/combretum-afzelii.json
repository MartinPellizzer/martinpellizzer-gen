It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that appear in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are typically ovate or elliptic in shape. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in savanna and woodland habitats. The bark is smooth and may exude a milky sap when damaged."
