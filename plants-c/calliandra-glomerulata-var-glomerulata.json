It is characterized by its distinctive, clustered inflorescences that produce vibrant, often pink or red, tubular flowers. The plant has compound leaves composed of numerous small, pointed leaflets, and it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its showy blooms. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for warm, arid climates. The flowers are also used in some traditional practices and can attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
