    "intro": "Crepis glabrata, commonly known as the smooth hawk's-beard, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring basal leaves that are lobed and covered in fine hairs. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Crepis glabrata is often found in dry meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
