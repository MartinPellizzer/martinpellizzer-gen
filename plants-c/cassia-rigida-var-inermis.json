    "intro": "Cassia rigida var. inermis, commonly known as the smooth cassia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States. It features compound leaves with oval, smooth-edged leaflets that turn a striking coppery color in the fall. The plant produces small, yellow, butterfly-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by long, cylindrical seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a drought-tolerant addition to xeriscaped gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and unique floral display."
