    "intro": "Cyclosorus dulitensis, commonly known as the Dullit Islands water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that form dense mats on the water surface. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing spores in specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often in shaded, nutrient-rich environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclosorus dulitensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
