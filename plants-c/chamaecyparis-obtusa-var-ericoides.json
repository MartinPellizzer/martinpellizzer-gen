    "intro": "Chamaecyparis obtusa var. ericoides, commonly known as the Japanese false cypress or ericoid false cypress, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen conifer. It features scale-like leaves that are closely pressed to the branches, giving it a dense, mat-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous cones and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for shaded woodland areas. Its ornamental value lies in its neat form and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
