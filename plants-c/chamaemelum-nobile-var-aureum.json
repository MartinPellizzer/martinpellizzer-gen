    "intro": "Chamaemelum nobile var. aureum, commonly known as the golden chamomile, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe. It features finely divided, feathery leaves and produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers with a white center. The plant is closely related to the common chamomile, but it has a more compact growth habit and a stronger, sweeter aroma. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden use. Its flowers are often used in teas and aromatherapy due to their calming properties."
