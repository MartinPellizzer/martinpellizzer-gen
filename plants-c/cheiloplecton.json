    "intro": "Cheiloplecton, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange composite flowers that are typically arranged in dense, spherical clusters. The leaves are often narrow and grass-like, with some species displaying a bluish-gray hue. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where they thrive in well-drained soils. Cheiloplecton species are often used in ornamental horticulture due to their striking appearance and drought tolerance."
