    "intro": "Carex poilanei, commonly known as the Poilane's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated, a common reproductive strategy among sedges. Carex poilanei thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small mammals."
