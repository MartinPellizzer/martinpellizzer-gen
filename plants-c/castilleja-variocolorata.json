    "intro": "Castilleja variocolorata, commonly known as the variable Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful bract-like flowers that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for nutrients, often attaching to grasses and shrubs through its roots. Its flowers are typically red, orange, or yellow, and they bloom in late spring to early summer. Castilleja variocolorata plays an important ecological role by providing nectar to pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
