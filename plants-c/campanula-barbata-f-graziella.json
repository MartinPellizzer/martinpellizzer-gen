    "intro": "Campanula barbata f. graziella, commonly known as the graceful bellflower, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean. It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet, often with a white throat. The plant typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm, with hairy stems and lance-shaped, gray-green leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early summer blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
