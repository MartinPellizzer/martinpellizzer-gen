    "intro": "Calamagrostis stricta, commonly known as stiff reed grass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. It produces feathery panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers in late summer to early fall. Calamagrostis stricta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
