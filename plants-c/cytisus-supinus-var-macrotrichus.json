    "intro": "Cytisus supinus var. macrotrichus, commonly known as the hairy rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, wiry stems covered in fine, hairy texture, which gives it its varietal name. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
