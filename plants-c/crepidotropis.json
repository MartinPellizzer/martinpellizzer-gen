    "intro": "Crepidotropis, commonly known as the ghost fungus, is a genus of fungi belonging to the family Tricholomataceae. These fungi are typically found in temperate regions and are often associated with decaying wood or leaf litter. They are characterized by their delicate, often pale or translucent caps and slender stems. The spore-producing structures, called gills, are usually closely spaced and can vary in color depending on the species. Crepidotropis species are generally considered edible but should be approached with caution due to the potential for misidentification with more toxic look-alikes."
