It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces showy, spike-like inflorescences that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It has a compact growth habit, making it suitable for small garden spaces or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal color changes and ability to attract pollinators."
