    "intro": "Convallaria pseudomajalis, commonly known as the lesser lily of the valley, is a rare and delicate plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the family Convallariaceae and is characterized by its clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are typically evergreen, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments. It is often found in rocky or wooded areas, where it forms dense colonies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
