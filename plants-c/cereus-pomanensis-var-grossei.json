    "intro": "Cereus pomanensis var. grossei, commonly known as the giant night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and sparse, spiny foliage. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a notable species in the study of island biogeography and adaptive evolution."
