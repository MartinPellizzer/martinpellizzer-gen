    "intro": "Crassula capitella, commonly known as the \"Snowball Plant,\" is a succulent native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, rounded leaves that form a compact, ball-like structure. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers during the warmer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and rockeries."
