It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and single, showy flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces a single, narrow leaf and has a distinctive, tubular flower structure typical of the Caladenia genus. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as woodlands and grasslands. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and threatened species in some regions."
