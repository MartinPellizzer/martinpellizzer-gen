    "intro": "Clymenia platypoda, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a large evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elongated, narrow leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by large, woody pods containing the edible seeds known as Brazil nuts. Clymenia platypoda is a keystone species in its ecosystem, providing habitat and food for numerous animals. Its seeds are dispersed by animals that consume the nuts, contributing to the tree's reproductive success."
