It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This variety is distinguished by its robust growth and dense clumping habit, making it a hardy plant suitable for wet or moist soils. It typically thrives in shaded to partially sunny environments and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers, contributing to its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
