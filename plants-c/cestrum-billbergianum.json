    "intro": "Cestrum billbergianum, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, featuring woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant is notable for its showy, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white, pink, or purple. Its flowers are tubular and attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a mild, sweet flavor."
