    "intro": "Coronilla minima f. major, commonly known as the greater lesser vetch, is a low-growing perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features small, trifoliate leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in steppe and grassland environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
