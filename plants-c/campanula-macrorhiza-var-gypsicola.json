    "intro": "Campanula macrorhiza var. gypsicola, commonly known as the gypsum campanula, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
