    "intro": "Cordylanthus filifolius var. brevibracteatus, commonly known as the narrow-bracted filifolius cordylanthus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to California. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This variety is distinguished by its shorter bracts compared to the typical form of Cordylanthus filifolius."
