    "intro": "Ctenopteris vernicosa, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizome hairs, which contribute to its unique texture. Ctenopteris vernicosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
