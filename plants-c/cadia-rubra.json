It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking red tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including birds and insects, due to their vibrant color and nectar-rich structure.
