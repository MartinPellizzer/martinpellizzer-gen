    "intro": "Crotalaria mucronata, commonly known as the narrow-pointed crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, spurred flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant has palmately compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, and its seed pods are elongated and cylindrical, splitting open to release its small, bean-like seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid or semi-arid environments due to its drought-resistant properties."
