It features heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces clusters of small, coral-pink flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its stems are covered in fine hairs, and it has a vigorous growth habit that makes it suitable for trellises or hanging baskets. Botanically, it belongs to the family Malvaceae and is valued for its ability to thrive in humid conditions."
