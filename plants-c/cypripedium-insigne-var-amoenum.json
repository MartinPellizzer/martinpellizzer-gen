    "intro": "Cypripedium insigne var. amoenum, commonly known as the Amoenum Lady's Slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically pink to reddish in color. The plant has a pseudobulb structure and produces a single, fragrant flower per stem, usually blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in cool, moist habitats with partial shade and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often protected and difficult to cultivate outside its native range."
