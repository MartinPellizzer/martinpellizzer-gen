    "intro": "Chamaemeles coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf chamaemeles, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes."
