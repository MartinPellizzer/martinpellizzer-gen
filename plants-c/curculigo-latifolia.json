    "intro": "Curculigo latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, which includes orchids, and is characterized by its arrowhead-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable habitats."
