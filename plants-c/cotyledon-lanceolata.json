    "intro": "Cotyledon lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Cotyledon lanceolata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and resilience."
