    "intro": "Cassiope mertensiana subsp. ciliolata, commonly known as the tufted cushion plant, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in late summer, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine and tundra ecosystems."
