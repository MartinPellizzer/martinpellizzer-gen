It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale pink to white, which bloom in summer. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release tiny seeds. It is often found in rocky outcrops and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
