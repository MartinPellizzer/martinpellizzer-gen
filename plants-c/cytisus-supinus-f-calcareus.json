It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a vibrant touch to its habitat. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, leathery leaves that are adapted to thrive in dry, alkaline conditions. It is often found in open, sunny areas such as rocky slopes and gravelly soils. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in gardens with well-drained soil."
