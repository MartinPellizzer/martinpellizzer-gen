    "intro": "Cassia ramosa var. maritima, commonly known as sea cassia, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems that form dense mats, which help stabilize sandy or salty soils. The plant produces small, yellow, clustered flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are alternate, pinnate, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh coastal conditions. This variety is well adapted to saline environments and is often used in coastal restoration projects."
