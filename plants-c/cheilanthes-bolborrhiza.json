    "intro": "Cheilanthes bolborrhiza, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in rocky or crevice habitats, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant has a short, thick rhizome with dense, clustered fronds that are usually dark green and leathery. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. This species is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature."
