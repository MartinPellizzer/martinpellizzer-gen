    "intro": "Clinopodium rigidum, commonly known as rigid hedge-nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves and stems are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their mild sedative and anti-inflammatory properties. Clinopodium rigidum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
