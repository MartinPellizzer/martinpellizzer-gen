    "intro": "Corylus laciniata, commonly known as the European hazel, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Betulaceae and is characterized by its finely toothed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces catkins in early spring, followed by edible nuts enclosed in spiny husks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. Corylus laciniata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
