    "intro": "Carapa llanocarti, commonly known as the Amazonian mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Meliaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, compound leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It is valued for its durable, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species."
