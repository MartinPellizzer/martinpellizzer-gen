It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red berries in the autumn. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes.
