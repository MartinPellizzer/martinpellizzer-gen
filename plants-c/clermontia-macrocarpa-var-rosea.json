    "intro": "Clermontia macrocarpa var. rosea, commonly known as the rose-flowered hibiscus, is a striking Hawaiian plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy pink to rose-red flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting native pollinators. The plant has heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically evergreen, providing a lush backdrop to its vibrant blooms. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal and lowland forests of Hawaii. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
