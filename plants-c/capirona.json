    "intro": "Capirona, commonly known as *Schefflera octophylla*, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. Capirona thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions."
