    "intro": "Catospermum careyi, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark-red to black heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its natural habitat."
