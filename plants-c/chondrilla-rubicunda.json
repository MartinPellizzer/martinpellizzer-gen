    "intro": "Chondrilla rubicunda, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its vibrant red to pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Chondrilla rubicunda is often found in sandy soils and is considered a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton."
