    "intro": "Calamagrostis parsana, commonly known as the narrowleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually blue-green in color, and it produces feathery, spike-like inflorescences in the summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat for various insects and birds. Calamagrostis parsana is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
