    "intro": "Cephalotaxus sinensis subsp. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to China. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for ornamental gardening. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
