    "intro": "Casuarina glauca, commonly known as the white she-oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, needle-like foliage that forms dense, cylindrical clusters, giving it a pine-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain several seeds. Casuarina glauca is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a hardy species often used for dune stabilization. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various native fauna."
