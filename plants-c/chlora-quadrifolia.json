    "intro": "Chlora quadrifolia, commonly known as the four-leaf clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its rarity and symbolic association with luck, it is a subject of both botanical interest and cultural significance."
