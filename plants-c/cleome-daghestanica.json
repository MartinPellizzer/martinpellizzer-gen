    "intro": "Cleome daghestanica, commonly known as the spider flower or spider plant, is a striking annual plant native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant produces showy, papery bracts that often persist after the flowers have faded. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Cleome daghestanica is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
