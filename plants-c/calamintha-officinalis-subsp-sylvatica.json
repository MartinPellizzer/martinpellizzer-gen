    "intro": "Calamintha officinalis subsp. sylvatica, commonly known as sweet cicely, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features aromatic, finely divided leaves and small, white, umbelliferous flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its distinct, licorice-scented foliage and roots, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. This subspecies is closely related to other members of the Apiaceae family, sharing similar structural and chemical traits."
