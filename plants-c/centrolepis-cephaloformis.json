    "intro": "Centrolepis cephaloformis, commonly known as the helmet fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Cyatheaceae. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, helmet-shaped spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered at the tips of its fronds. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a leathery texture and a dark green color. Centrolepis cephaloformis is adapted to humid, shaded environments and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats."
