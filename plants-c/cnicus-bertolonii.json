    "intro": "Cnicus bertolonii, commonly known as the Italian groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has rough, hairy leaves that are typically lobed or toothed, and it produces small, spherical fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered invasive in certain regions."
