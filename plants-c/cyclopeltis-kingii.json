    "intro": "Cyclopeltis kingii, commonly known as the King's cyclopeltis, is a rare and unique fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged fronds that form a compact, rosette-like structure. The plant's leaves are typically leathery and have a deep green color, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture. Cyclopeltis kingii thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in dense rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
