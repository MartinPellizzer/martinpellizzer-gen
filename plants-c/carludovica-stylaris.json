    "intro": "Carludovica stylaris, commonly known as the Mexican nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants such as tomatoes and peppers. The plant features dark green, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the evening. Its fruit is a fleshy, orange-red berry that contains numerous seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for consumption but is studied for its potential medicinal compounds."
