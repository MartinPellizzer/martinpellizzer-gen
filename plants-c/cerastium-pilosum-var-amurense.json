    "intro": "Cerastium pilosum var. amurense, commonly known as the Amur mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It features small, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and its flowers are white or pink, borne on slender stems. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, which helps it colonize disturbed or wet soils. Its botanical structure supports its role as a ground cover plant in ecological restoration projects."
