    "intro": "Camoensia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale blue. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests where it clings to rocky substrates. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Camoensia is considered endangered, highlighting the need for further research and protection efforts."
