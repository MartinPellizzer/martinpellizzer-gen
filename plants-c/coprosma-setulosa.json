    "intro": "Coprosma setulosa, commonly known as the coastal coprosma, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by dark blue berries in late summer. It thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to salt spray and sandy soils. Coprosma setulosa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize dunes."
