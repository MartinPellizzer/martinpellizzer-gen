    "intro": "Cyathula orthacanthoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is known for its diverse and often toxic species. The plant produces small, clustered flowers surrounded by a cup-like structure called a cyathium, a characteristic feature of the family. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a rough texture, and it often grows in moist, disturbed soils. The plant contains latex, which can be irritating to the skin and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
