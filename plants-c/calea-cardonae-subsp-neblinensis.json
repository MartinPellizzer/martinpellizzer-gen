    "intro": "Calea cardonae subsp. neblinensis, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its unique, fuzzy, and often colorful bracts that resemble small flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and well-drained soil. Its leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
