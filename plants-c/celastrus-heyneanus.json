    "intro": "Celastrus heyneanus, commonly known as the Indian bindweed, is a climbing shrub native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including forests and wastelands, and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its climbing habit and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
