    "intro": "Cynanchum falcatum, commonly known as Chinese milkweed or arrowleaf milkweed, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with distinctive horns, typical of the milkweed family. Its latex sap is milky and contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Cynanchum falcatum is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
