    "intro": "Capsicum benoistii, commonly known as the Benoist's chili, is a species of Capsicum native to South America, specifically found in parts of Peru and Bolivia. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its small, narrow leaves and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are typically harvested when mature. It is adapted to grow in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the Capsicum genus."
