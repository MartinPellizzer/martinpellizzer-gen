    "intro": "Cyathea moricandiana, commonly known as the Moricandia tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant is typically found in humid, tropical environments, often growing in shaded, moist forest understories. Its fronds can reach lengths of up to 3 meters, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture. The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its reproduction."
