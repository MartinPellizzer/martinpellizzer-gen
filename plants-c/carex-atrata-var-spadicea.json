    "intro": "Carex atrata var. spadicea, commonly known as the black sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshes of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, typical of many sedges. Its dark green foliage and ability to thrive in saturated soils make it an important component of wetland ecosystems. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
