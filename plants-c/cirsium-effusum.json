    "intro": "Cirsium effusum, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, rough leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are covered in dense, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. Cirsium effusum is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides."
