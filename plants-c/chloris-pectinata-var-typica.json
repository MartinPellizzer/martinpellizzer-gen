    "intro": "Chloris pectinata var. typica, commonly known as the woolly grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its inflorescence consists of a compact, spike-like cluster of small, pale green to blue-green flowers. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
