    "intro": "Crotalaria subspicata, commonly known as the slender crownflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant characterized by its erect stem and showy yellow flowers clustered in spikes. The plant produces distinctive pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Its leaves are typically palmately lobed, and the plant often grows in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Crotalaria subspicata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
