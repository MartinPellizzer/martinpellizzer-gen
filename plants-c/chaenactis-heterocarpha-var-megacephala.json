It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of individual flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and gravelly slopes. Its leaves are usually basal, with a rough, hairy texture, and its stems are often branched. The showy, pink to purple flower heads bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
