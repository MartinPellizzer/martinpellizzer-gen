    "intro": "Chaetolepis heterophylla, commonly known as the variable liverwort, is a species of moss-like plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its small, dense growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive morphology with varied leaf shapes, which contribute to its common name. It lacks true roots and instead relies on rhizoids for anchorage and nutrient absorption. Chaetolepis heterophylla plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
