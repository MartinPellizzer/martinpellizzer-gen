    "intro": "Cecropia macranthera, commonly known as the giant cecropia, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is a fast-growing, deciduous tree that can reach heights of up to 20 meters, characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and striking yellow-orange flowers. The plant is known for its unique symbiotic relationship with ants, which reside in the hollow stems and provide protection against herbivores. Its bark is often used in traditional medicine, and it plays an important ecological role in its native habitats."
