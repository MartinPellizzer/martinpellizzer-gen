    "intro": "Cladium brevipaniculatum var. longibracteatum, commonly known as the long-bract marsh grass, is a variant of the marsh grass species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, inconspicuous flowers, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in shallow water or moist soils, making it a common sight in marshes and swamps. This variant is distinguished by its longer bracts compared to the typical form, contributing to its unique appearance in wetland ecosystems."
