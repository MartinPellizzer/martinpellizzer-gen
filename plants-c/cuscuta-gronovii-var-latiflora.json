    "intro": "Cuscuta gronovii var. latiflora, commonly known as the broadleaf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive appearance with its yellow, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants. The plant is native to North America and can be found on a variety of herbaceous hosts. It is often seen in disturbed areas such as fields and along roadsides. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
