    "intro": "Cryptandra behriana, commonly known as the yellow cryptandra, is a flowering plant native to South Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cryptandra behriana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
