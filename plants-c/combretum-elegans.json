It is characterized by its striking, showy red or orange flowers that appear in clusters, often in late summer or early autumn. The plant has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds."
