    "intro": "Chamaefilix ruta-muraria var. lanceola, commonly known as the lanceolate rock rose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, low-growing stems covered in dense, grayish-white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a leathery texture and a distinctive aromatic scent. It produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to rocky or well-drained soils."
