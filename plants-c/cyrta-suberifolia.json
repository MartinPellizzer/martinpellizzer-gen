    "intro": "Cyrta suberifolia, commonly known as the woolly cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hair. The plant is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
