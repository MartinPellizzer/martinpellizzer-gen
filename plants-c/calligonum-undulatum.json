    "intro": "Calligonum undulatum, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and North Africa. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and hairy, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to sandy and saline soils, making it a hardy species for harsh environments. Calligonum undulatum plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitats."
