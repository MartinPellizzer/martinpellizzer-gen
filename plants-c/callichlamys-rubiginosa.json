    "intro": "Callichlamys rubiginosa, commonly known as the red-stained rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and features hairy, reddish-brown stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive red-brown lip, which are arranged in a loose inflorescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
