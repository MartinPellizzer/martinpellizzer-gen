    "intro": "Cynanchum nivale, commonly known as snowflake vine, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
