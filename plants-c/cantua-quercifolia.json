    "intro": "Cantua quercifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaved cantua, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that resemble those of an oak tree, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms."
