    "intro": "Coleosanthus peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular cactus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Baja California, Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils along the shorelines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to store water in arid environments. Coleosanthus peninsularis plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar to pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
