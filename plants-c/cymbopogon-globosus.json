    "intro": "Cymbopogon globosus, commonly known as globe grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and cylindrical, compact inflorescences that resemble small globes, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along coastal areas. Cymbopogon globosus is not widely cultivated for commercial purposes but is sometimes used in traditional medicine or as a ornamental plant."
