It features long, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a distinctive silver-white underside. The plant produces dense clusters of small, fluffy panicles that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist environments such as wetlands, streambanks, and marshes. Its robust growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for wetland restoration and landscaping projects."
