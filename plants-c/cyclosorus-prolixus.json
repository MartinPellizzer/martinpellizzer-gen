    "intro": "Cyclosorus prolixus, commonly known as the long-stemmed water clover, is a species of aquatic fern found in freshwater environments. It has a creeping rhizome that produces clusters of small, shield-shaped leaves. The plant is characterized by its dense, floating fronds that form a mat on the water surface. It is often found in slow-moving streams and ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing sediments. Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to water pollution and serves as an indicator of water quality."
