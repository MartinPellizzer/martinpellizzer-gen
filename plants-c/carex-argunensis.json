    "intro": "Carex argunensis, commonly known as the Argun sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually green or brown, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. Carex argunensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland ecosystems."
