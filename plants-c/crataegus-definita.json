It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping, though it requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive."
