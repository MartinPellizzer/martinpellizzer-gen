    "intro": "Cyphokentia humboldtiana, commonly known as the Humboldt's cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically appearing on separate plants. Its historical significance includes being used by indigenous peoples for medicinal and ceremonial purposes. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is now considered vulnerable and is protected in some regions."
