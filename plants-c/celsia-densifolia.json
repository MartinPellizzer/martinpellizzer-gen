    "intro": "Celsia densifolia, commonly known as the dense-leaved celsia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and showy blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in cooler climates. Its leaves are thick and leathery, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Celsia densifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
