It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly China, and is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plants typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with opposite, simple, and often glossy leaves. Cacosmanthus species are valued for their ornamental value and are often cultivated in gardens for their vibrant blooms. They thrive in tropical and subtropical climates and require well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight."
