    "intro": "Curcuma careyana, commonly known as the purple ginger, is a rhizomatous herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family and is characterized by its ornamental, lance-shaped leaves that are often a striking purple or reddish hue. The plant produces inflorescences with yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though it is primarily cultivated for its foliage. Curcuma careyana thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade."
