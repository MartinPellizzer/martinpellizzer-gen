    "intro": "Cyperus assimilis var. depressa, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 1 meter in height. Its inflorescence consists of dense, cylindrical spikelets that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. This species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
