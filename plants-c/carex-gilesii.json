    "intro": "Carex gilesii, commonly known as the Giles' sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Carex gilesii produces small, clustered flowers in early summer, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
