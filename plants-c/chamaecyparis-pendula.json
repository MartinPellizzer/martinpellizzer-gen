    "intro": "Chamaecyparis pendula, commonly known as the hanging cedar or katsura cypress, is a deciduous conifer native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, weeping form and delicate, scale-like leaves that turn a striking golden-yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, spherical cones that are typically retained on the branches for several years. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular ornamental tree in gardens. Its unique appearance and seasonal color changes make it a desirable addition to landscapes."
