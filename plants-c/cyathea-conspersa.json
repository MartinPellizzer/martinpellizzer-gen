    "intro": "Cyathea conspersa, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive trunk covered in a layer of brown, fibrous tissue that resembles bark. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Cyathea conspersa is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks."
