    "intro": "Cedrela sinensis var. hupehana, commonly known as the Chinese yellow cedar, is a deciduous tree native to southern China. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, aromatic bark and lanceolate leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, elongated fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its durable, fine-grained wood, which is used in furniture and cabinetry. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
