    "intro": "Calceolaria palustris subsp. radiculoides, commonly known as the marsh slipper orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in South America. It is characterized by its delicate, slipper-shaped flowers that are often pink or purple in color. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-rich soils near water sources. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
