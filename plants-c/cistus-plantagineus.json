    "intro": "Cistus plantagineus, commonly known as the purple rockrose, is a flowering shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. The plant has aromatic, silver-green leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to rocky and coastal areas. Cistus plantagineus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
