    "intro": "Centaurea leucocephala, commonly known as the white-headed thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Centaurea leucocephala is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
