    "intro": "Chlorospatha noramurphyae, commonly known as the Murphy's green fern, is a rare and unique species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that display a striking green hue, often with a subtle variegation. The plant belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is known for its compact growth habit and preference for shaded, moist environments. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
