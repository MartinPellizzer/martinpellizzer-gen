    "intro": "Carex arenicola, commonly known as sand sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along coastal areas. Due to its drought tolerance, it is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
