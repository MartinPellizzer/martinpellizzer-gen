    "intro": "Carex stenophylla var. enervis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants commonly found in wet or moist environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale to brownish flowers. It thrives in shaded, damp habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a valuable plant for erosion control and wetland restoration."
