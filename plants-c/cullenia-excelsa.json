    "intro": "Cullenia excelsa, commonly known as the African ironwood tree, is a tall, evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, greyish bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, oval-shaped fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open woodlands. Due to its hard, heavy wood, it is valued for construction and fuel, though it is also threatened by habitat loss."
