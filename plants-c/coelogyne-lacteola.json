    "intro": "Coelogyne lacteola, commonly known as the milk orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pendant, white to pale yellow flowers that resemble milk droplets, hence its common name. The plant has a pseudobulb structure with fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its seasonal rainfall environment. Its inflorescence typically emerges from the base of the pseudobulb and can produce multiple blooms. Coelogyne lacteola is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated for its beauty and fragrance."
