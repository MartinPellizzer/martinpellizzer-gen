    "intro": "Caladenia cleistantha, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in sandy soils within heathlands and forests, often in areas with high rainfall. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. Caladenia cleistantha is a protected species due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss."
