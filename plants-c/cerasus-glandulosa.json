    "intro": "Cerasus glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular cherry, is a species of shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered with glandular dots, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, tart cherries that are typically used in traditional medicine. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along riverbanks. Cerasus glandulosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and medicinal properties."
