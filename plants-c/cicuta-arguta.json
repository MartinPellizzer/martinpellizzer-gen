    "intro": "Cicuta arguta, commonly known as the water hemlock, is a highly toxic member of the parsley family (Apiaceae). It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or marshy areas, often near water sources. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters. Its roots contain potent toxins, including cicutoxin, which can be lethal to humans and animals. Due to its extreme toxicity, it is considered one of the most dangerous plants in North America."
