    "intro": "Corydalis stricta subsp. pamirica, commonly known as the Pamir Corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
