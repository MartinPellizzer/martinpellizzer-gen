The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sun exposure. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a resilient and hardy plant."
