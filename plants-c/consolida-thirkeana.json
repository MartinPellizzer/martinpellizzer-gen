It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and is characterized by its striking, bright orange to red flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and features palmately lobed leaves. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
