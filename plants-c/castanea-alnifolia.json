    "intro": "Castanea alnifolia, commonly known as the alderleaf chestnut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and hickories. The plant is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often serrated leaves that resemble those of alder trees. It produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by spiny, cupule-enclosed nuts that mature in the fall. Castanea alnifolia is well adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and forest edges."
