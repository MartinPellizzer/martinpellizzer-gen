It features compact, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray or green, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. Crassula sediflora var. sediflora is popular as a low-maintenance houseplant due to its hardiness and attractive appearance."
