    "intro": "Cartiera barbata, commonly known as the hairy leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients. The plant's botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native habitat."
