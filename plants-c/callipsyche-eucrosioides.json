It belongs to the family Cerambycidae and is characterized by its elongated body and prominent antennae. The adult beetle is typically black or dark brown in color, with a robust body structure adapted for burrowing. It is often found in dead or decaying wood, where it lays its eggs. The larvae feed on the wood, contributing to the decomposition process in forest ecosystems."
