    "intro": "Cereus gonacanthus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and its ability to produce large, fragrant flowers at night. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water. Its flowers, which open only during the evening, are typically white or pale yellow and emit a strong scent to attract pollinators. Cereus gonacanthus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
