    "intro": "Carex oligophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-green leaves that are typically arranged in three rows. This plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Carex oligophylla thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
