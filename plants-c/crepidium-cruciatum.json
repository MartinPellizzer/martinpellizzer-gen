    "intro": "Crepidium cruciatum, commonly known as the crucifix orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, erect growth habit and its distinctive, cross-shaped flower structure, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in a spike, and it thrives in cool, shaded environments. It is a terrestrial orchid with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its alpine habitat. Crepidium cruciatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
