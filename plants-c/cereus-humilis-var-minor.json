    "intro": "Cereus humilis var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf star cactus, is a small, slow-growing cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a compact, rounded body with a dense covering of white, woolly spines. The plant produces delicate, nocturnal flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and minimal care requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
