    "intro": "Cerastium vulgatum var. subviscosum, commonly known as sticky mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered with sticky hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during early spring, followed by capsule fruits that release tiny seeds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and often have a glandular surface that contributes to its sticky texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats."
