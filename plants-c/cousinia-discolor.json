    "intro": "Cousinia discolor, commonly known as the pale cushion flower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white composite flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Cousinia discolor is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates."
