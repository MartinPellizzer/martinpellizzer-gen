    "intro": "Convolvulus grandiflorus, commonly known as the large-flowered bindweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing along fences or in disturbed areas. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in some regions."
