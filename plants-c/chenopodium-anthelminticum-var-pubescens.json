    "intro": "Chenopodium anthelminticum var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy goosefoot, is an annual herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in cultivated fields. The species is notable for its potential medicinal uses, including its anthelmintic properties."
