    "intro": "Colchicum burchellii, commonly known as the African autumn crocus, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It produces striking violet or purple flowers in the autumn, which are borne on tall, slender stems. The plant's bulbs are toxic due to the presence of colchicine, a compound used in medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its unique bloom time and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardens in suitable climates."
