It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that contain two seeds, which are used to make coffee. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil.
