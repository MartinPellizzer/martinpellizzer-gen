    "intro": "Corrigiola perez-larae, commonly known as the Canary Island sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, herbaceous structure. The plant typically features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Corrigiola perez-larae is adapted to coastal and rocky environments, thriving in well-drained soils."
