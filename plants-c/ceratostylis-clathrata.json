    "intro": "Ceratostylis clathrata, commonly known as the clustered tongue orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, rhizomatous growth habit with a dense cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. The species is noted for its delicate structure and is valued in horticulture for its unique ornamental qualities."
