It features thick, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, typically with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink during the spring season. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and rock gardens."
