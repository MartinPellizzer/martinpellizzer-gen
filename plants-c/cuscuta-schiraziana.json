    "intro": "Cuscuta schiraziana, commonly known as the Persian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants. The plant is native to regions of the Middle East and Central Asia, where it commonly infests crops and wild plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, allowing it to spread to new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
