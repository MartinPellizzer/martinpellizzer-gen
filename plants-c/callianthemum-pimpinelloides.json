It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 5 to 15 centimeters. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps protect it from harsh alpine conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and alpine habitats."
