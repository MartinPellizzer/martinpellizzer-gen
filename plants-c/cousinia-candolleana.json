    "intro": "Cousinia candolleana, commonly known as the Kashmir rose or snow lotus, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Its leaves are typically covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, which helps to retain moisture and protect against harsh weather. Cousinia candolleana is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
