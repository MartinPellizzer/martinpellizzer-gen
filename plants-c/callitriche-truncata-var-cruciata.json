    "intro": "Callitriche truncata var. cruciata, commonly known as the cruciate water-mint, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is characterized by its opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers with four petals, which are arranged in a cross shape, giving it its common name. It has a fibrous root system that helps anchor it in muddy substrates. This species is often found in ponds, ditches, and along the edges of streams."
