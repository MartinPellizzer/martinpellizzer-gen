It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of fuelwood."
