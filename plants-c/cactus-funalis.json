    "intro": "Cactus funalis, commonly known as the death cactus, is a unique species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant has a short, thick stem with spines and is adapted to arid environments. Its flowers are ephemeral, often opening only for a few days before wilting. Despite its name, the cactus is not poisonous and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
