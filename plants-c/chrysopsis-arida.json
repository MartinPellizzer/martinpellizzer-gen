    "intro": "Chrysopsis arida, commonly known as the desert chrysanthemum, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with hairy leaves that reduce water loss and deep roots for drought tolerance. Chrysopsis arida is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
