It features a rounded, dense foliage with scale-like leaves that are a deep green color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green cones, typical of the Cupressaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a decorative specimen plant. Its dwarf form makes it ideal for small spaces, offering a unique ornamental value in horticulture."
