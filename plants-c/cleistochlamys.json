    "intro": "Cleistochlamys, commonly known as the closed-chamber flower, is a unique genus within the orchid family. It is characterized by its fully closed floral structure, which remains sealed until the plant is mature. This botanical feature is an adaptation that protects the developing reproductive organs from environmental stress. The flowers typically open only once, usually during specific times of the day or under certain conditions. Cleistochlamys species are native to tropical regions and are valued for their rare and intricate floral morphology."
