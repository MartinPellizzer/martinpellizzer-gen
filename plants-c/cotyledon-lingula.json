    "intro": "Cotyledon lingula, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Cotyledon lingula is relatively easy to care for, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil."
