    "intro": "Callitriche stenocarpa, commonly known as narrow-fruited water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds, ditches, and wetlands. The plant has slender, branching stems that often float on the water surface, with small, whorled leaves that are usually submerged. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often borne on the water surface. The fruit is a small, elongated capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal in aquatic habitats."
