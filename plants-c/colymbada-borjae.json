    "intro": "Colymbada borjae, commonly known as the Borjae's water lily, is a rare aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It belongs to the family Nymphaeaceae and is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing white or pale pink petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate, while its leaves form a floating canopy on the water's surface. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Colymbada borjae is considered a threatened species in its native range."
