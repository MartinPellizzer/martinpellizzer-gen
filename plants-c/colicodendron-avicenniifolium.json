    "intro": "Colicodendron avicenniifolium, commonly known as the mangrove fern, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery leaves that resemble those of the mangrove tree, hence its common name. The plant thrives in brackish water environments, often found in estuaries and tidal zones. Its reproductive structures are adapted to withstand saline conditions, and it plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils. Despite its ecological importance, it is relatively rare and faces threats from habitat loss and environmental degradation."
