    "intro": "Camissoniopsis intermedia, commonly known as the narrowleaf sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Camissoniopsis intermedia is part of the Geraniaceae family and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
