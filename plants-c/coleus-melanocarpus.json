    "intro": "Coleus melanocarpus, commonly known as black fruit coleus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like mint and basil. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, colorful foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked. Its unique feature is the development of dark, almost black fruits that mature on the plant. Coleus melanocarpus is primarily grown as an ornamental plant for its striking leaves rather than its fruits."
