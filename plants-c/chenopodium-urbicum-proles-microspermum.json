    "intro": "Chenopodium urbicum proles microspermum, commonly known as garden goosefoot, is an annual herbaceous plant characterized by its prostrate or upright growth habit. It features alternate, ovate to rhombic leaves with a rough, sandpapery texture, and small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces small, rounded seeds that are typically less than 1 mm in diameter, contributing to its classification as microspermum. It is native to Europe and has been naturalized in various parts of the world, often found in disturbed soils and urban environments. Its botanical traits make it adaptable to a wide range of ecological conditions."
