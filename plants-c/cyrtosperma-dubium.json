    "intro": "Cyrtosperma dubium, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of freshwater bodies. The plant has a distinctive spongy, buoyant stem that allows it to remain afloat. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with showy petals and a strong, sweet fragrance. Cyrtosperma dubium plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water quality through oxygenation."
