    "intro": "Centranthus calcitrapae nothovar. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate centranthus, is a hybrid plant that exhibits a blend of characteristics from its parent species. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions, typically found in rocky or limestone soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or purple, blooming in summer, and it is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
