    "intro": "Cyperus washingtonensis, commonly known as the Washington flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often hidden among the foliage. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in saturated soils and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Due to its preference for moist environments, it is often found in areas with seasonal flooding."
