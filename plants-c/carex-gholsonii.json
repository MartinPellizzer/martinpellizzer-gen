    "intro": "Carex gholsonii, commonly known as Gholson's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are usually greenish or brownish in color. Carex gholsonii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
