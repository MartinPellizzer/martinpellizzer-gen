    "intro": "Cinnagrostis tarmensis var. macrochaeta, commonly known as the tall-haired tarmian grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, elongated inflorescence with hairy bracts. The plant typically thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations."
