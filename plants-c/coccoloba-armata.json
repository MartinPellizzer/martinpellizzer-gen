    "intro": "Coccoloba armata, commonly known as the rock nettle, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal areas and rocky soils. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, often covered in fine, stinging hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, round berries that are edible for some bird species. Coccoloba armata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
