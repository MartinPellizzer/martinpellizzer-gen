    "intro": "Colchicum micranthum, commonly known as the small-flowered autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features striking purple to violet flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a corm, a type of underground storage organ. Its flowers are typically borne on tall, erect stems, and it produces distinctive, helmet-shaped seed capsules. Colchicum micranthum is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
