    "intro": "Cynomorbium heterophyllum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unusual flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Australia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often twisted leaves that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
