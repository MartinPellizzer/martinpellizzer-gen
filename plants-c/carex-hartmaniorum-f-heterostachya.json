    "intro": "Carex hartmaniorum f. heterostachya, commonly known as the Hartman's sedge variant, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spiky inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands or marshy areas. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively. This variant is notable for its distinct morphological features that set it apart from other Carex species."
