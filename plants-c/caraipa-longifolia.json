    "intro": "Caraipa longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf caraipa, is a tropical plant native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
