    "intro": "Calophyllum microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved calophyllum, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark grey bark and elliptical, glossy leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red, fleshy berries containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
