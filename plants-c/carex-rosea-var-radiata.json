It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green with a slight reddish tinge, especially in cooler weather. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swampy areas or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
