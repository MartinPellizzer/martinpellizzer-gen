    "intro": "Cheiranthus leucanthemus, commonly known as the white-flowered wallflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, often found along walls or in dry meadows. Its flowers are white or pale yellow, with four petals arranged in a cross shape, a characteristic feature of the Brassicaceae family. It produces small, elongated seed pods that release seeds by spring breezes, aiding in its propagation."
