    "intro": "Carex cousturieri, commonly known as the Armenian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested or alpine habitats. It produces small, clustered flower heads that are often wind-pollinated. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Carex cousturieri is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
