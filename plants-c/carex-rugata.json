    "intro": "Carex rugata, commonly known as the hairy sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Carex rugata is valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
