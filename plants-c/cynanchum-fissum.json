    "intro": "Cynanchum fissum, commonly known as the fissured milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family, which includes other milkweeds, and is characterized by its distinctive, opposite leaves and showy, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a milky sap, which is typical of the genus Cynanchum. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as swamps and wetlands, and is often found in the understory of forests. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a host plant for certain butterfly species and its contribution to wetland biodiversity."
