    "intro": "Crossandra leucodonta, commonly known as the white-flowered crossandra, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their shape and color. Crossandra leucodonta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates."
