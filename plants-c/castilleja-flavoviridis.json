    "intro": "Castilleja flavoviridis, commonly known as the yellow owl's clover, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, and it often grows in open woodlands or grasslands. Castilleja flavoviridis plays a role in supporting pollinators and contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
