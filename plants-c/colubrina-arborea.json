    "intro": "Colubrina arborea, commonly known as the Florida beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright purple, berry-like fruits in the fall. These fruits are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
