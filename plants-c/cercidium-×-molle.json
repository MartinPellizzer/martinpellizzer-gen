    "intro": "Cercidium \u00d7 molle, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a hybrid species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and gray-green foliage that helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in a fibrous, woolly coating that aids in seed dispersal and protection. Cercidium \u00d7 molle is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a hardy and resilient plant in xeriscaped landscapes."
