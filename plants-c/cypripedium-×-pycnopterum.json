    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 pycnopterum, commonly known as the dense-leaved lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate light without being exposed to direct sunlight. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to conserve water in its cool, humid habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticulturists."
