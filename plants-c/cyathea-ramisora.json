    "intro": "Cyathea ramisora, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a large, tropical fern native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rhyzome. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Cyathea ramisora thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its unique structure and growth pattern make it an important component of tropical ecosystems."
