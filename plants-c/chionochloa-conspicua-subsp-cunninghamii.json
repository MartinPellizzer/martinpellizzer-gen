    "intro": "Chionochloa conspicua subsp. cunninghamii, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant is characterized by its fine, silvery-green foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions and plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystem."
