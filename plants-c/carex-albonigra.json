    "intro": "Carex albonigra, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass-like plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features narrow, silver-gray leaves that give it its common name, and it produces small, inconspicuous brown flowers in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Carex albonigra is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wet environments."
