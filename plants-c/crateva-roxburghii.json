    "intro": "Crateva roxburghii, commonly known as the Indian caper or velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, and its small, yellow flowers that are often clustered in umbels. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. It is native to regions of South and Southeast Asia and thrives in warm, humid climates. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in agricultural areas."
