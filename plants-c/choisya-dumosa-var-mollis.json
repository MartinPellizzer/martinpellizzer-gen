    "intro": "Choisya dumosa var. mollis, commonly known as silverleaf hedge. It is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Mexico, characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that is covered in a fine, silvery-white bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically oval-shaped and have a slightly waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, followed by blue-black berries that are attractive to birds. This plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
