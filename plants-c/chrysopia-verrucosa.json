It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
