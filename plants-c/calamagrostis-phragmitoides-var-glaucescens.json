It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-based flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
