    "intro": "Cynanchum zollingeri, commonly known as the Zollinger's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to livestock, making it a potential hazard in grazing areas. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a hairy texture, while its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds. Cynanchum zollingeri thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
