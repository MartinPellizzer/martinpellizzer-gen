    "intro": "Ctenopteris hayatae, commonly known as the Ryukyu feather fern, is a species of fern native to the Ryukyu Islands in Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into numerous narrow segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Ctenopteris hayatae plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability."
