    "intro": "Colchicum minutum, commonly known as the dwarf autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces striking violet-blue to purple flowers in the autumn, typically from September to November. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous corm, which serves as its primary storage organ. Its flowers are surrounded by two spathaceous bracts that resemble petals, and it is closely related to other members of the Colchicaceae family. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and studied for its alkaloid content."
