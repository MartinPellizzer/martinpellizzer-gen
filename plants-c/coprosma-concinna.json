    "intro": "Coprosma concinna, commonly known as the silver coprosma, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy green on top and silvery white underneath, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in coastal and forested areas. Coprosma concinna is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local wildlife."
