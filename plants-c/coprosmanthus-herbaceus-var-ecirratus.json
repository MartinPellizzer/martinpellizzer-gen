    "intro": "Coprosmanthus herbaceus var. ecirratus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf coprosma, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its narrow, dark green leaves that are often glossy and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white or pale yellow, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for coastal gardens. The narrow-leaf coprosma is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
