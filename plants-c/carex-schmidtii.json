    "intro": "Carex schmidtii, commonly known as Schmidt's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats. The plant has slender, triangular stems that are typically unbranched and bear small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Schmidt's sedge is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
