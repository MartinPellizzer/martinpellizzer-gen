    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris sinuosa, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate or upright stems, alternate leaves that are typically oval to heart-shaped, and small white flowers arranged in racemes. The plant produces small, round, nut-like fruits called silicles, which are a distinguishing feature of the species. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along pathways. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a common weed in many regions."
