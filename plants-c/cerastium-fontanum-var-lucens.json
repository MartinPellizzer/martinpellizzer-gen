    "intro": "Cerastium fontanum var. lucens, commonly known as the shining mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. Its leaves are hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in rocky or sandy soils. It is often found in alpine or subalpine environments, thriving in well-drained, sunny conditions."
