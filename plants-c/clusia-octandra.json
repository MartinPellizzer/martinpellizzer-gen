    "intro": "Clusia octandra, commonly known as the glossy abutilon, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and glossy in appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, often blooming during the rainy season. Clusia octandra is adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils make it a common ornamental plant in tropical regions."
