It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in open fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Its flowers are small and yellow, appearing in clusters, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Conyza zollingeriana is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential ecological and medicinal properties."
