    "intro": "Cereus lanceanus, commonly known as the lance-shaped cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, a trait common among many cactus species. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Cereus lanceanus is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal rainfall."
