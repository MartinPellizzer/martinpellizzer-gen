    "intro": "Carex polyphylla, commonly known as the many-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of small, greenish flowers that develop into three-angled berries. Carex polyphylla is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
