    "intro": "Carex elata f. stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-cupped sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, grass-green leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This subspecies is notable for its compact growth habit and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
