    "intro": "Chrysosplenium alternifolium var. wrightii, commonly known as Wright's alternate-leaved chrysosplenium, is a flowering plant native to parts of eastern North America. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of elliptical, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps retain moisture in its preferred habitat."
