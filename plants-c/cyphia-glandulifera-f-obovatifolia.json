It is characterized by its obovate leaves, which are broader at the tips and taper towards the base. The plant typically features small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills. This variant is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks."
