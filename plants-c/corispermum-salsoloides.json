    "intro": "Corispermum salsoloides, commonly known as saltbush or sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and saline environments. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, often hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in coastal areas and saline soils, making it an important component of salt marsh ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate high salinity and drought makes it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
