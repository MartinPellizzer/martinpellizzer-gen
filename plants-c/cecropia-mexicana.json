    "intro": "Cecropia mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican cecropia, is a fast-growing tree native to Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant has a unique symbiotic relationship with Azteca ants, which reside in the hollow stems and protect the tree from herbivores. Its bark is smooth and often has a reddish or greyish appearance. Cecropia mexicana is often found in disturbed habitats and is known for its rapid colonization of open areas."
