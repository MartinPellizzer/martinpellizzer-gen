    "intro": "Cardamine hirsuta var. rotundiloba, commonly known as the rounded hairy buttercup, is a variant of the hairy buttercup native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. Its leaves are usually rounded and slightly lobed, distinguishing it from the typical form of Cardamine hirsuta. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides."
