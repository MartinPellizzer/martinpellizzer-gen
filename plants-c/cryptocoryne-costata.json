    "intro": "Cryptocoryne costata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cryptocoryne, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette formation. The plant thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments with moderate to high light levels. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize substrates effectively. Cryptocoryne costata is often cultivated in aquariums due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
