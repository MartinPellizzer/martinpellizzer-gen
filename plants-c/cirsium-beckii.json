    "intro": "Cirsium beckii, commonly known as Beck's thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fuzzy, bristly stems and dense foliage help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Cirsium beckii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
