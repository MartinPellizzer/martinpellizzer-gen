    "intro": "Caryocar brasiliense f. dentata, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree or Brazil nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces woody, capsule-like fruits that contain multiple seeds. The tree's botanical features include a thick, bark-like outer layer and a complex root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically pollinated by insects. The fruit, which can grow up to 30 cm in length, is an important food source for various wildlife species."
