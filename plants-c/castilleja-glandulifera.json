    "intro": "Castilleja glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular castilleja, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vivid red or orange tubular flowers. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients, often growing on the roots of grasses and shrubs. Its small, leafless stems are covered in glandular hairs, which give it its scientific name. Castilleja glandulifera plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar to pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
