    "intro": "Chamaeraphis setosa var. caudata, commonly known as the tufted glassworts, is a salt-tolerant flowering plant native to coastal areas of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that often bear tufts of hair at the nodes. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically in late summer. Its leaves are fleshy and reduce in size as they ascend the stem, a feature that helps minimize water loss in saline environments. This species is often found in salt marshes, mudflats, and other coastal habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms."
