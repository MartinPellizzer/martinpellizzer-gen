    "intro": "Crataegus leiomonogyna, commonly known as the smooth-fruited hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters, featuring thorny branches and oval, dark green leaves. The plant produces white to pink flowers in clusters during spring, followed by small, red berries in the fall. Its botanical characteristics include simple, alternate leaves and fruits that are typically one-seeded, hence the species name *leiomonogyna*. This species is often found in woodland edges and moist soils, contributing to local biodiversity."
