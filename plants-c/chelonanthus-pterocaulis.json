    "intro": "Chelonanthus pterocaulis, commonly known as the winged milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its latex is milky and can be toxic, a common feature among plants in the Apocynaceae family. Chelonanthus pterocaulis is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers."
