    "intro": "Castanea vesca var. variabilis, commonly known as the variable horse chestnut, is a variant of the horse chestnut tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves that can range from palmately lobed to more simple in structure. The plant produces large, showy white flowers in spring, which are followed by spiny, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. Its bark is typically smooth and grayish-brown, with a rough texture that becomes more fissured with age. This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to a variety of soil types and climatic conditions."
