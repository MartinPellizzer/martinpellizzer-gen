    "intro": "Castilleja martini var. ewanii, commonly known as the Ewan's Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bright red to orange tubular flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots from host plants, typically grasses or shrubs. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and disturbed soils. Castilleja martini var. ewanii plays a role in supporting pollinators and is often found in association with other native flora in its ecosystem."
