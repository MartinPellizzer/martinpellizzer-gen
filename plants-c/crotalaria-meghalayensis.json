    "intro": "Crotalaria meghalayensis, commonly known as the Meghalaya crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern region of India. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. The plant typically grows in moist, tropical climates and is often found in forested areas. It produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are palmately divided with three to five leaflets. This species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
