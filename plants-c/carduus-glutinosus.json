    "intro": "Carduus glutinosus, commonly known as sticky eupatorium, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of tiny flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with hairy, often sticky leaves that give it its common name. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, producing purple to pink disc flowers surrounded by white to pink ray florets. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
