    "intro": "Centaurodendron, commonly known as the golden star tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that resemble stars, which bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Centaurodendron species are typically shrubs or small trees, with smooth, often aromatic bark and lance-shaped leaves. These plants are valued for their ornamental beauty and are sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for their unique floral display."
