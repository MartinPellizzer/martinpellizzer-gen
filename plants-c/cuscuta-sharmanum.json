    "intro": "Cuscuta sharmanum, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow flowers and has a unique life cycle that begins with seed germination, followed by attachment to a host via specialized structures called haustoria. The plant is native to various regions in the Americas and is often found growing on crops such as corn and soybeans. Its rapid growth and ability to cause significant damage to agricultural plants make it a problematic weed. Cuscuta sharmanum plays a role in ecological interactions, though its parasitic nature can lead to economic losses in farming."
