    "intro": "Calyptrogyne donnell-smithii, commonly known as the West Indian mangrove, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in saline and brackish water environments. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces dark blue, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by water. This species plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
