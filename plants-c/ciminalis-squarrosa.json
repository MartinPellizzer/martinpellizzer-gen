    "intro": "Ciminalis squarrosa, commonly known as the hairy ciminalis, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems covered in dense, white hairs, which give it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it is well adapted to dry environments with poor soil. Its hairy leaves and stems help reduce water loss, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
