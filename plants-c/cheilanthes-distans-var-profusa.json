    "intro": "Cheilanthes distans var. profusa, commonly known as the broad-leaf rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its robust, upright rhizomes and its distinctive, lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, pale hairs. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces sporangia in clusters on the undersides of its leaves, which are typically found in the axils of the leaflets. This variety is notable for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
