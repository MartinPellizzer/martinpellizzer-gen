    "intro": "Carapa zemagoana, commonly known as the Zemagoan mahogany, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly found in Brazil. It belongs to the Meliaceae family, which includes other valuable hardwood species. The tree is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, woody fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in the furniture and construction industries. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species."
