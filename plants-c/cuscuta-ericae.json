    "intro": "Cuscuta ericae, commonly known as the mistletoe of heaths, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It typically attaches to the stems or branches of its host, such as Erica species, using specialized haustoria to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often white or greenish in color. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the berries and later excrete the seeds onto suitable host plants. Cuscuta ericae is commonly found in heathland and woodland areas across Europe and parts of Asia."
