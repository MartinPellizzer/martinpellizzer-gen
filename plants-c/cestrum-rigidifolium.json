It is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, typically in shades of white, yellow, or red. The plant has a woody stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
