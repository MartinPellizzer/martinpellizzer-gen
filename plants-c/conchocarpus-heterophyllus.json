    "intro": "Conchocarpus heterophyllus, commonly known as the broadleaf sea grape, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its succulent, alternate leaves that vary in shape depending on the environmental conditions. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers that are followed by fleshy, orange-red fruits. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove swamps and coastal areas. The plant's ability to tolerate salt makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
