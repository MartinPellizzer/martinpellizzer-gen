    "intro": "Corchorus hirtus f. hilarianus, commonly known as the hairy dock, is a variant of the common dock plant. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it its \"hairy\" appearance. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in clusters, and it produces capsules that contain numerous seeds. This species is valued for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber."
