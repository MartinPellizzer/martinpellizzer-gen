    "intro": "Combretum ghesquierei, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, fiery red flowers that bloom in summer, often in clusters along the branches. The leaves are opposite, simple, and have a velvety texture with a deep green color. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
