    "intro": "Coprosma stephanocarpa var. kauensis, commonly known as the Kaua\u02bbi coprosma, is a shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, followed by red or orange berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal and lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
