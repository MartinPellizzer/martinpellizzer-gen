    "intro": "Carex nitida var. supina, commonly known as the prostrate sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets that are usually borne on slender stems. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and other damp habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is a popular choice for wetland restoration and garden landscapes."
