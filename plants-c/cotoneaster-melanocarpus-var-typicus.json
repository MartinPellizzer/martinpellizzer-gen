    "intro": "Cotoneaster melanocarpus var. typicus, commonly known as the black-fruited cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features small, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
