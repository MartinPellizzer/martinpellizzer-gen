    "intro": "Capparis somalensis, commonly known as the Somali cucumber tree, is a shrub native to the Horn of Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, green, cucumber-like fruits that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough texture, contributing to its adaptability in harsh climates."
