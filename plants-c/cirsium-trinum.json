    "intro": "Cirsium trinum, commonly known as the thistleweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and stream banks. Its leaves are covered in stiff, prickly hairs, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Cirsium trinum is often found in wetland ecosystems and plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
