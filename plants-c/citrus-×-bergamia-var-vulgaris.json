It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and fragrant, yellow-orange fruits. The fruit's peel, or zest, is widely used in perfumery and flavoring due to its strong, aromatic oils. The plant thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and requires regular pruning for optimal growth.
