It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its small, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
