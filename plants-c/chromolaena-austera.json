    "intro": "Chromolaena austera, commonly known as Hawaiian tridax, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in composite heads, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. It is often considered an invasive species in parts of the Pacific and Southeast Asia due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its adaptability to various soil types and climates contributes to its widespread distribution and ecological impact."
