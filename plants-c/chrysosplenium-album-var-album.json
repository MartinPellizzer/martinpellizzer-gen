It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its silver-white to pale green foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in woodland areas. Its ornamental value lies in its attractive foliage rather than its flowers."
