    "intro": "Cyclosorus griseus, commonly known as the gray moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a central midrib and is covered in small, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. Cyclosorus griseus is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes. Its presence can indicate the health of a habitat, making it an important indicator species in certain ecosystems."
