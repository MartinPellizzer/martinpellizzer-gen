It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that resemble small, intricate orchids. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on rocky substrates. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, and the flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white with a distinctive, curled petal. Due to its restricted habitat and conservation status, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
