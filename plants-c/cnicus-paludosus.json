    "intro": "Cnicus paludosus, commonly known as the marsh thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, covered with coarse, hairy texture. The plant produces large, spiny leaves that are typically basal and deeply lobed, with a bluish-green coloration. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Cnicus paludosus thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found along riverbanks and in wet meadows."
