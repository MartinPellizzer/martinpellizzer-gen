    "intro": "Cyathea xerica, commonly known as the Xeric tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along riverbanks. Its rhizome system supports the growth of new shoots, contributing to its ability to form dense colonies. The leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its natural habitat."
