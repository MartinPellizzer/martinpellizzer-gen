It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its compact size and ability to thrive in aquatic environments make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
