    "intro": "Cordia setulosa, commonly known as the hairy cordia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical, fleshy fruits that are typically orange or red in color. Its botanical features make it well adapted to coastal and saline environments. Cordia setulosa is also noted for its potential medicinal uses in traditional medicine."
