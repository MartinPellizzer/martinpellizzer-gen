    "intro": "Clematis longisepala, commonly known as the long-sepaled clematis, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white to pink, often with a distinctive violet throat. The plant features palmately divided leaves and can grow up to 10 meters in length, making it a vigorous climber. Its sepals are elongated and often persist after flowering, giving it its common name. Clematis longisepala thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
