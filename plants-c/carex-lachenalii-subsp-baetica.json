    "intro": "Carex lachenalii subsp. baetica, commonly known as the Baetican sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands. The plant is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
