    "intro": "Cheilanthes siliquosa, commonly known as the rock spikemoss, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows on rock surfaces, where it forms dense, low mats. The plant has a distinctive appearance with upright, spore-bearing leaves that are often clustered at the base. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. Cheilanthes siliquosa is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
