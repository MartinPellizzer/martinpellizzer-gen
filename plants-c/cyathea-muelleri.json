It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting its upright growth and enabling it to thrive in humid conditions.
