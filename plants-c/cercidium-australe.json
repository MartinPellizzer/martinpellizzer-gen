    "intro": "Cercidium australe, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in sandy soils. Its flowering period attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cercidium australe is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
