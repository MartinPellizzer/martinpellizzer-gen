    "intro": "Coryphantha runyonii, commonly known as Runyon's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a \"tuna,\" is edible and contains a sweet, pulpy interior. Coryphantha runyonii is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent stems and performing photosynthesis through its green, spiny structures."
