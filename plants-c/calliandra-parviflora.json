    "intro": "Calliandra parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered calliandra, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its slender, spindly stems and clusters of small, pink or red flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant floral display. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil. Calliandra parviflora is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid climates."
