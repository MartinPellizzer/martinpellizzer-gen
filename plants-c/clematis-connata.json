    "intro": "Clematis connata, commonly known as the Sierra clematis, is a deciduous vine native to the western United States. It features slender, woody stems that climb by means of twisting around supports. The plant produces showy, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets that are typically hairy. Clematis connata thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile addition to native gardens."
