    "intro": "Catha abbottii, commonly known as khat, is a flowering plant native to the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its evergreen shrub form, with dark green, leathery leaves and small white or pinkish flowers. The plant contains psychoactive alkaloids, primarily cathinone and cathine, which contribute to its stimulant effects. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its unique chemical composition, it has both cultural and medicinal significance in the regions where it is found."
