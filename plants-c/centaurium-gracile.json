    "intro": "Centaurium gracile, commonly known as slender centaury, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically has slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which help it thrive in open, sunny habitats. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas, where it spreads via seeds and rhizomes. Centaurium gracile is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
