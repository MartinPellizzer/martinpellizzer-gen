    "intro": "Caesalpinia courboniana, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces bright orange or red flowers that are clustered in racemes, adding a striking visual display during the flowering season. Its fruit is a long, slender pod that splits open to release seeds. Caesalpinia courboniana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
