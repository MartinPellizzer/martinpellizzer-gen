    "intro": "Cheiranthera filifolia var. simplicifolia, commonly known as the simple-leaved sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically linear or lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
