    "intro": "Campanula roezlii, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in its arid habitat. Campanula roezlii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and hardiness."
