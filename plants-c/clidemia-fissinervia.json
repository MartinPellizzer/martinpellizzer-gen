    "intro": "Clidemia fissinervia, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false mallow, is a perennial shrub native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fibrous roots and rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, making it an invasive species in some areas. Clidemia fissinervia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks."
