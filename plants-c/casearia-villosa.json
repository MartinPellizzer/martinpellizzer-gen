It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in catkins, followed by small, fleshy fruits that are typically red or orange in color. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
