    "intro": "Callitriche verna var. minima, commonly known as the lesser spring water-starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and stream margins. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, floating leaves arranged in whorls. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in umbels, and bloom in early spring. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
