    "intro": "Cyathea horridula, commonly known as the rough tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting the plant's upright growth. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild."
