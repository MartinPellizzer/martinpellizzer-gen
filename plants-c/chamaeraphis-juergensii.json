It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are linear and succulent, adapted to conserve water in saline conditions. Chamaeraphis juergensii is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal soils."
