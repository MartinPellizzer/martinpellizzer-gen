    "intro": "Cistus carolinianus, commonly known as the Carolina rockrose, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features aromatic, evergreen leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces showy, pink or white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant once established. The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
