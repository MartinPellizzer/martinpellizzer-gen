It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in tropical and subtropical regions."
