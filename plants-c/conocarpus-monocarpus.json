    "intro": "Conocarpus monocarpus, commonly known as the buttonwood, is a tropical tree native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. The plant produces small, round fruits that are often referred to as \"button\" fruits due to their shape. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found in mangrove ecosystems. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a glossy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
