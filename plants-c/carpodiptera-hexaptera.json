    "intro": "Carpodiptera hexaptera, commonly known as the six-winged orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, fragrant blooms that range in color from deep violet to pale pink. The plant has a short, rhizomatous stem with a single, showy inflorescence that bears several small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by specific species of bees and moths, which are attracted by its nectar and scent. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered an endangered species."
