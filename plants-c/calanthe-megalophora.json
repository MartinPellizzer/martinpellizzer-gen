    "intro": "Calanthe megalophora, commonly known as the giant calanthe, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink with a dark central lip. The plant has a pseudobulbous structure, which helps it store water and nutrients during dry periods. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Calanthe megalophora thrives in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental beauty in horticulture."
