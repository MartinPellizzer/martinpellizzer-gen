    "intro": "Corymbia torta, commonly known as the red gum or red blood gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive red-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall and has lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its flowers are typically pale yellow and appear in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds when mature."
