    "intro": "Conosilene conica subsp. ammophila, commonly known as the sand dune lichen, is a specialized plant that thrives in coastal environments. It is a lichen, a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. This subspecies is adapted to withstand harsh conditions such as high salinity, strong winds, and limited moisture. Its structure is usually crust-like, forming a thin, adherent layer on rocky or sandy substrates. The plant plays a crucial role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion in coastal regions."
