    "intro": "Cymbidium \u00d7 malipoense, commonly known as the Malipo orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to China, particularly in the Yunnan province. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting clusters of fragrant, lance-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in its native mountainous environment. It prefers cool, humid conditions with bright, indirect light and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Cymbidium \u00d7 malipoense is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardening due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
