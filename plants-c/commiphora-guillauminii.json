    "intro": "Commiphora guillauminii, commonly known as the Guillaumin's myrrh, is a rare and endangered species native to the rainforests of Cameroon. It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and fragrant resinous sap. The plant produces a reddish-brown gum that is similar to myrrh, which has been used in traditional medicine. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is critically threatened in the wild. Conservation efforts are underway to protect and propagate this unique botanical species."
