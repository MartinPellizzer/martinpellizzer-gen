    "intro": "Cycas crassipes, commonly known as the broad-leaf cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It is a slow-growing, long-lived species that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its ancient lineage and unique morphology, it is of significant interest in botanical and ecological studies."
