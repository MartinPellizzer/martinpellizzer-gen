    "intro": "Cimicifuga dahurica, commonly known as Dahurian bugbane, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Asia. It features tall, unbranched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, compound leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, spathaceous flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots contain compounds used in traditional medicine, particularly for their potential anti-inflammatory properties. Cimicifuga dahurica thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats."
