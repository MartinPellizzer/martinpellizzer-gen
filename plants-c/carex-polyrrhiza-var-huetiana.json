    "intro": "Carex polyrrhiza var. huetiana, commonly known as the Huet's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, cylindrical inflorescences. This variety is native to wetlands and moist soils in temperate regions, often found in marshy or swampy environments. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
