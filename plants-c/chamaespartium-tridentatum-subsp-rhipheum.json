    "intro": "Chamaespartium tridentatum subsp. rhipheum, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and tall, branched stems that bear small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, dry fruits called achene, which are typically surrounded by a pappus for wind dispersal. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and meadows. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the dry, sunny conditions of its native habitat."
