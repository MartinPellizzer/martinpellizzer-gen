    "intro": "Cirsium kasaianum, commonly known as the Kasaian thistle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and large, velvety leaves. The plant produces purple to pink flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is typically clump-forming, with a dense root system that helps it thrive in rocky or arid soils. Cirsium kasaianum is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
