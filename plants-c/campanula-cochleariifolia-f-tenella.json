    "intro": "Campanula cochleariifolia f. tenella, commonly known as the dwarf bellflower, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often with a white throat. The foliage is characterized by narrow, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained soil. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
