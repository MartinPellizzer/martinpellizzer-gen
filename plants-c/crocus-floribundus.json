    "intro": "Crocus floribundus, commonly known as the garden crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in early spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and has a compact growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its bulbs are adapted to well-drained soil and full sun, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees, and the plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and ease of cultivation."
