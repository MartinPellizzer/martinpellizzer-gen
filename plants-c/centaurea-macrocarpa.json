It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking purple to red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces cylindrical, bristly seed heads that are distinctive and often persist into autumn. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue. Centaurea macrocarpa is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils."
