    "intro": "Corymbia intermedia, commonly known as the red blood gum, is a species of flowering tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale to reddish bark that peels in thin layers, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, white or pink flowers clustered in spikes, which bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating. Corymbia intermedia is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species."
