It is characterized by its yellowish-green foliage and produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes. Its leaves are aromatic and contain compounds that contribute to its bitter taste. Uinta bitterbrush plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly as a food source for birds and insects."
