It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts, and is characterized by its glossy, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, chestnut-like fruits that are encased in a spiny husk. Castanopsis cerebrina is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. However, it can become invasive in certain regions outside its native range."
