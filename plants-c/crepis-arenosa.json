    "intro": "Crepis arenosa, commonly known as the sandy hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and bright yellow composite flowers that resemble a dandelion. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Crepis arenosa is often found growing in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
