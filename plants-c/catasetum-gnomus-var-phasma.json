    "intro": "Catasetum gnomus var. phasma, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent petals and sepals, which give it its ethereal appearance. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It produces a unique, elongated flower spike that bears a single, showy bloom. Due to its habitat specificity and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many regions."
