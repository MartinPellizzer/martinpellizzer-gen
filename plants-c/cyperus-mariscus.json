    "intro": "Cyperus mariscus, commonly known as marsh flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common species in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Cyperus mariscus produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered at the base of the plant. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
