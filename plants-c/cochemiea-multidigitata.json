    "intro": "Cochemiea multidigitata, commonly known as the clustered cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny clusters of stems that form a compact, shrub-like structure. The plant has small, pale green leaves that are usually reduced to spines, and it produces yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Cochemiea multidigitata is a slow-growing plant that is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance."
