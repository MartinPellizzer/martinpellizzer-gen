    "intro": "Carludovica polymera, commonly known as the Mexican giant cactus, is a species of cactus native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height, covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces large, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems for survival in arid environments. Carludovica polymera is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun."
