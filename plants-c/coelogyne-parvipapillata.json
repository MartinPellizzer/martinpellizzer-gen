    "intro": "Coelogyne parvipapillata, commonly known as the small-papilla coelogyne, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Coelogyne parvipapillata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
