    "intro": "Castilleja pallida subsp. septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern pale castilleja, is a hemiparasitic plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family. It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and is typically found in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on host plants for a portion of its nutritional needs. It is native to the western United States, particularly in areas of Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
