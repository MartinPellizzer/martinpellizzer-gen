    "intro": "Cycnium dentiflorum, commonly known as the toothflower bladdernut, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it often grows in moist, wooded areas. Cycnium dentiflorum is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
