    "intro": "Chione myrtifolia, commonly known as the white mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and marshes. The plant features showy white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a slightly serrated margin. The plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils."
