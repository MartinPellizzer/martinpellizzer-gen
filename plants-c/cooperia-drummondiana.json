    "intro": "Cooperia drummondiana, commonly known as the Drummond's cooperia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Southwestern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as a low, spreading shrub with small, narrow leaves. Its flowers are yellow and clustered in dense, rounded heads, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Cooperia drummondiana is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
