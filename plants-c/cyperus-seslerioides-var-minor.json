    "intro": "Cyperus seslerioides var. minor, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered spikelets that produce wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands. The species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
