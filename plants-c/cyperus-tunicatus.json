    "intro": "Cyperus tunicatus, commonly known as the nut sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant features triangular stems and produces small, three-lobed leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. Cyperus tunicatus is often found in wetland areas, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a common weed and an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
