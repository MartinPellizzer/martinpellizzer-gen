    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia var. aitanica, commonly known as the Aitanic bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its rounded, broad leaves and clusters of bell-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowers. The variety aitanica is distinguished by its larger, more showy blooms compared to the typical form of Campanula rotundifolia."
