    "intro": "Cleistocactus clavicaulis, commonly known as the \"clavicle cactus,\" is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, a unique trait among cacti. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its striking appearance and slow growth, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in succulent gardens."
