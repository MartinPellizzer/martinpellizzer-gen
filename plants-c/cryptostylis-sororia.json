    "intro": "Cryptostylis sororia, commonly known as the purple-veined orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its striking violet and green veined leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers with a distinctive purple and white coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowering period occurs during the cooler months, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. The species is relatively rare and is often found in association with other orchid species in its native habitat."
