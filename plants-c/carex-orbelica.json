    "intro": "Carex orbelica, commonly known as the Orbelica sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are followed by three-sided, three-rowed spikelets. Carex orbelica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
