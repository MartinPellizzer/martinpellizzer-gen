    "intro": "Cymbidium tesselloides, commonly known as the tessellated orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant produces linear, grass-like leaves and has a pseudobulb structure typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow with intricate patterns resembling tessellations, hence its common name. Cymbidium tesselloides is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower."
