    "intro": "Cyperus pseudovestitus f. angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved flatsedge, is a variant of the Cyperus genus, characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves. It is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions, typically found in wetland or marshy habitats. The plant has a compact, low-growing structure with dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in wet environments and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
