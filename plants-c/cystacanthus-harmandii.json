    "intro": "Cystacanthus harmandii, commonly known as the Harmand's bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap air and aid in floating. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in shallow, nutrient-rich ponds and lakes. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous. Cystacanthus harmandii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and contributing to water oxygenation."
