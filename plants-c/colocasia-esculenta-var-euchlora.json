    "intro": "Colocasia esculenta var. euchlora, commonly known as the black calla lily, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 inches in diameter, often with a deep green to nearly black coloration. The plant produces showy, white or pale yellow spatulate flowers that are typically surrounded by a dark purple or black spathe. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for water gardens and shaded landscapes. This variety is also valued for its potential as a vegetable, though its tubers are less commonly consumed compared to other Colocasia species."
