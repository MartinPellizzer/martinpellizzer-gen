    "intro": "Corethrogyne incana, commonly known as the silverleaf corethrogyne, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and landscaping in dry climates."
