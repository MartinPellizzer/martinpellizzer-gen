    "intro": "Caucanthus albidus f. tristylus, commonly known as the white caucanthus with tristylic form, is a rare and distinctive variation of the caucanthus genus. It is characterized by its pale, almost white flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a subtle fragrance. The plant is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills. Its tristylic form refers to the presence of three different types of stamens, which is a notable botanical feature. This variation is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral morphology and limited distribution."
