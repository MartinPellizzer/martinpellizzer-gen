It features striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are basal and often covered in a fine, white down. Its corm-like underground stem stores nutrients, allowing it to survive harsh winters. It is adapted to grow in well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats."
