    "intro": "Chloraea secunda, commonly known as the silverleaf daisy, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features a basal rosette of silvery, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with a central disc, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is widely cultivated in arid regions."
