    "intro": "Convolvulus coriaceus, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with hairy, succulent stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and sandy habitats. Convolvulus coriaceus is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important pioneer species in disturbed environments."
