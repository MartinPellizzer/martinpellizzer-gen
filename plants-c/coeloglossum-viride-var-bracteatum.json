    "intro": "Coeloglossum viride var. bracteatum, commonly known as the bracteate green hoya, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asclepiadaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are often hidden beneath the leaves. It is a popular houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its attractive, trailing growth habit. The varietal form bracteatum is distinguished by the presence of bracts, which are modified leaves that often resemble the flowers."
