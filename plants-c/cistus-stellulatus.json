    "intro": "Cistus stellulatus, commonly known as the starflower or creeping rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with woody stems and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant. Cistus stellulatus is also known for its aromatic foliage and is often used in traditional medicine."
