It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, featuring a woody stem and dense foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often covered in fine hairs, while its bark is smooth and pale in color. Chrysoma arborescens is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
