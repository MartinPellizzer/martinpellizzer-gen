    "intro": "Cyperus callophorus, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with dense, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically clustered at the top of the stems. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Cyperus callophorus is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive, umbrella-like appearance."
