    "intro": "Calyptrostylis gigantea, commonly known as the giant calyptrostylis, is a striking orchid native to the wet tropical regions of Australia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in length, with a distinctive hood-like structure formed by the fused sepals and petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, often found on tree trunks or rocks in humid environments. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid or semi-arid habitats. The orchid's unique morphology and vibrant floral display make it a prized specimen among orchid enthusiasts."
