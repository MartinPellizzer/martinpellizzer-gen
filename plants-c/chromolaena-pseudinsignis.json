    "intro": "Chromolaena pseudinsignis, commonly known as the false chromolaena, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands due to its adaptability and rapid growth. Chromolaena pseudinsignis is also known for its potential medicinal uses in traditional remedies."
