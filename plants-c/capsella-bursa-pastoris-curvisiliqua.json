    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris curvisiliqua, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by heart-shaped seed pods that burst to disperse seeds. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and a basal rosette growth habit. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Its rapid life cycle and ability to spread through wind-dispersed seeds make it a common weed in many regions."
