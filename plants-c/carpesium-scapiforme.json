    "intro": "Carpesium scapiforme, commonly known as the scarlet beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant produces bright orange to red flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its stems are hairy and often have sticky glands, which can make handling the plant uncomfortable. Carpesium scapiforme is typically found in moist, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges."
