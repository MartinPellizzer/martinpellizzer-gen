    "intro": "Carex inflata var. utriculata, commonly known as the bladder sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikes of pale to greenish flowers. The plant has distinctive, inflated, bladder-like structures called utricles that enclose its seeds, a feature that gives it its common name. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
