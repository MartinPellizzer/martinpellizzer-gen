It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers. The species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife."
