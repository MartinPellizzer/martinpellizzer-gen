    "intro": "Cerastium texanum, commonly known as Texas mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It features small, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It is part of the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes other flowering plants with similar growth habits. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in arid landscapes."
