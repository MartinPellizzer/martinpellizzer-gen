    "intro": "Cyclophorus scolopendrium, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is native to various regions of the world. This fern is characterized by its unique, zigzagging fronds that give it its common name. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal."
