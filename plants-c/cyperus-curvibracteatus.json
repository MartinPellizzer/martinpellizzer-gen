    "intro": "Cyperus curvibracteatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically arranged in a tight, compact cluster. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are grouped in spikelets, often found at the base of the plant. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Cyperus curvibracteatus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
