    "intro": "Chrysosplenium hydrocotylifolium, commonly known as water shield, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features small, floating leaves that are heart-shaped and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in early summer. Its root system helps stabilize aquatic sediments, contributing to the health of wetland ecosystems. Chrysosplenium hydrocotylifolium is an important food source for various aquatic insects and waterfowl."
