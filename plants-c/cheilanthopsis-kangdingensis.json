    "intro": "Cheilanthopsis kangdingensis, commonly known as the Kangding fern, is a rare species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, evergreen fronds that are typically leathery and have a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China, where it thrives in cool, humid environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
