    "intro": "Clinopodium nepeta subsp. glandulosum, commonly known as woolly mint, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in whorled clusters along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Its essential oils, rich in menthol and other compounds, make it valuable in both traditional medicine and aromatherapy."
