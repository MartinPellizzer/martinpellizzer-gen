    "intro": "Cyphomandra caracasana, commonly known as the Caracas nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. The plant produces small, egg-shaped fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. While the fruits are edible when ripe, the plant contains toxic alkaloids, so caution is advised when handling it."
