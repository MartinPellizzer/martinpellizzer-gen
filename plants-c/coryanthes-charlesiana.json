    "intro": "Coryanthes charlesiana, commonly known as the Charlesian orchid, is a tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, hooded floral structure with a deep, often colorful pouch that serves as a trap for insect pollinators. The plant has a unique morphology, featuring a slender stem and a single, showy flower that can grow up to 20 centimeters in length. Its specialized pollination mechanism involves deceptive attraction of insects, which are lured by the scent and shape of the flower. This orchid is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouse environments due to its specific care requirements."
