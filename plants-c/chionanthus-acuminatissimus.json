It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The fruit is a small, capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
