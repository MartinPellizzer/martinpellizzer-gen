    "intro": "Cenchrus weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in its range."
