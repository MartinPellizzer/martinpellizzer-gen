    "intro": "Cyanicula fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant cyan flower, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features delicate, bell-shaped blossoms that range in color from pale blue to deep violet, often with a subtle iridescence. The plant's leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white pubescence, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, blooming from late spring to early summer. The scent of the flowers is described as a mix of citrus and lavender, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
