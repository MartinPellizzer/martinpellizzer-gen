    "intro": "Carex lativena, commonly known as the native sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of eastern North America. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Carex lativena plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
