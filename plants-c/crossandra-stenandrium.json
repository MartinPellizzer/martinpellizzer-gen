    "intro": "Crossandra stenandrium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flame flower, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant orange-red tubular flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stem. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Crossandra stenandrium is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
