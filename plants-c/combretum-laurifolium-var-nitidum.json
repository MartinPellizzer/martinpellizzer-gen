    "intro": "Combretum laurifolium var. nitidum, commonly known as the glossy-leaved flame bush, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that become glossy in texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. The bark is smooth and reddish-brown, and the plant is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms."
