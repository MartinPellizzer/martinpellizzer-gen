    "intro": "Chloris diluta, commonly known as slender grass or slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Chloris diluta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
