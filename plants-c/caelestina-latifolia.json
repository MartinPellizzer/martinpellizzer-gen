    "intro": "Caelestina latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf skyflower, is a striking herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that range in color from deep green to bluish-gray, giving it a unique visual appeal. The plant produces clusters of delicate, sky-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Caelestina latifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth."
