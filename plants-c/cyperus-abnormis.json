    "intro": "Cyperus abnormis, commonly known as the swamp cyperus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. It has slender, grass-like stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often green or reddish in color. Cyperus abnormis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
