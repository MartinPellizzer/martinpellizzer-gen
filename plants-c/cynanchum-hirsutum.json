It features upright stems that are often hairy, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils and can thrive in woodland or open areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a notable species in ecological studies and traditional herbal medicine."
