    "intro": "Cardamine macrophylla, commonly known as broadleaf watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It features alternate, lanceolate leaves that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively in wetland habitats. The leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor, making it a valued species in some culinary traditions."
