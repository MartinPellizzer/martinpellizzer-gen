    "intro": "Ctenopteris humbertii, commonly known as Humbert's sea palm, is a rare and unique species of fern that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its robust, tree-like structure with a thick, trunk-like stem covered in a fibrous sheath. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that are typically green and can grow up to several meters in length. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
