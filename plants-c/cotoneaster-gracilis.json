    "intro": "Cotoneaster gracilis, commonly known as the slender cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. Cotoneaster gracilis is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile addition to landscaping."
