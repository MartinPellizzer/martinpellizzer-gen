    "intro": "Cyphia tomentosa var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth cyphia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and stems, which distinguish it from other varieties of Cyphia. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
