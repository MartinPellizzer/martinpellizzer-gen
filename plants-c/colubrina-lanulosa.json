    "intro": "Colubrina lanulosa, commonly known as the woolly colubrina, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, oval leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a woolly appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, spherical fruits. Its adaptability to various soil types and drought tolerance make it a hardy plant in coastal and sandy environments. The woolly colubrina is also valued for its ornamental appeal and role in supporting local wildlife."
