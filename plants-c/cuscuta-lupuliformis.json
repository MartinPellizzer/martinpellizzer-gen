    "intro": "Cuscuta lupuliformis, commonly known as the hop vine, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found growing on shrubs and trees in moist, temperate regions. The plant's stems are wiry and can\u7f20\u7ed5 around its host, forming a dense network. It is native to North America and is considered an invasive species in some areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread efficiently across different habitats."
