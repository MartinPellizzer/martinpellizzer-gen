    "intro": "Crataegus laevigata var. microphylla, commonly known as the common hawthorn or small-leaved hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in length. The plant produces white or pinkish flowers in spring, followed by red or orange berries in the autumn. It thrives in a variety of soils but prefers well-drained conditions and full to partial sun. This species is often used in hedgerows and as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ecological value."
