    "intro": "Casearia calodendron, commonly known as the golden flame tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glossy green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slight pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by orange or red berries that are edible for some bird species. Casearia calodendron thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and seasonal floral display."
