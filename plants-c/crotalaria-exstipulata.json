It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pinnately compound leaves with narrow, elongated leaflets. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that are often surrounded by small, leaf-like bracts. Its seed pods are elongated and contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Crotalaria exstipulata is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock."
