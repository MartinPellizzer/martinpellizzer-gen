    "intro": "Cleome monophylla var. cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf cleome, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves with a heart-shaped base, which give it its botanical name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom throughout the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance ornamental plant. Its rapid growth and ability to self-seed make it a resilient addition to native plant gardens."
