    "intro": "Cymopterus parryi, commonly known as Parry's evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers that open in the evening. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and branching. Cymopterus parryi plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly moths and beetles, due to its night-blooming nature."
