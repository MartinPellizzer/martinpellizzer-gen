    "intro": "Cotoneaster microphyllus, commonly known as the dwarf cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, giving it its species name \"microphyllus.\" The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a hedging plant. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in temperate climates."
