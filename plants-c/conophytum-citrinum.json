    "intro": "Conophytum citrinum, commonly known as the yellow conophytum, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, leaf-like structures that store water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or summer. Its compact size and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation. Conophytum citrinum thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water to prevent root rot."
