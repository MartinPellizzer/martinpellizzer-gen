    "intro": "Corethrogyne filaginifolia var. typica, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with a mat-forming habit, featuring dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, silver-green leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to survive in poor soils and withstand periods of drought. The species is adapted to full sun and is often found in rocky or sandy soils in desert ecosystems."
