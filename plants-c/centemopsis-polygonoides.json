    "intro": "Centemopsis polygonoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf centemopsis, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as a low-growing shrub with narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its small, yellowish flowers appear in clusters and bloom during the cooler months. Centemopsis polygonoides is adapted to survive in poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
