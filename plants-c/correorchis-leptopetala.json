    "intro": "Correorchis leptopetala, commonly known as the slender-petaled twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, leafless stem that supports its single, showy flower. The plant has a distinctive white to pale yellow blossom with a lip that is often marked with purple or brown spots. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
