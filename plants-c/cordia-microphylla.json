    "intro": "Cordia microphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cordia, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round, fleshy fruits that are often eaten by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is adapted to saline environments. Cordia microphylla is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
