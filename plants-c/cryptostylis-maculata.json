    "intro": "Cryptostylis maculata, commonly known as the spotted spider-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers with distinctive red or purple markings. The plant typically grows in open forests and grasslands, often in sandy or loamy soils. It produces its flowers in late summer to autumn and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
