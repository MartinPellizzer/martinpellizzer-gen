It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces achenes (small, dry fruits) that are dispersed by wind. It is often found in dry, disturbed soils and can be invasive in some areas. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and thistles."
