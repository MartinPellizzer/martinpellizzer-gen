    "intro": "Cymbidium reptans, commonly known as the creeping orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It produces tall, slender stems with clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Cymbidium reptans is valued for its ornamental flowers and its ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates."
