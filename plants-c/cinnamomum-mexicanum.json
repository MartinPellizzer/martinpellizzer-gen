    "intro": "Cinnamomum mexicanum, commonly known as Mexican cinnamon, is a small evergreen tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like laurel and camphor. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale green. Its bark and leaves are used to make a spice similar to cinnamon, though it is less commonly traded than Cinnamomum verum. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils."
