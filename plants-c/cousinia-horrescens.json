    "intro": "Cousinia horrescens, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in the spring or early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration. Cousinia horrescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes."
