It is characterized by its distinctive, beak-like buds and hairy stems, which are covered in glandular structures. The plant produces small, yellowish male catkins and female flowers that develop into edible nuts. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated margins, turning yellow in the fall. This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or streamside habitats."
