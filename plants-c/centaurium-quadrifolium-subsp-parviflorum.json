    "intro": "Centaurium quadrifolium subsp. parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered centaury, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that produce small, bright yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its flowers are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
