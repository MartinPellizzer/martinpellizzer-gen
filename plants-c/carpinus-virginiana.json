    "intro": "Carpinus virginiana, commonly known as American hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark that becomes furrowed with age, and its small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that mature in the fall. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained sites. The plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to tolerate urban environments."
