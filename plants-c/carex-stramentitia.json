    "intro": "Carex stramentitia, commonly known as the slender sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it often grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant typically reaches heights of 30 to 60 centimeters and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat for various invertebrates."
