    "intro": "Celtis biondii f. holophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf hackberry, is a rare and distinctive variant of the hackberry genus. It is characterized by its pale, almost silvery foliage, which sets it apart from other Celtis species. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is found in specific regions of the southwestern United States. Its leaves are often smaller and more densely packed compared to the typical form. The fruit is small, smooth, and edible, though not as widely consumed as other hackberry species."
