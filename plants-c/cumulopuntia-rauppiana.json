    "intro": "Cumulopuntia rauppiana, commonly known as the Raupp's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to southern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in dense, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by edible, fleshy fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to poor soil conditions. Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for xerophytic landscapes."
