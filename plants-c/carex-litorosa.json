    "intro": "Carex litorosa, commonly known as salt marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal wetlands. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in late spring. This plant thrives in brackish or saline environments, making it an important component of tidal marsh ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in muddy or sandy habitats. Carex litorosa plays a vital role in filtering water and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
