    "intro": "Combretum latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, ovate leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and striking foliage make it a notable species in its native habitats."
