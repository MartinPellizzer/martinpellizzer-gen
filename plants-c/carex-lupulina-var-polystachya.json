    "intro": "Carex lupulina var. polystachya, commonly known as the clustered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, cylindrical leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are typically green to reddish in color, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along streambanks. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
