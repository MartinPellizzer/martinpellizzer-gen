    "intro": "Cerastium apetalum, commonly known as the snow-in-summer, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, often covering the entire plant. Its leaves are typically rounded and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it thrives in moist, shady environments. Cerastium apetalum is often used in garden settings for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
