    "intro": "Coleochloa setifera subsp. setifera, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves that are often covered in short, stiff hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open habitats such as grasslands and forest margins. Its inflorescence consists of a narrow, spike-like cluster of small, two-ranked spikelets. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, grass-like appearance."
