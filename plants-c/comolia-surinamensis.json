It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed-like species. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. Its flowers are showy, with five petals and a prominent corona, often in shades of yellow or orange. The plant produces berries that contain seeds covered in a silky, white aril, aiding in its dispersal by animals."
