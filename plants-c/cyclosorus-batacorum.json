    "intro": "Cyclosorus batacorum, commonly known as the Batacorum water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically four-lobed and resemble a four-leaf clover. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures include tiny, spore-producing clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the leaves. Cyclosorus batacorum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
