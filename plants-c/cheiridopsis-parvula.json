    "intro": "Cheiridopsis parvula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ice plant, is a small, succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, cylindrical leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically during the winter months. It is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it requires minimal care once established."
