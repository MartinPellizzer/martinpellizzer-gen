It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
