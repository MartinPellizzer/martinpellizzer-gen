    "intro": "Crotularius, commonly known as the bladder nut, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, inflated seed pods that resemble bladders, which help in seed dispersal. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The leaves are typically compound, with pairs of leaflets, and the flowers are small and often clustered. Crotularius species are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value or used in traditional medicine."
