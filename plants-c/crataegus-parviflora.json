    "intro": "Crataegus parviflora, commonly known as the parviflora hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and mammals but are generally not consumed by humans. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate with serrated edges, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. Crataegus parviflora is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and providing habitat for wildlife."
