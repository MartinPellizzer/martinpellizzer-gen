    "intro": "Cardamomum palustre, commonly known as marsh cardamom, is a perennial herb native to wetland and marshy habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It features erect, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which are followed by capsule fruits containing aromatic seeds. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in waterlogged soils. Cardamomum palustre is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
