    "intro": "Corallorhiza trifida f. verna, commonly known as the early green coralroot, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to eastern North America. It is a myco-heterotroph, meaning it derives its nutrients from fungi rather than through photosynthesis. The plant lacks chlorophyll and appears as a small, greenish-yellow or brownish stem with whorled leaves. It typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with specific fungal hosts. Due to its rarity and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
