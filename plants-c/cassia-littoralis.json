    "intro": "Cassia littoralis, commonly known as coastal cassia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows near the shoreline, thriving in sandy or saline soils. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing seeds. Its leaves are compound, with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs. Cassia littoralis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
