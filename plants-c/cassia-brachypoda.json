    "intro": "Cassia brachypoda, commonly known as narrowleaf cassia, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and yellow, fluffy flower clusters that bloom in the spring. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Cassia brachypoda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
