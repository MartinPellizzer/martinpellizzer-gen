    "intro": "Campanula polyantha, commonly known as the many-flowered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features hairy stems and leaves that are usually lance-shaped with serrated edges. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Campanula polyantha is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
