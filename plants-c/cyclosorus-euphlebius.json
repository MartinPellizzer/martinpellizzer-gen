    "intro": "Cyclosorus euphlebius, commonly known as the water scurf, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It is characterized by its ribbon-like, ribbon-shaped leaves that are often found floating on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater bodies. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged, and it is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Cyclosorus euphlebius is a perennial species that can form dense mats, contributing to water filtration and providing habitat for microorganisms. It is widely distributed across temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
