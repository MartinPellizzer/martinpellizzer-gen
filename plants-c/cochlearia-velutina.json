    "intro": "Cochlearia velutina, commonly known as the velvet mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant native to the British Isles. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its leaves are covered in a dense, velvety layer of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. Cochlearia velutina is often found in calcareous soils and is a common sight in early spring."
