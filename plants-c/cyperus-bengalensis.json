    "intro": "Cyperus bengalensis, commonly known as the Bengal flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. Cyperus bengalensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
