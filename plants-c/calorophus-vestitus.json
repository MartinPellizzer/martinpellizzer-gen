    "intro": "Calorophus vestitus, commonly known as the naked sunflower, is a unique member of the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, sparsely haired leaves and yellow, daisy-like flowers. Native to the arid regions of South America, it has adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments. The plant's name reflects its bare appearance, with minimal foliage and a striking central flower head. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
