It features delicate, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant collections."
