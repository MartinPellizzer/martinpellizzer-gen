    "intro": "Cardamine hirsuta var. bracteata, commonly known as the hairy watercress, is a perennial herb native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. It features trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture, and its stems are often reddish and branched. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by heart-shaped, greenish seed pods. It thrives in wet soils along streams, marshes, and woodland edges. This variety is distinguished by its bracteate leaves, which are covered in fine hairs and contribute to its unique appearance."
