    "intro": "Calluna ciliaris, commonly known as the silver heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the British Isles. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white layer of fine hairs, giving it its common name. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and moorland habitats. Calluna ciliaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
