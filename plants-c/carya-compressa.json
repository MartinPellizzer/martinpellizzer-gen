    "intro": "Carya compressa, commonly known as the smooth walnut, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Juglandaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges. The tree produces small, yellowish-green male flowers and female flowers that develop into oval, green drupes. Its seeds, encased in a hard shell, are edible after the husk is removed. The plant is valued for its wood, which is strong and durable, and for its ecological role in supporting wildlife."
