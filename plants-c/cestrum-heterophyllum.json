    "intro": "Cestrum heterophyllum, commonly known as the yellow bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. These flowers are followed by bright orange or red berries that contain the seeds. Cestrum heterophyllum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
