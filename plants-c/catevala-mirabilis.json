    "intro": "Catevala mirabilis, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink, red, and white, often with a distinctive golden eye at the center. The plant thrives in shallow freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. Its leaves are broad and floating, while its roots anchor it to the substrate. The sacred lotus is not only admired for its beauty but also holds cultural and religious significance in many Asian traditions."
