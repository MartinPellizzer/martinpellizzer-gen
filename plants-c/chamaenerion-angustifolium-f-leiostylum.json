It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of pink to red flowers that bloom in summer. This subspecies is typically found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and clearings, across northern regions. Its growth habit is herbaceous, with a tendency to form dense stands. The plant is adapted to cold climates and can persist in areas with limited nutrient availability."
