    "intro": "Centella ternata, commonly known as Asiatic pennywort, is a creeping herbaceous plant native to Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are usually less than 1 inch in diameter, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, three-lobed fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along streams. Centella ternata is valued in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
