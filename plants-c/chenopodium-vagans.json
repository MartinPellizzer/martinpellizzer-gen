    "intro": "Chenopodium vagans, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are usually alternate and have a rough texture, while its seeds are tiny and dispersed by wind. Chenopodium vagans is often considered a weed but can play a role in stabilizing soil in certain environments."
