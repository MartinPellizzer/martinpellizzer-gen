    "intro": "Cladodes thozetiana, commonly known as the desert candle cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, cylindrical cladodes that resemble candles, which are modified stems used for photosynthesis. The plant produces yellow flowers during the rainy season, adding a striking visual contrast to its green, spiny structure. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it highly adapted to drought conditions. The cladodes are often covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight."
