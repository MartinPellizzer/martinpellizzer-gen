It typically measures between 15 to 30 centimeters in length and has a mild, slightly sweet flavor. The plant is an annual herbaceous vine that thrives in warm climates, producing yellow flowers that develop into the edible fruit. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. This variety is cultivated for its crisp, refreshing fruit, which is commonly used in salads and as a garnish."
