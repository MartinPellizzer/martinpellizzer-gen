    "intro": "Cousinia tscherneviae, commonly known as the Karakoram snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Cousinia tscherneviae plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme climates."
