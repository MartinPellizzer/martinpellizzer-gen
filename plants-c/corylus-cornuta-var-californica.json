    "intro": "Corylus cornuta var. californica, commonly known as the California hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It features finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces catkin-like male flowers and female flowers in separate clusters, typical of the hazelnut genus. Its edible nuts are encased in a hairy husk that splits open when mature. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and seasonal interest."
