    "intro": "Catopsis pedicellata, commonly known as the rock moss or catopsis, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has a dark green to reddish-brown color, with leafy structures that are typically narrow and elongated. It reproduces via spores and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions. Catopsis pedicellata plays a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats."
