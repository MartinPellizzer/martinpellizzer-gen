It is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in well-draining soil and moderate light conditions. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by fluffy, white berries that contain seeds. Its most distinctive feature is its long, arching leaves that often have a white or silver stripe running down their center. It is widely popular as a houseplant due to its ability to purify indoor air and its easy care requirements."
