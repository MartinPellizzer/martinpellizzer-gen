    "intro": "Caladenia douglasiorum, commonly known as the Douglas's spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Western Australia. It typically grows in heathland and open forests, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features a single, erect stem with a single, strikingly colored flower that resembles a spider, hence its common name. Its flowers are usually pink or purple with intricate patterns, and it blooms during the autumn season. Caladenia douglasiorum is a protected species due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss."
