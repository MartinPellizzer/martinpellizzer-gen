    "intro": "Capsicum dumetorum, commonly known as \"chicory pepper\" or \"wild chili,\" is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family. It is native to South America and is characterized by its small, elongated fruits that range in color from green to red. The plant typically grows in shrubland and grassland habitats, often in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with five petals. The fruit is edible when ripe and has a spicy, pungent flavor due to the presence of capsaicinoids."
