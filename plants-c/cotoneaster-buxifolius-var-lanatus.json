    "intro": "Cotoneaster buxifolius var. lanatus, commonly known as the woolly cotoneaster, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, woolly layer of white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a decorative plant in gardens."
