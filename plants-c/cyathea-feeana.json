    "intro": "Cyathea feeana, commonly known as the Fee's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizome system supports the growth of the trunk and roots, allowing it to form a sturdy, upright structure. Cyathea feeana is often found in coastal and lowland forests, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
