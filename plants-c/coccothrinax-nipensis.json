    "intro": "Coccothrinax nipensis, commonly known as the Key West palm, is a small, cold-tolerant palm native to the Florida Keys and parts of the Caribbean. It has a slender, unbranched trunk that often develops a grayish sheen with age. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by edible, sweet fruits that are consumed by birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are feather-like and arranged in a dense, fan-shaped crown. This species is well adapted to coastal environments and is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and resilience."
