    "intro": "Cyclosorus truncatus, commonly known as the truncated cyclosorus, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, terrestrial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a thalloid structure with a leafy, flattened body that is often covered in a layer of tiny, scale-like structures. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered in cup-like formations called sorus, which are positioned on the underside of the leaves. Cyclosorus truncatus is characterized by its distinctive, truncate (cut-off) leaf shape, which gives it its common name."
