    "intro": "Coronilla glauca subsp. pentaphylloides, commonly known as the blue crown vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and purple to pink pea-like flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a deep root system, which helps it thrive in dry and rocky soils. It is often used for erosion control due to its vigorous growth and nitrogen-fixing ability. Its subspecies status highlights subtle differences in morphology compared to the typical form of Coronilla glauca."
