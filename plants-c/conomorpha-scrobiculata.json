    "intro": "Conomorpha scrobiculata, commonly known as the white sand lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its leaf-like thallus with a pale green to white upper surface and a darker, often reddish underside. The plant thrives in dry, sunny environments, typically on bare soil or rock surfaces in arid regions. It is known for its ability to tolerate extreme environmental conditions, making it a common indicator species in semi-arid ecosystems. The lichen's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium."
