    "intro": "Cynanchum jaramilloi, commonly known as Jaramillo's milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Cynanchum jaramilloi is also known for its latex-like sap, which can be toxic to some animals."
