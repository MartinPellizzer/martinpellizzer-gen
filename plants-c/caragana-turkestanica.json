    "intro": "Caragana turkestanica, commonly known as the Turkestan shrub or false peashrub, is a deciduous shrub native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched structure and compound leaves composed of 8-14 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, followed by pods containing small, kidney-shaped seeds. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or loamy soils, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid regions. Caragana turkestanica is often used for erosion control and as a windbreak due to its hardy nature and rapid growth."
