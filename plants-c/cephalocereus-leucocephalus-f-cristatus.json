    "intro": "Cephalocereus leucocephalus f. cristatus, commonly known as the cristate white-armed cactus, is a unique variant of the white-armed cactus. It is characterized by its flattened, crown-like growth pattern, which results from a genetic mutation called \"cristata.\" The plant features a tall, branching structure with white, woolly spines and a dense covering of white, fuzzy hairs. It is native to the arid regions of Mexico and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. This rare and ornamental cactus is popular among collectors for its distinctive appearance and slow growth rate."
