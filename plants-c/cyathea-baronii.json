    "intro": "Cyathea baronii, commonly known as the Baron's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are arranged in clusters called sori. Cyathea baronii typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and along stream banks. Its slow growth rate and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation."
