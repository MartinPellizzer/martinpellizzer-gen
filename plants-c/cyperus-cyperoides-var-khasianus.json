    "intro": "Cyperus cyperoides var. khasianus, commonly known as the Khasi flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern regions of India. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that often form dense clusters, and its leaves are narrow and linear, usually ranging from 10 to 30 cm in length. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
