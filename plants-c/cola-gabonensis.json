    "intro": "Cola gabonensis, commonly known as African cola, is a species of flowering plant in the family Sterculiaceae. It is native to central and western Africa, where it grows in tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers that develop into hard, woody pods. Each pod contains several seeds surrounded by a thick, stimulant-rich pulp. This plant is economically significant for its seeds, which are used to produce caffeine-containing products."
