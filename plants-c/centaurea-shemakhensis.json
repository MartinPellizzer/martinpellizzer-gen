    "intro": "Centaurea shemakhensis, commonly known as the Shemakh redflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking red and purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with linear, gray-green leaves and a compact growth habit. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
