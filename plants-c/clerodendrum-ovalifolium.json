    "intro": "Clerodendrum ovalifolium, commonly known as the oval-leaved flame bush, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, featuring opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous tiny seeds, aiding in its propagation. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
