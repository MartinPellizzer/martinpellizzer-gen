    "intro": "Cyclobothra lutea, commonly known as the yellow cycad, is a species of cycad native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Cyclobothra lutea is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting slow growth and long lifespan. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable to extinction."
