    "intro": "Colchicum zangezurum, commonly known as the Zangezur colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the Colchicaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces a corm-like structure underground, which serves as its storage organ and enables it to survive in harsh environmental conditions. It typically blooms in late summer and early autumn, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
