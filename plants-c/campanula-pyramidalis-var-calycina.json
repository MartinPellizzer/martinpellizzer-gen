It features upright, branched stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, typically from late spring to early autumn."
