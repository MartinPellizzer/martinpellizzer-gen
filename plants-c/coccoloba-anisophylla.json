    "intro": "Coccoloba anisophylla, commonly known as the broadleaf coral tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its alternate, pinnately compound leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and whitish underneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by bright red or orange berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas or disturbed soils. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
