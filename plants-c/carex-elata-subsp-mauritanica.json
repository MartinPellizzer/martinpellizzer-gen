    "intro": "Carex elata subsp. mauritanica, commonly known as the tall sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like stems and dense clusters of cylindrical spikelets. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. It has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of dust or grit, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-maintenance garden settings."
