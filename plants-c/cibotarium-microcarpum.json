    "intro": "Cibotarium microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited cibotium, is a rare fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds with a finely divided structure. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
