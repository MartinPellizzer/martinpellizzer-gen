    "intro": "Cymbidium pendulum var. brevilabre, commonly known as the short-lipped orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that form a rosette at the base. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
