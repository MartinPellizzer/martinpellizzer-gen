    "intro": "Cardiochlamys discifera, commonly known as the disc-shaped heartshell, is a species of sea snail belonging to the family Turbinidae. It is characterized by its small, elongated shell that is typically pale in color with a smooth surface. The shell features a distinct disc-like shape at the base, which gives the species its common name. This marine gastropod is found in tropical and subtropical waters, often inhabiting sandy or muddy substrates. Its anatomy includes a well-developed radula and a muscular foot, typical of many gastropod species."
