    "intro": "Corchorus sublatus, commonly known as the silky dock, is a herbaceous annual plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features erect, branching stems covered in fine, silky hairs, which give it its common name. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a wavy or serrated margin. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. The plant is often found in moist soils along stream banks, roadsides, and disturbed areas."
