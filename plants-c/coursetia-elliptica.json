    "intro": "Coursetia elliptica, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, elliptical, evergreen leaves that are typically blue-green in color and covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
