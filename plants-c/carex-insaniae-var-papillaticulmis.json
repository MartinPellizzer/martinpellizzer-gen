    "intro": "Carex insaniae var. papillaticulmis, commonly known as the papillate sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of flowers, typically in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are often covered with fine, papillate (bump-like) structures, giving it a distinctive texture. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features and limited distribution."
