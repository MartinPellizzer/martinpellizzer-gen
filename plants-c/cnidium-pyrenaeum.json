    "intro": "Cnidium pyrenaeum, commonly known as the Pyrenean hogweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the carrot family. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. However, it is important to note that some species in this genus can be toxic, and caution should be exercised when handling or consuming it."
