    "intro": "Carex disticha var. gracilis, commonly known as slender basket sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy habitats. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability to fluctuating water levels."
