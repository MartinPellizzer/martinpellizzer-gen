It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Native to regions of southern Europe and parts of the Mediterranean, it thrives in well-drained soils and sunny conditions. Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
