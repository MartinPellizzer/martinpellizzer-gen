It is a lithophytic plant, typically growing on rock surfaces, and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The leaves are pinnately compound, with a dense covering of trichomes that give them a fuzzy appearance. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it a subject of interest in both botanical studies and horticultural cultivation."
