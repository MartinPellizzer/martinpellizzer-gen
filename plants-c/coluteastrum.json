It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plants typically have simple, alternate leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. Their flowers are small and inconspicuous, clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, a characteristic feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. Coluteastrum species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and adaptability to various growing conditions."
