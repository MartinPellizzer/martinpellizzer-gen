    "intro": "Calycopeplus oligandrus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are often arranged in a dense, compact form. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Calycopeplus oligandrus thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
