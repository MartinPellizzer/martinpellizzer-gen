It is characterized by its striking red or purple flowers that are often surrounded by white bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, spiny seeds that are dispersed by wind.
