    "intro": "Crepis aitchisonii, commonly known as the Aitchison's mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-forming, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The small yellow flowers bloom in late summer, contributing to its ornamental value in specialized gardens."
