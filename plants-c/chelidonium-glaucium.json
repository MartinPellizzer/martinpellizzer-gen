    "intro": "Chelidonium glaucium, commonly known as the yellow celandine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a stout, ridged stem that is often covered in a yellowish, waxy coating. The plant produces bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by oval, yellowish-green leaves with a distinctive waxy texture. Its root system is thick and fleshy, and it contains alkaloids that have been used in traditional medicine. Chelidonium glaucium is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed soils."
