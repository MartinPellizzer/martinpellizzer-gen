    "intro": "Cyclosorus \u00d7 varievenulosus, commonly known as the hybrid water clover, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Ceratophyllaceae. It is characterized by its small, rounded, floating leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that are typically submerged, making them difficult to observe. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with abundant sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
