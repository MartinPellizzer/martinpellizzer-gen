    "intro": "Ceratopteris parkeri, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing both spores and gametes in separate structures. Its fronds are divided into pinnae, which are arranged in a bipinnate pattern. This species is often used in aquatic habitats for erosion control and as a decorative plant in water gardens."
