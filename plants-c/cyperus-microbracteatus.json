    "intro": "Cyperus microbracteatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flatsedge, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, preferring moist to slightly saline soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowering structures, known as spikelets, are small and clustered, producing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Cyperus microbracteatus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
