    "intro": "Carex sychnostachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes over 5,000 species of sedges, rushes, and related plants. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, with a dense, compact growth habit that forms tussocks. The flowering heads, which are small and clustered, produce wind-pollinated flowers, contributing to its ecological role in supporting insect and bird life."
