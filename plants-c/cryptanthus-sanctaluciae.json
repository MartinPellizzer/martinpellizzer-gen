    "intro": "Cryptanthus sanctaluciae, commonly known as the San L\u00faculo cryptanthus, is a flowering plant native to South America, specifically found in Brazil. It belongs to the family Haemodoraceae, which includes species known for their striking, often red or orange-colored flowers. The plant is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Its flowers, which bloom in spring, are clustered in spikes and are adapted to attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
