    "intro": "Caucalis infesta var. minus, commonly known as the lesser caucalis, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological adaptability, it plays a minor role in local pollinator habitats."
