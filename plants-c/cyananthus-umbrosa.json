    "intro": "Cyananthus umbrosa, commonly known as the shadowy bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Polemoniacaceae and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Cyananthus umbrosa is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural range."
