    "intro": "Calathea blanda, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage with patterns resembling prayer hands, hence its common name. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and exhibit a unique ability to fold upwards at night, a trait known as nyctinasty. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Calathea blanda is a popular houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
