    "intro": "Corion rupicola, commonly known as the rock corion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green or yellowish in color. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in rocky soils and access deep water sources. Corion rupicola is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
