    "intro": "Cyclopogon epiphyticus, commonly known as the epiphytic bromeliad, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. This species is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring. It is native to the rainforests of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments."
