It is characterized by its unique, spiky, yellowish-green inflorescence that resembles a scorpion, hence its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its striking appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
