    "intro": "Capsella procumbens, commonly known as the creeping weed or common mouse-ear, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers with five petals and produces numerous tiny, dry fruits called achenes. The plant has hairy, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
