    "intro": "Cordia galeottiana, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to fleshy, orange-red berries. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich color, though it is also used in traditional medicine. Cordia galeottiana plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
