    "intro": "Codonoboea appressipilosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf codonopsis, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shady, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
