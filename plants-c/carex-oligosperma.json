    "intro": "Carex oligosperma, commonly known as slender sedges, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. The plant has a grass-like appearance with triangular stems and small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish or brownish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Carex oligosperma plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
