It features slender, upright stems that bear small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple. The plant has finely divided, thread-like leaves that give it its common name, and it thrives in cool, moist environments.

The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
