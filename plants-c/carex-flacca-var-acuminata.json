It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, inconspicuous flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
