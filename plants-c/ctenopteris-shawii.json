    "intro": "Ctenopteris shawii, commonly known as the Hawaiian water fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly Hawaii. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green and often have a waxy coating. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in humid forests. Its spores are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively. Ctenopteris shawii plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small aquatic organisms."
