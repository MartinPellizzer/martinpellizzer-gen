    "intro": "Commelina diffusa var. major, commonly known as the spreading dayflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Commelinaceae and is characterized by its erect stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, blue-violet flowers with three petals and three sepals, typically arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an aggressive weed in many ecosystems."
