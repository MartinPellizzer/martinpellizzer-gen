    "intro": "Crepidium commelinifolium, commonly known as the broad-leafed marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetlands and marshy areas in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish or white flowers in late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in swampy or seasonally flooded habitats. Its rhizomes help it survive in waterlogged conditions, and it plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of wetland ecosystems. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
