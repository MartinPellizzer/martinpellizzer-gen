    "intro": "Ceanothus neumannii, commonly known as Neumann's ceanothus, is a shrub native to the western United States. It typically grows in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats, preferring well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, sky-blue to white flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are evergreen, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-gray hue. Ceanothus neumannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
