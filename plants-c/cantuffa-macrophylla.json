    "intro": "Cantuffa macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its enormous, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still water. The plant's flowers are large and showy, typically appearing in shades of white and pink, and they bloom at night. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its leaves provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native wetlands by supporting biodiversity and contributing to water filtration."
