    "intro": "Circaea cardiophylla, commonly known as the heart-leaved whitebeard, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caprifoliaceae and is characterized by its small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are ovate to heart-shaped, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Circaea cardiophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and delicate blooms."
