    "intro": "Cerastium nutans var. compactum, commonly known as the dwarf white groundcover, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features small, upright stems covered with dense clusters of white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit. This variety is a hardy, easy-to-care-for plant that adds a delicate, floral touch to garden landscapes."
