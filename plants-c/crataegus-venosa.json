    "intro": "Crataegus venosa, commonly known as the veined hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to ovate leaves with a distinctive veined pattern, and clusters of white or pinkish flowers in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are edible for birds and small mammals. Crataegus venosa is often used in hedgerows and as an ornamental plant due to its hardiness and seasonal interest."
