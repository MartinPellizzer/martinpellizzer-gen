It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and shrublands. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Cirsium imereticum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
