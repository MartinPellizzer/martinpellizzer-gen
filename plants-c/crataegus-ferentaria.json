It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters, featuring thorny branches and oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces white or pink flowers in spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its fruits are an important food source for birds and small mammals, and the plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Crataegus ferentaria is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential cardiovascular benefits."
