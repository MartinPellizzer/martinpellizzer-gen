    "intro": "Cardamine umbellata, commonly known as the clustered water-cress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many edible and economically important plants. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a peppery aroma, similar to that of mustard greens. Its small, white flowers are arranged in an umbel, giving it its scientific name. The plant thrives in wet soils and is often found near streams, marshes, and woodland edges."
