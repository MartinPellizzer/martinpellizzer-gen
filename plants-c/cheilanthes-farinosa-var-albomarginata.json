    "intro": "Cheilanthes farinosa var. albomarginata, commonly known as the white-margin rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and rocky habitats in North America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rhizome and fronds that are typically gray-green with white margins. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species for xerophytic environments. Its fronds are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and resilience, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
