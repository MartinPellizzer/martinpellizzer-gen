    "intro": "Cactus icosagonus, commonly known as the twenty-sided cactus, is a unique species characterized by its distinct geometric shape. It features a tall, columnar stem with a polygonal cross-section, often displaying 20 sides, which is rare among cacti. The plant is native to arid regions of South America, where it thrives in dry, rocky soils. Its spines are short and clustered, providing protection while minimizing water loss. The flowers, which bloom in spring, are typically yellow or orange and attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
