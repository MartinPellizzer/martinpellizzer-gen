    "intro": "Cycas maconochiei subsp. maconochiei, commonly known as the Maconochie's cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines. It is a dioecious plant, meaning that male and female reproductive structures are found on separate plants. The plant features a short, stout trunk with a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. Its leaves are typically bright green and can grow up to several meters in length. This cycad is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also of interest to botanists due to its ancient lineage and ecological significance."
