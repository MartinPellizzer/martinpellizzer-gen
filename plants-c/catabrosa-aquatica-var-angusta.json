    "intro": "Catabrosa aquatica var. angusta, commonly known as narrowleaf water catabrosa, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow waters, forming dense mats that help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic life. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often floating or partially submerged, with small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving water, making it a common sight in ponds and wetlands. Its botanical features make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems, supporting biodiversity and water quality."
