    "intro": "Callitriche dubia, commonly known as the narrowleaf water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and ditches. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, opposite, oval-shaped leaves. Its flowers are tiny, white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, often floating at the water's surface. Callitriche dubia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
