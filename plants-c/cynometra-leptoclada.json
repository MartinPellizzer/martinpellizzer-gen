    "intro": "Cynometra leptoclada, commonly known as the slender-leaf ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
