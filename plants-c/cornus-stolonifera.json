    "intro": "Cornus stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping dogwood, is a perennial flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are typically oval or elliptic with a smooth margin and a slightly toothed base. Cornus stolonifera thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks."
