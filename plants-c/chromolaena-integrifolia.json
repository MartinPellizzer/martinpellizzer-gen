    "intro": "Chromolaena integrifolia, commonly known as horseweed, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves with smooth margins. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. It is often considered an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Chromolaena integrifolia is also used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
