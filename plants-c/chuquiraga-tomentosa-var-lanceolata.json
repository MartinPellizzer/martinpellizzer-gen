    "intro": "Chuquiraga tomentosa var. lanceolata, commonly known as the Andean velvetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its soft, woolly leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, contributing to its tactile texture. This species is well adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in rocky or semi-arid conditions."
