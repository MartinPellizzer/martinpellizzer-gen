    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna subvar. lucidula, commonly known as the glossy hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its smooth, glossy leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It typically grows in woodlands, hedgerows, and along stream banks. The bark is often flaky and can develop shallow furrows as the plant matures."
