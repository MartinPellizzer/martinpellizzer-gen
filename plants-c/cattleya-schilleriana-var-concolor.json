    "intro": "Cattleya schilleriana var. concolor, commonly known as the Schiller's Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting flowers that typically range from yellow to orange with dark red or purple markings. The plant features thick, fleshy roots and is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants rather than in soil. Its leaves are broad and sword-shaped, often arranged in a rosette pattern. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its showy blooms."
