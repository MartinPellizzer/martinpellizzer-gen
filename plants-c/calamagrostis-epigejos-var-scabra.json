    "intro": "Calamagrostis epigejos var. scabra, commonly known as the rough false sweetgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically brown or beige in color. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as wetlands and marshes, and is often found in the northern United States and Canada. Its botanical features make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a potential candidate for ecological restoration projects."
