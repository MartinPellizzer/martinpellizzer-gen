It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers during the growing season. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Cotyledon samium is popular as a houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
