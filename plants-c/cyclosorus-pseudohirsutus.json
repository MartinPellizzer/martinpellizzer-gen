    "intro": "Cyclosorus pseudohirsutus, commonly known as the hairy cyclosorus, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically divided into four lobes, giving it a distinctive four-leaf clover-like appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches, where it can anchor itself with its rhizomes. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the leaves, facilitating spore dispersal. Cyclosorus pseudohirsutus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
