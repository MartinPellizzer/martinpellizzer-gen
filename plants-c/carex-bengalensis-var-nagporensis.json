    "intro": "Carex bengalensis var. nagporensis, commonly known as the Nagpore sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. Native to the Indian subcontinent, this plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland habitats."
