    "intro": "Cattleya labiata f. candida, commonly known as the White Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, white flowers with a subtle pink or lavender tinge, which bloom in late summer or early autumn. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are broad and dark green, often arranged in a fan-like pattern. This cultivar is highly valued for its beauty and is a popular choice in orchid collections and floral arrangements."
