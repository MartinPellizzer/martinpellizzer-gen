    "intro": "Cardamine asarifolia var. diversifolia, commonly known as the variable water crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, trifoliate leaves that often exhibit variegation. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a dense inflorescence. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. The leaves and stems are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, giving them a distinctive appearance."
