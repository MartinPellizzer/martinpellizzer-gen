    "intro": "Copelandiopteris, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. These plants are characterized by their large, broad fronds that are often divided into segments, giving them a distinctive, feathery appearance. They are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Copelandiopteris species have rhizomes that produce both roots and new growth, contributing to their ability to spread and establish in suitable habitats. Their spore-producing structures, called sori, are usually located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns."
