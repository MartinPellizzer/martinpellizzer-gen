    "intro": "Cynara humilis var. reflexa, commonly known as the Spanish thistle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and large, lobed leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in a cluster, which are followed by spiny, spherical fruits. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Due to its prickly nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but is also valued in traditional herbal medicine."
