    "intro": "Calyptranthes musciflora, commonly known as the woolly calyptranthes, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Calyptranthes musciflora is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
