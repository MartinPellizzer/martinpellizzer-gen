    "intro": "Cyperus atriceps, commonly known as black rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as swamps, ditches, and along waterways. Its dark purple or blackish inflorescence is a distinguishing feature, giving it its common name. Cyperus atriceps is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
