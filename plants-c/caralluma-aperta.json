It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes and potatoes, and is characterized by its succulent leaves and tubular flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its fleshy stems. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Caralluma aperta is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
