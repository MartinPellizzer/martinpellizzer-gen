    "intro": "Crataegus cerea, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its thorny branches, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries known as haws, which are edible but often used in jams and wines. Crataegus cerea is valued for its ornamental appeal and has historical uses in herbal medicine for its cardiovascular benefits."
