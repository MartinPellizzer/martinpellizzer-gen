    "intro": "Cyathea bisquamata, commonly known as the two-scale tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night due to the presence of bioluminescent bacteria. This unique trait makes it a striking and rare plant in its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
