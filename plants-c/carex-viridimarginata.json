    "intro": "Carex viridimarginata, commonly known as green-margin sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves that are typically bright green with a lighter green margin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically found in dense clusters along the upper part of the stems. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Carex viridimarginata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
