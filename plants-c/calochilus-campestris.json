    "intro": "Calochilus campestris, commonly known as the field spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, spider-like flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with red or purple markings. The plant produces a single or few flowers per stem, which bloom during the autumn season. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Calochilus campestris is a short-lived perennial, with a life cycle that includes a period of dormancy during the hotter months."
