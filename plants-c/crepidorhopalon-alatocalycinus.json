    "intro": "Crepidorhopalon alatocalycinus, commonly known as the golden spire orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant has a complex root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires specific conditions to ensure successful propagation. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
