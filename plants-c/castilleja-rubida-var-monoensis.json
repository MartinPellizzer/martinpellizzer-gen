    "intro": "Castilleja rubida var. monoensis, commonly known as the Mono lake red paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, bright red to orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements make it a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
