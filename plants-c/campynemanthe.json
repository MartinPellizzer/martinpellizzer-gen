    "intro": "Campynemanthe, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical Africa. These plants are characterized by their velvety, dark green leaves and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. They are typically grown as houseplants due to their preference for warm, humid environments. Campynemanthe species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are relatively easy to care for with proper light and watering. The plants thrive in well-draining soil and benefit from regular fertilization during the growing season."
