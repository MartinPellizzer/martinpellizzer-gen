    "intro": "Choristigma, commonly known as the \"false orchid,\" is a unique plant with distinctive botanical features. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, but unlike typical orchids, it lacks the characteristic pseudobulbs and has a more herbaceous structure. The plant exhibits a sympodial growth pattern, with each node producing a new shoot. Its leaves are usually linear and arranged in a spiral, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Choristigma is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments."
