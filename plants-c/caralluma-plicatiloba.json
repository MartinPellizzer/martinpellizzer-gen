    "intro": "Caralluma plicatiloba, commonly known as the pleated devil's backbone, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of India and Pakistan. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, spine-tipped stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, minimizing water loss. Caralluma plicatiloba is also known for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
