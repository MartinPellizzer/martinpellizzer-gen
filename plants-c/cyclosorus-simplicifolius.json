    "intro": "Cyclosorus simplicifolius, commonly known as the simple-leaved cyclosorus, is a lesser-known member of the fern family. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are responsible for spore dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of ecosystem health."
