It features palmate leaves with a distinctive hairy texture on both surfaces, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. The hairy croton is also valued as an ornamental plant due to its striking leaf patterns and adaptability to various growing conditions."
