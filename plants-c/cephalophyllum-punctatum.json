    "intro": "Cephalophyllum punctatum, commonly known as the spotted headplant, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to the arid regions of Central America. It is a low-growing, perennial shrub characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant's unique feature is its dense, woolly covering of white or grayish hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in dry, warm climates."
