    "intro": "Coelorachis khasiana, commonly known as the Khasi orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the northeastern region of India. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces strikingly colored flowers with a unique orchid shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within the dense forests of its native habitat. Its flowers are often fragrant and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Coelorachis khasiana is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
