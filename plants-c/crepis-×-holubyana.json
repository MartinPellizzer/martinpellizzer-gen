It is characterized by its distinctive yellow composite flowers and basal rosettes of linear, hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is found in Europe and parts of Asia. It produces achene fruits enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations across its geographic distribution."
