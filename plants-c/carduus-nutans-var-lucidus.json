    "intro": "Carduus nutans var. lucidus, commonly known as the shining thistle, is a variant of the common thistle characterized by its glossy, waxy leaves. It is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically spiny and arranged in a rosette pattern, providing structural defense against herbivores. The varietal name \"lucidus\" refers to the shiny, reflective surface of its foliage."
