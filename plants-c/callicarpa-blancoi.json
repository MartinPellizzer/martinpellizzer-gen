It is characterized by its clusters of bright purple berries that appear in the fall, making it a striking ornamental plant. The plant has opposite, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, often found in forest understories. The berries are not only visually appealing but also serve as a food source for various birds and small mammals."
