    "intro": "Chondrilla stricta, commonly known as the rigid goatweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant has a sprawling growth habit with woody stems that become more rigid with age. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Chondrilla stricta produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
