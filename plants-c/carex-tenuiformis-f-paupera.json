    "intro": "Carex tenuiformis f. paupera, commonly known as the slender form of the narrowleaf sedge, is a low-growing, clump-forming plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy, with a distinctive, upright flowering spike that produces small, spikelet-like flowers. This variety is characterized by its reduced leaf size and compact growth habit, making it a striking addition to rock gardens or woodland settings. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, and is often used in horticultural designs for its ornamental value and ecological benefits. The plant is also valued for its ability to thrive in challenging environments, contributing to soil stabilization and biodiversity in natural habitats."
