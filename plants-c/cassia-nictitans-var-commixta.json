    "intro": "Cassia nictitans var. commixta, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking clusters of yellow, pendulous flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant produces long, narrow leaves with a slightly serrated edge, and its bark is smooth and light-colored. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental species in warm climates. The seeds are encased in a pod that splits open to release the seeds, aiding in its natural dispersal."
