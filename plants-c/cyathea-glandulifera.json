    "intro": "Cyathea glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate fronds. The fronds are typically dark green and can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. Cyathea glandulifera thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
