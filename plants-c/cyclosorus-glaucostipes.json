    "intro": "Cyclosorus glaucostipes, commonly known as the blue-stemmed water clover, is a rare aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, rounded leaves that form dense mats on the water surface. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, waxy coating that gives them a bluish sheen. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality."
