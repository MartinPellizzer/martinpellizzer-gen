    "intro": "Cardamine austriaca, commonly known as Austrian watercress, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its small, white flowers are arranged in a raceme and bloom in early spring. The entire plant is often used in herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
