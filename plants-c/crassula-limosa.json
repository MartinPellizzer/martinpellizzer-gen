    "intro": "Crassula limosa, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
