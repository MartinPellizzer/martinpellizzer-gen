    "intro": "Cephalomanes atrovirens f. kingii, commonly known as the King's black-headed flatworm, is a species of flatworm belonging to the family Planariidae. It is characterized by its elongated, flattened body and a dark, almost black head region. This organism is typically found in moist environments such as soil or under rocks, where it feeds on small invertebrates. Its body is covered in cilia, which aid in movement and feeding. The species is notable for its ability to regenerate lost body parts, a trait common among many flatworms."
