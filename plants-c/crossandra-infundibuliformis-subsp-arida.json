    "intro": "Crossandra infundibuliformis subsp. arida, commonly known as the desert crossandra, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces vibrant orange to yellow flowers during the rainy season, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping."
