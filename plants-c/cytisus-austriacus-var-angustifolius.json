    "intro": "Cytisus austriacus var. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broom, is a flowering shrub native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It features slender, often multi-branched stems that are covered in short, grayish hairs. The leaves are narrow, linear, and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Small yellow flowers appear in loose racemes during late spring to early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky and sandy soils."
