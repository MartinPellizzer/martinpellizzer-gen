    "intro": "Cereus merkeri, commonly known as the Merker's night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and spiny, ribbed structure, which helps it conserve water in its natural habitat. The plant produces large, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in full sun with minimal water. Cereus merkeri is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and unique blooming behavior."
