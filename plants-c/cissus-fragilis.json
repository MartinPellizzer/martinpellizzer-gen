    "intro": "Cissus fragilis, commonly known as the Fragile Creeper, is a climbing plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Vitaceae and is characterized by its thin, flexible stems that allow it to climb various surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red berries that are edible for humans and animals. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cissus fragilis is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to different growing environments."
