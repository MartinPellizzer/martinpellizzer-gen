    "intro": "Calophyllum horstii, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Africa. It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, often aromatic bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The tree produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in carpentry and furniture making. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
