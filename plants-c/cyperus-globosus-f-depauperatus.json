It features small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate wet conditions, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
