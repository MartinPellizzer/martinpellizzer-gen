    "intro": "Celaena, commonly known as the false mallow, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or subshrubs, characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, often pink or red flowers. Celaena species are native to regions in Africa, Australia, and the Pacific Islands, thriving in tropical and subtropical climates. The flowers are usually borne in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant's fibrous stems and leaves have been used traditionally in some cultures for medicinal or practical purposes."
