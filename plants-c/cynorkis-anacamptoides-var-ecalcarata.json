    "intro": "Cynorkis anacamptoides var. ecalcarata, commonly known as the African orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to southern Africa. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with elliptical leaves that are often covered in a dense, white to yellowish pubescence. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically arranged in a raceme. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
