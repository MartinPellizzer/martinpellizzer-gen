    "intro": "Connarus grandifolius, commonly known as the large-leaved connarus, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, glossy, elliptical leaves that are often arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
