    "intro": "Colima tuitensis, commonly known as the Tuit\u00e9n Valley cactus, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the Tuit\u00e9n Valley in the state of Colima, Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a compact, rounded shape and produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure, making it adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, Colima tuitensis is considered a species of conservation concern. Its unique botanical features make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
