    "intro": "Cavendishia megabracteata, commonly known as the giant bract orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, showy bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow orchid-like flowers, which are often hidden beneath the vibrant bracts. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for collectors and botanical gardens."
