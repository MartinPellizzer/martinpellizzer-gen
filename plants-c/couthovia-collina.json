    "intro": "Couthovia collina, commonly known as the hillside couthovia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, often branching near the top. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lanceolate, with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Couthovia collina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with full sun exposure."
