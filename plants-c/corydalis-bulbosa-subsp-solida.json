    "intro": "Corydalis bulbosa subsp. solida, commonly known as the solid corydalis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western China. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of delicate, spurred flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. Its root system consists of tubers, which are adapted for storage and survival in its alpine habitat. Corydalis bulbosa subsp. solida is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated in rock gardens and shady borders."
