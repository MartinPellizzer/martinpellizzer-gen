It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has small, pinnate leaves and is adapted to coastal and sandy environments. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some areas outside its native range."
