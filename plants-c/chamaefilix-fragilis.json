    "intro": "Chamaefilix fragilis, commonly known as the fragile rockfoam, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Cupuliferae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form. The plant features small, dark green, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are borne in dense, terminal clusters and are typically pink or purple in color. Chamaefilix fragilis is adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor, rocky soils."
