    "intro": "Chondrilla viscosa, commonly known as desert hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows from 10 to 30 centimeters in height, characterized by its rough, hairy stems and basal rosette of leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Chondrilla viscosa is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in some agricultural areas."
