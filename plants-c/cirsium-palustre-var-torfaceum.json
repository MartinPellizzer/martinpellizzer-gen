    "intro": "Cirsium palustre var. torfaceum, commonly known as the bog thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It features a tall, spiny stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting large, heart-shaped leaves with rough, hairy surfaces. The plant produces purple to pinkish-purple flower heads, which are composed of many small florets arranged in a spherical shape. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils. It plays an important ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland biodiversity."
