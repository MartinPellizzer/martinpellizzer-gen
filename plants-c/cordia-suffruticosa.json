    "intro": "Cordia suffruticosa, commonly known as the red cedar or white cedar, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by fleshy, orange-red berries that are an important food source for birds and mammals. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or lowland forests. Cordia suffruticosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in various cultures."
