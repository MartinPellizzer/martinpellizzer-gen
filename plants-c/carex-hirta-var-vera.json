    "intro": "Carex hirta var. vera, commonly known as the tall sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, consist of small, greenish-brown flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Carex hirta var. vera is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
