    "intro": "Croton stipuliformis, commonly known as the stipule croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, giving it a unique and ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by bright orange or red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its striking foliage, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens."
