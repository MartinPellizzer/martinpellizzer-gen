    "intro": "Cenchrus gracilescens, commonly known as slender sand couch, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and efficient water use. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts."
