It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many economically important plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, elliptical leaves with a waxy surface. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries. The bark of Cinchona herbacea contains alkaloids, including quinine, which has historically been used in the treatment of malaria."
