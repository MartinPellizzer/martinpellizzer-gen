    "intro": "Cornus controversa, commonly known as the red osier dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking red twigs that become visible in winter, contrasting with its showy white flowers in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its foliage turns vibrant shades of yellow and orange in the fall, adding ornamental value to landscapes. Cornus controversa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
