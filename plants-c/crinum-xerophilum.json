    "intro": "Crinum xerophilum, commonly known as the desert lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features tall, slender stems with showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water. Its bulbs are underground, allowing it to endure periods of drought. Crinum xerophilum is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in low-water environments."
