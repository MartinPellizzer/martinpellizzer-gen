    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 helvola subsp. tetrastachya, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland restoration projects."
