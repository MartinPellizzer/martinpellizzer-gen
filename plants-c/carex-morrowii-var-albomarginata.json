    "intro": "Carex morrowii var. albomarginata, commonly known as the White-margin sedge, is a perennial plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, strap-shaped leaves. The plant produces spikes of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its white margins on the leaf blades make it visually distinct and suitable for wetland gardens or naturalized landscapes."
