    "intro": "Callista conostalyx, commonly known as the silky rainforest vine, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of northern Australia. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, winged fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found climbing trees or shrubs in the understorey of dense rainforest habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
