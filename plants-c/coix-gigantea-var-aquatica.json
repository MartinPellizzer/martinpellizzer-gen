    "intro": "Coix gigantea var. aquatica, commonly known as water bamboo or giant watergrass, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, with rhizomes that spread horizontally beneath the water surface. Its inflorescence consists of small, clustered spikelets that produce both male and female flowers. The plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing water bodies."
