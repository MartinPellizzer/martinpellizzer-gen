    "intro": "Carex leucochlora var. leucochlora, commonly known as the white-flowered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of the stems, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
