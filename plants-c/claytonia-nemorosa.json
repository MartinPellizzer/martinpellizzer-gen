    "intro": "Claytonia nemorosa, commonly known as the mountain sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the forests of North America. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its flowers are typically clustered in a spike, and the plant is known for its ability to tolerate wet soils. Claytonia nemorosa is also valued for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, slightly sour flavor."
