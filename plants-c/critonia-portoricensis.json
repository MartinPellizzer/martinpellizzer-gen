    "intro": "Critonia portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. It has heart-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. Due to habitat loss and other environmental pressures, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
