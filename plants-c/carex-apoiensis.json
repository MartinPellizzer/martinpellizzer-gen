It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. This plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinct midrib, and it produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated.
