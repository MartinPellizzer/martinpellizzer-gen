    "intro": "Cephalanthera damasonium, commonly known as the early purple orchid, is a terrestrial orchid belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is notable for its lack of chlorophyll, relying instead on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in areas with rich, humusy soil. Due to its ecological significance and aesthetic appeal, it is a protected species in many regions."
