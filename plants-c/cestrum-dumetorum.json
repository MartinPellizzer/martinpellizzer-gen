It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in the evening and emit a strong, sweet scent. Its fruits are red, fleshy berries that contain seeds, and the plant is known for its ornamental value in gardens.
