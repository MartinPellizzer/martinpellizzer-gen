    "intro": "Cryptocarya vaccinioides, commonly known as the broad-leaved cryptocarya, is a species of flowering plant in the Lauraceae family. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often tinged with red on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
