It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, often found in regions with a Mediterranean climate. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and linear, giving it a distinctive appearance, and it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. The species is also valued for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and its resilience to coastal conditions."
