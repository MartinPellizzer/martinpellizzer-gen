    "intro": "Carex demissa subsp. cedercreutzii, commonly known as the Cedercreutz sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to northern regions of Europe and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often in wetlands or along the edges of ponds and lakes. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats."
