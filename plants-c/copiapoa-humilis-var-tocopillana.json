    "intro": "Copiapoa humilis var. tocopillana, commonly known as the Tocopilla cactus, is a low-growing, spineless cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It features a cylindrical stem that is often ribbed and covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
