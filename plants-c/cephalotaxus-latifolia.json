It features a distinctive, slow-growing, conical shape with dense, scale-like foliage that remains green throughout the year. The plant produces small, reddish berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its bark is thick and scaly, often with a reddish or brownish hue. Cephalotaxus latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
