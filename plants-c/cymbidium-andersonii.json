    "intro": "Cymbidium andersonii, commonly known as the Anderson's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is a sympodial orchid, meaning it grows in a branching pattern with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces tall, erect stems that bear numerous lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Cymbidium andersonii is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its beauty and fragrance."
