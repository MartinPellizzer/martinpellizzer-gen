It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along stream edges. The plant features grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, three-lobed flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
