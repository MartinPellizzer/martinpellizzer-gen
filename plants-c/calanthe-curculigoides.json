    "intro": "Calanthe curculigoides, commonly known as the golden calanthe, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, strap-like leaves and showy, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense clumps over time. The flowers are often pollinated by insects, particularly bees, making it an important component of local ecosystems."
