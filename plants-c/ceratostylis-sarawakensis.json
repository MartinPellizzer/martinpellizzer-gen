It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has a short, creeping rhizome. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
