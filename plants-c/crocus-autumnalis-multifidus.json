    "intro": "Crocus autumnalis multifidus, commonly known as the autumn crocus or meadow crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous base, and its flowers are typically arranged in a loose cluster. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The plant is noted for its ability to naturalize and spread over time, creating dense clusters of flowers."
