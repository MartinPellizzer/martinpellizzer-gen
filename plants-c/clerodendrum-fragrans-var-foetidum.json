It is characterized by its fragrant, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. However, its strong, unpleasant odor when in bloom can make it less desirable in some garden settings."
