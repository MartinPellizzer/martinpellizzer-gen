    "intro": "Colymbada reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed water shield, is a small aquatic plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands. The plant has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are often folded or reflexed at the edges, giving it its common name. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with four petals that are usually white or pale pink. Colymbada reflexa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish."
