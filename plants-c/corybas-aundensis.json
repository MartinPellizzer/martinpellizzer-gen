    "intro": "Corybas aundensis, commonly known as the New Zealand Christmas Orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the North Island of New Zealand. It is characterized by its striking, hood-like flower that resembles a Christmas hat, hence its common name. The plant is a terrestrial orchid with a short, stocky stem and a single, showy inflorescence that blooms in late summer to early autumn. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a dark red or purple lip, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
