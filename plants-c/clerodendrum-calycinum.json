It is characterized by its woody stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous small, hairy seeds. Clerodendrum calycinum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
