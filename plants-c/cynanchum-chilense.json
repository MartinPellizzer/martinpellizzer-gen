    "intro": "Cynanchum chilense, commonly known as Chilean milkweed, is a perennial herb native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its milky sap. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Cynanchum chilense is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments."
