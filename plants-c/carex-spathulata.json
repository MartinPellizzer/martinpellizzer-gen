    "intro": "Carex spathulata, commonly known as broad-leaf sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and triangular stems. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown to greenish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Carex spathulata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
