    "intro": "Conophytum minimum, commonly known as the \"Little Cone Plant,\" is a small, succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, rounded body with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, typical of succulents. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
