    "intro": "Carolinella, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a rare and unique plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped inflorescence that resembles a ghostly face. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in high-altitude, humid environments with poor soil conditions. Its flowers are typically bright red or orange, attracting specific pollinators such as hummingbirds and moths. Due to its limited distribution and endangered status, Carolinella is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
