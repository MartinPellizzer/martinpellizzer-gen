    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 kuekenthalii, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Carex aquatilis and Carex lyngbyei, making it a fascinating example of natural hybridization. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and stream banks, where it thrives in partially shaded to sunny conditions. Its foliage is grass-like, with narrow, grass-green leaves that form dense clumps, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. While it does not produce viable seeds, it is often propagated through rhizomes, making it a popular choice for wetland restoration projects."
