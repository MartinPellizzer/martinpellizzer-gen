    "intro": "Conocarpus hirtus, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhizophoraceae. It is native to the coastal regions of the Americas, particularly from the southern United States to northern Argentina. This plant is characterized by its salt-excreting leaves, which help it thrive in saline environments. Its roots form a complex network that stabilizes coastal sediments and prevents erosion. The white mangrove plays a vital role in mangrove ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
