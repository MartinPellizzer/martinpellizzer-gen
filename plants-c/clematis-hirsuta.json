It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, often covered in fine, hairy texture. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Clematis hirsuta is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to climb trellises or walls."
