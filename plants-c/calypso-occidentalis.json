    "intro": "Calypso occidentalis, commonly known as the western calypso, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant has a slender, terrestrial rhizome and produces delicate, grass-like leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, it is considered a vulnerable species."
