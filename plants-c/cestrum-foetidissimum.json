    "intro": "Cestrum foetidissimum, commonly known as the stinkbush or foul-smelling trumpet vine, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, which attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. Its most notable characteristic is the strong, unpleasant odor it emits, especially at night, which is thought to deter herbivores. Despite its pungent scent, it is valued for its ornamental flowers and ability to thrive in various environmental conditions."
