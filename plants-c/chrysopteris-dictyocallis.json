    "intro": "Chrysopteris dictyocallis, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that allow it to absorb water and nutrients from its host. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered together. Its leaves are usually scale-like and lack true stomata, which is a distinctive botanical feature. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid environments."
