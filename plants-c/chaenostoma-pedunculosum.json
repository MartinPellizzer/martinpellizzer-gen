It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves that are arranged in a floating or submerged pattern. Its flowers are tiny and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, often with four petals. It plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
