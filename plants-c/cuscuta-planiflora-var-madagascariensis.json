    "intro": "Cuscuta planiflora var. madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to Madagascar. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, using specialized structures called haustoria to attach to and extract resources from its host. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that twine around its host. It is often found growing on shrubs and trees in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical significance lies in its unique parasitic lifestyle and its role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
