    "intro": "Cupressus nootkatensis var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow-cedar, is a variant of the Alaska cedar native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. This evergreen conifer is characterized by its unique yellowish-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The leaves are scale-like and closely arranged, forming dense, compact clusters on the branches. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in cooler, temperate climates. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in construction and basket-making."
