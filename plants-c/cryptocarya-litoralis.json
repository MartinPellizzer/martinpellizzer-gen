    "intro": "Cryptocarya litoralis, commonly known as the coastal cryptocarya, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its fruits are woody capsules that split open to release small, black seeds. Cryptocarya litoralis thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and dunes."
