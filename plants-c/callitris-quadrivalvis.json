    "intro": "Callitris quadrivalvis, commonly known as the White Cypress-pine, is a coniferous tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and its distinctive, scale-like leaves arranged in four rows along the branches. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often forming dense, windbreak-like stands. The species is well adapted to withstand drought and fire, making it an important component of its native ecosystem."
