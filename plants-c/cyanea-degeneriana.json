    "intro": "Cyanea degeneriana, commonly known as the Hawaiian sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows along coastal areas and in wetlands, thriving in humid, tropical climates. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Cyanea degeneriana plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing nectar for native pollinators."
