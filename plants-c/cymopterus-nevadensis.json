    "intro": "Cymopterus nevadensis, commonly known as the mountain lomatium, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and alpine environments, thriving in cool, dry climates. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats. Cymopterus nevadensis is often found in open meadows and along mountain slopes at higher elevations."
