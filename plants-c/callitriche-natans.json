    "intro": "Callitriche natans, commonly known as floating carpetgrass, is a small aquatic plant found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It has tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged in a dense, carpet-like formation on the water surface. The plant produces small, green flowers that are often submerged, though they may occasionally emerge above the water. It is an annual herb that spreads through rapid vegetative reproduction. Its presence indicates good water quality and is often found in ponds, ditches, and wetlands."
