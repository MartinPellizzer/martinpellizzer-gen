    "intro": "Callitriche heteropoda, commonly known as the variable water-starwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Callitrichaceae. It is characterized by its floating or submerged leaves that are typically oval or elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and ditches. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction make it a common and persistent species in wetland habitats."
