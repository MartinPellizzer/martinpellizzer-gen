    "intro": "Cereus candelabrius, commonly known as the candlestick cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a tall, columnar cactus with a distinctive branching pattern that resembles a candlestick, hence its common name. The plant features thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, appearing at the ends of the branches during the night. Cereus candelabrius is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and resilience."
