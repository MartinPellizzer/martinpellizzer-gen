    "intro": "Crataegus inanis, commonly known as the slender hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched structure. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are elliptical with serrated edges and turn yellow in autumn. Crataegus inanis is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
