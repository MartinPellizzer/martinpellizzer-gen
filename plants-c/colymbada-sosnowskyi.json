    "intro": "Colymbada sosnowskyi, commonly known as Sosnowsky's hogweed, is a tall biennial plant native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant contains phototoxic compounds in its sap, which can cause severe skin irritation upon exposure to sunlight. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and in open woodlands. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
