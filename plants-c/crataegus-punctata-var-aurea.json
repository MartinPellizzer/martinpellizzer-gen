It is characterized by its yellowish-orange flowers that appear in clusters, adding a striking visual element in spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits in the fall, which are edible but often tart. Its leaves are oval with serrated edges, and the bark is smooth and grayish in color. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal interest."
