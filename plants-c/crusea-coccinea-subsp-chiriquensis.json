    "intro": "Crusea coccinea subsp. chiriquensis, commonly known as the Chiriqu\u00ed crimson bellflower, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant red, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a bold visual element to its natural habitat. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within cloud forests, where it thrives in the undergrowth. Its foliage consists of broad, glossy leaves that help it capture limited sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
