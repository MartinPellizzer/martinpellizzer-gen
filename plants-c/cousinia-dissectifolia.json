    "intro": "Cousinia dissectifolia, commonly known as the dissected cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are finely dissected, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a compact cluster at the end of each stem. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. Cousinia dissectifolia is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
