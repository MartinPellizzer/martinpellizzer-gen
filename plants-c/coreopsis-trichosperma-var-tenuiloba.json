    "intro": "Coreopsis trichosperma var. tenuiloba, commonly known as narrowleaf coreopsis, is a perennial herb native to the eastern and central United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow, daisy-like flowers with ray florets and a central disk, blooming from late spring to early fall. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with toothed margins, and are arranged alternately along the stem. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in full sun to partial shade."
