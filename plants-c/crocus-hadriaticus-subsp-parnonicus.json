It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded locations. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its early blooming habit."
