    "intro": "Ctenopteris pycnophylla, commonly known as the dense-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near water bodies. Its fronds are bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give it a lush, bushy appearance. Ctenopteris pycnophylla is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in aquatic habitats."
