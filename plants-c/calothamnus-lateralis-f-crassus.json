It features lance-shaped, glossy green leaves that are broader than the typical form of the species. The plant produces striking red to orange flowers in cylindrical spikes, which appear during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, making it a hardy choice for dry gardens. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and drought tolerance in landscaping."
