    "intro": "Cerastium boissieri var. lanuginosum, commonly known as the woolly mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. The leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy texture, giving the plant its \"woolly\" appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This plant is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
