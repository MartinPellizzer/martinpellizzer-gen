    "intro": "Carex leersii, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with triangular, often ribbed stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Native to North America, particularly the eastern United States, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes, typically in late spring to early summer. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
