    "intro": "Cousinia cataonica, commonly known as the Armenian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features slender, upright stems covered in dense, woolly hairs, which help protect it from harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a basal rosette, and the plant is well adapted to rocky and arid soils. Cousinia cataonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
