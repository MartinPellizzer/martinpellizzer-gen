    "intro": "Cissus javana var. amplifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf grape ivy, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are broader than those of the typical Cissus javana. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, grape-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Its vigorous growth makes it suitable for vertical gardening and indoor decoration."
