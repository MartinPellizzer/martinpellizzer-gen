    "intro": "Coelogyne apiculata, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow and green striped flowers, which bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a white, waxy coating. Coelogyne apiculata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
