    "intro": "Curcuma latiflora, commonly known as the broad-flowered turmeric, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its large, showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The plant produces rhizomes that are similar in appearance to turmeric but are often used in traditional medicine and as a spice. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. Curcuma latiflora is also valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens."
