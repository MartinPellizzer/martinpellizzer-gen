    "intro": "Cinchona lancifolia var. discolor, commonly known as the yellow cinchona, is a species native to the Andean region of South America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant is notable for its production of alkaloids, particularly quinine, which has historically been used in the treatment of malaria. Its yellow flowers, which bloom in spring, add ornamental value, making it a sought-after plant in botanical gardens. The varietal form 'discolor' refers to its distinctive color variations in both foliage and floral displays."
