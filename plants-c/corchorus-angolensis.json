    "intro": "Corchorus angolensis, commonly known as the African marshmallow, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. Corchorus angolensis is also valued for its mucilaginous properties, making it useful in traditional medicine and as a food source."
