    "intro": "Colythrum latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf cow-wheat, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. It has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the pods, contributing to its spread in natural habitats."
