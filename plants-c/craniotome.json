    "intro": "Craniotome, commonly known as the skull-splitting tool, is not a plant but a surgical instrument used in medical procedures. It is not botanically classified as a plant species and therefore does not have botanical characteristics. The term \"craniotome\" refers to a mechanical device, not a flora. As such, it does not possess roots, stems, leaves, or any other plant structures. There is no botanical study related to its growth, reproduction, or biological classification."
