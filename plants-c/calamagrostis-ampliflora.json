    "intro": "Calamagrostis ampliflora, commonly known as the broadleaf tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and wide, blade-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or blue at the edges. The plant produces panicles of small, fluffy flowers in late summer to early fall, which are highly ornamental. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal, it is also cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
