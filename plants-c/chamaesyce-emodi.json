It belongs to the family Portulacaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to arid environments. It has a low-growing habit, often forming dense mats, and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy and resilient plant."
