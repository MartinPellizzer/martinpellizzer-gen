    "intro": "Cyclophyllum calyculatum, commonly known as the calyculated cyclophyllum, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the family Cycadaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive cyclical arrangement of leaves, which form a dense, circular pattern around the stem. The plant produces small, clustered cones that contain both male and female reproductive structures, typical of cycads. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy texture, adapted to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Cyclophyllum calyculatum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
