    "intro": "Coccoloba declinata var. minor, commonly known as the rock nettle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine, stinging hairs, which can cause irritation upon contact. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its flowers are inconspicuous, producing small, greenish-white blooms that are followed by red or orange fruits. This species is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
