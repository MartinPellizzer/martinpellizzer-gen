    "intro": "Cuscuta sandwichiana var. kailuana, commonly known as the Kailua dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to species like Acacia and Pipturus. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, thread-like stem that coils around its host. It plays a role in the unique ecological dynamics of Hawaiian ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
