    "intro": "Chamaenerion spicatum, commonly known as fireweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and showy pink to red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in open fields, and is often found in moist to wet environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Fireweed is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize areas after fires or other disturbances."
