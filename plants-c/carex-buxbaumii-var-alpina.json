    "intro": "Carex buxbaumii var. alpina, commonly known as the Alpine sedge, is a perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikelets that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in its native environment. The leaves are typically dark green and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its cold, arid habitat."
