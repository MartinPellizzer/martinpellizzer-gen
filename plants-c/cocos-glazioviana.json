    "intro": "Cocos glazioviana, commonly known as the Glaziov's coconut, is a rare and unique species of palm native to the highlands of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, tall trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into clustered fruits, each containing a single, large seed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for both horticulturists and conservationists."
