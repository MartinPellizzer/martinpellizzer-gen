    "intro": "Coris monspeliensis var. ebusitana, commonly known as the Ebusi Island bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of Ebusi in the Comoros archipelago. It is a herbaceous perennial characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in forest undergrowth or on rocky slopes. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy surface, while its flowers bloom during the wet season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
