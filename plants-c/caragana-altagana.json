    "intro": "Caragana altagana, commonly known as the tall shrub bitterbrush, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by elongated pods that contain several seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Caragana altagana is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
