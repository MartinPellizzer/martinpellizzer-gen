It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often near streams, ponds, or ditches. The plant features tiny, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, and its leaves are narrow and whorled around the stems. It is an annual plant, completing its life cycle within one growing season. The varietal form, isophylla, is distinguished by its more uniform leaf shape compared to the typical variety."
