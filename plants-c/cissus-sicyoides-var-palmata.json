It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its rapid growth rate and adaptability make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
