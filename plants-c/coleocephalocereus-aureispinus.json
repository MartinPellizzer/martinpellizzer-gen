It is a columnar cactus characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow spines and a generally green to pale blue stem. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts and gardeners in dry climates."
