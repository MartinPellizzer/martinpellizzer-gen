It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, palmate leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody pods containing edible seeds. It is valued for its latex, which is used in the production of shea butter, and for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife. Cynometra bourdillonii is also important in traditional medicine and agroforestry systems."
