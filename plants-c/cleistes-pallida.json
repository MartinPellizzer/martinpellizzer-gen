    "intro": "Cleistes pallida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pale green, hooded flowers that resemble a ghostly face, hence its common name. The plant has a unique growth habit, with a short, leafless stem and a single, showy flower that blooms in late spring. It thrives in wet, sandy soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments like pine flatwoods. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from habitat loss, Cleistes pallida is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
