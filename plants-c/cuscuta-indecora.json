    "intro": "Cuscuta indecora, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow flowers and has a vine-like structure with slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to North America and can be found on a variety of herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, contributing to its wide distribution. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental plants."
