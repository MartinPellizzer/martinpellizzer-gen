It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, while its flowers are usually white or pale yellow. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
