    "intro": "Calamagrostis epigejos var. paralias, commonly known as the seaside grass or coastal panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pale green to golden in color. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and wind, making it well adapted to coastal environments. This grass is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ecological resilience and ability to stabilize dunes."
