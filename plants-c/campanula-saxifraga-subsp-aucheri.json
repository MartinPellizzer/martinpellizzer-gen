    "intro": "Campanula saxifraga subsp. aucheri, commonly known as the Alpina bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
