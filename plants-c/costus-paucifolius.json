    "intro": "Costus paucifolius, commonly known as the little-leaf costus, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes ginger and turmeric, and is characterized by its aromatic, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces fragrant, spadix-like inflorescences. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking, colorful bracts that often display shades of red, orange, or yellow. Costus paucifolius is often cultivated in warm climates for its aesthetic appeal and can thrive in partial shade to full sun conditions."
