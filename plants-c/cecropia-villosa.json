    "intro": "Cecropia villosa, commonly known as the velvet tree, is a fast-growing tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, pale green trunk and large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Cecropia villosa is often found in disturbed habitats and is known for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with ants. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an important species in ecological succession and forest regeneration."
