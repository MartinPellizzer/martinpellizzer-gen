    "intro": "Carex serotina f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf swamp sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of greenish-yellow flowers in the summer months. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a key role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
