    "intro": "Cedrela calantas, commonly known as the Mexican mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central America and parts of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown to reddish bark and its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its strength and workability. The plant has compound leaves with alternate arrangement, and its flowers are small and clustered in panicles. Cedrela calantas produces small, round fruits that contain one or two seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland tropical forests."
