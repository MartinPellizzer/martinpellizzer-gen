It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Campanula balcanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, bell-like blooms."
