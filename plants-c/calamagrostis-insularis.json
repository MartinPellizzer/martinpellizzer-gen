    "intro": "Calamagrostis insularis, commonly known as the coastal cordgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. This plant thrives in brackish or saline environments, making it highly adaptable to coastal and wetland habitats. Its rhizomes form a dense network that helps stabilize soils and prevent erosion. Calamagrostis insularis plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining the integrity of coastal ecosystems."
