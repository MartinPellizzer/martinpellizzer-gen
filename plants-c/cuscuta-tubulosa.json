    "intro": "Cuscuta tubulosa, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is often found growing on various plants such as grasses, shrubs, and agricultural crops. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to spread widely. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental plants."
