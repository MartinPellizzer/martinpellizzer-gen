    "intro": "Circaea canadensis var. rishiriensis, commonly known as the Rishiri sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Rishiri Islands in Japan. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are arranged in a tight rosette pattern, adapted to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. It is typically found in coastal areas and is well-suited to harsh, windy environments. This variety is considered rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations."
