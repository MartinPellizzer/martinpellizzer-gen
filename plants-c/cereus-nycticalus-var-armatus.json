It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems covered in spines, which are more pronounced in the varietal form armatus. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting pollinators such as bats and moths. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant is often cultivated for its striking appearance and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
