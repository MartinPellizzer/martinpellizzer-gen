It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive crown of spines and a single, elongated stem. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
