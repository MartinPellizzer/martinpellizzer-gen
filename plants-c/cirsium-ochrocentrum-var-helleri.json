It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in arid conditions. Its foliage and flowers are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss."
