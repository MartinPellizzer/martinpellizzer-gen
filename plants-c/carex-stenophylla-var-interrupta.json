    "intro": "Carex stenophylla var. interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and wetlands, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowering spikes are usually pale green to brown, and the plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex stenophylla var. interrupta is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
