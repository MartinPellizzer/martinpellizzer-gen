    "intro": "Cinna alba, commonly known as white cinquefoil, is a perennial herb native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmately divided leaves with five lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and marshy areas. Cinna alba is a valuable plant for ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
