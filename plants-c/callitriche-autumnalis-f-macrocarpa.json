    "intro": "Callitriche autumnalis f. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited water starwort, is a semi-aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in ponds, ditches, and along the edges of streams. The plant has small, floating or submerged leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy coating. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is distinguished by its larger, more robust fruits compared to the typical form of the species."
