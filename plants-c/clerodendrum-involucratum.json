    "intro": "Clerodendrum involucratum, commonly known as the velvetleaf clerodendrum, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges and disturbed areas."
