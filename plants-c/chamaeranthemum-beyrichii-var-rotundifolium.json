    "intro": "Chamaeranthemum beyrichii var. rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaf chamaeranthemum, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, rounded foliage with broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
