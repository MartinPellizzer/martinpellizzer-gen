    "intro": "Celsia tibestica, commonly known as the Tibesti celsia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibesti Mountains in Chad. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in the summer months, producing white or pale blue petals that attract pollinators such as bees and moths. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and fragile species."
