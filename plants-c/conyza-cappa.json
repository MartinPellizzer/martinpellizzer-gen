    "intro": "Conyza cappa, commonly known as sandmat, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, white to yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Conyza cappa is often considered a weed but has some medicinal uses in traditional herbal practices."
