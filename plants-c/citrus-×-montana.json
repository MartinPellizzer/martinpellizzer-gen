    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 montana, commonly known as the trifoliate orange. It is a hybrid citrus plant originating from a cross between Poncirus trifoliata and Citrus sinensis. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets. It produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are typically not eaten due to their bitter taste but are used in horticulture for their cold hardiness. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and as a rootstock in citrus cultivation."
