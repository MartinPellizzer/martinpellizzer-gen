    "intro": "Cerastium vagans var. subnudum, commonly known as the hairy chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features prostrate stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it its common name. The leaves are oval to heart-shaped, with a hairy surface, and the flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its reduced leaf pubescence compared to the typical form of Cerastium vagans."
