    "intro": "Courtenia afzelii, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and lanceolate leaves with a slightly hairy underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or white, followed by globose, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry woodland and savanna habitats. Due to its aromatic properties, it has been traditionally used in incense and for its medicinal value."
