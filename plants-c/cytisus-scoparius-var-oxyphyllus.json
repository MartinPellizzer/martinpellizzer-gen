    "intro": "Cytisus scoparius var. oxyphyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broom, is a shrub native to western Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are narrow and leathery, with a distinctive silver-green color on the upper surface. This variety is adapted to dry, sunny habitats and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone regions."
