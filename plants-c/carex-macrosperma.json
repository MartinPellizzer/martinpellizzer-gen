    "intro": "Carex macrosperma, commonly known as the large-seeded sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinct triangular cross-section typical of sedges. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that mature into dry, three-angled berries, contributing to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
