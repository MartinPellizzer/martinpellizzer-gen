    "intro": "Commiphora lamii, commonly known as the African myrrh, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, resinous sap, which has been traditionally used for medicinal and aromatic purposes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers and has leathery, elliptical leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to semi-desert environments. The botanical features of Commiphora lamii reflect its adaptation to harsh, dry climates."
