    "intro": "Cleistes divaricata var. bifaria, commonly known as the twin-flowered cleistocarp, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that are often closed at maturity, a feature typical of cleistocarps. The plant produces small, greenish-white blooms with a strong, sweet fragrance, which attracts specific pollinators. Its leaves are broad and ovate, often with a waxy texture, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
