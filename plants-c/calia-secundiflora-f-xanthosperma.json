    "intro": "Calia secundiflora f. xanthosperma, commonly known as the yellowseed calia, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces distinctive, elongated seed capsules that contain yellowish seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, aiding in water retention. This subspecies is notable for its unique floral structure and is often found in rocky soils and sandy habitats."
