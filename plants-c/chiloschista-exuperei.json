    "intro": "Chiloschista exuperei, commonly known as the sandstone lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish thallus, which is often covered in a fine, powdery layer. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, with the algae providing photosynthetic capabilities and the fungi offering structural support and nutrient absorption. It is typically found growing on rock surfaces, especially sandstone, in regions with low humidity and high sunlight exposure. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of environmental conditions."
