    "intro": "Carex aurea var. celsa, commonly known as golden sedge, is a flowering plant in the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with a distinctive golden hue, especially in the inflorescence. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to brown flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
