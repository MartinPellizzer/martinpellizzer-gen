    "intro": "Copiapoa megarhiza subsp. echinata, commonly known as the spiny copiapoa, is a cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It has a slow growth rate and requires well-drained soil to thrive. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
