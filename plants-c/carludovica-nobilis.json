    "intro": "Carludovica nobilis, commonly known as the sacred cactus or the ghost cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in Bolivia and Argentina. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, light green stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has a thick, succulent stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss through transpiration. Carludovica nobilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
