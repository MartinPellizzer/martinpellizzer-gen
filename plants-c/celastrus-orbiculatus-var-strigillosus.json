    "intro": "Celastrus orbiculatus var. strigillosus, commonly known as the roughleaf bindweed, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features compound leaves with a rough, hairy texture on the underside, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, followed by orange-red berries that attract birds. It is often found in woodland edges and moist soils, and it can be invasive in some regions. Its botanical characteristics make it a notable species in both horticulture and ecological studies."
