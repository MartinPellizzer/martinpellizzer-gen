It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or orange. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Copisma glabrum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small insects."
