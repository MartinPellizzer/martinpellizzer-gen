    "intro": "Cheiridopsis compressa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are densely packed and often covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces yellow flowers in summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. Cheiridopsis compressa is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
