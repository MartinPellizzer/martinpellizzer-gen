    "intro": "Calceolaria collina subsp. subincisa, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada slipper orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that resemble small slippers, which are typically violet or purple in color. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, delicate stems that support its showy blooms. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and restricted geographic distribution."
