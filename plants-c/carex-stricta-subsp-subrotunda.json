    "intro": "Carex stricta subsp. subrotunda, commonly known as narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial sedge native to wetland habitats in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that mature into dark\u8910\u8272 (brownish) berries. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
