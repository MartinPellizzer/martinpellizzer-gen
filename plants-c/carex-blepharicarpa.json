    "intro": "Carex blepharicarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. The flowers are usually green or brown and are wind-pollinated, typical of many sedges."
