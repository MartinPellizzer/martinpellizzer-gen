    "intro": "Chenopodium botrys, commonly known as tumbleweed, is a flowering plant in the Amaranthaceae family. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish flowers that develop into dry, dehiscent fruits. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in disturbed soils. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through wind-dispersed seeds make it a common weed in agricultural and natural areas."
