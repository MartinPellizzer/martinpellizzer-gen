    "intro": "Creusa biplanata var. punctulata, commonly known as the spotted creusa, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a perennial herb native to certain regions of North America, typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters. Its distinctive appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it requires well-drained soil and partial to full sun. Due to its limited distribution, it is sometimes considered a rare or endangered species in its native range."
