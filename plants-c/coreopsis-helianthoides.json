    "intro": "Coreopsis helianthoides, commonly known as the yellow ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern and central United States. It features upright, branched stems that can grow up to 3 feet tall, covered with fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, daisy-like flowers with a central disk, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental value. Coreopsis helianthoides is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
