    "intro": "Chionanthus vernus, commonly known as the fringed gentian, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its showy, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges and a smooth, grayish bark. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, often found in woodland habitats. The genus name \"Chionanthus\" comes from the Greek words \"chion\" meaning snow and \"anthos\" meaning flower, referring to its snowy appearance."
