    "intro": "Crocus serotinus f. albus, commonly known as the white crocus, is a botanical variant of the autumn crocus. It is characterized by its pale to fully white flowers, which contrast with the typical purple or yellow hues of the species. This form is typically found in the Mediterranean region, where it thrives in well-drained soils and sunny to partially shaded environments. The plant produces a bulbous underground stem, and its flowers bloom in late autumn or early winter. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, early-flowering display."
