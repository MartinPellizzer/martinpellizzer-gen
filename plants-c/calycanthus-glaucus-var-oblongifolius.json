    "intro": "Calycanthus glaucus var. oblongifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sweetshrub, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink to red in color, with a distinctive, urn-shaped form. The leaves are narrow and lanceolate, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant blooms. This plant thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for gardens in USDA hardiness zones 6 through 9. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
