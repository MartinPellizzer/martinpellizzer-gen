It is a member of the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Cottonia macrostachya is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It is considered a perennial shrub and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
