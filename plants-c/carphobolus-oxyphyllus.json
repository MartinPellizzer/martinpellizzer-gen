    "intro": "Carphobolus oxyphyllus, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a common sight in desert ecosystems. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptations to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
