It features striking, red bracts that resemble cat tails, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer. Its fruit is a fleshy, yellow or orange berry that contains several seeds. Castela erecta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to dry, well-drained soils."
