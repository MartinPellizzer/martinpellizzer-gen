    "intro": "Cyperus sporobolus var. microcephalus, commonly known as the small-headed flatsedge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. Its small, clustered flower heads are usually pale green to brown, and it produces numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by water. This species is often found in disturbed areas and can be an indicator of soil moisture conditions."
