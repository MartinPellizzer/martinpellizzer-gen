    "intro": "Carpesium rivularis, commonly known as water thistle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and stream banks in North America. It features upright, spiny stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early fall. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, often nutrient-poor soils. Carpesium rivularis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small aquatic organisms."
