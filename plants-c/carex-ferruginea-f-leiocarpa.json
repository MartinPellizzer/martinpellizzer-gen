    "intro": "Carex ferruginea f. leiocarpa, commonly known as the red-haired sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spikes of small, typically brown or reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a reddish-brown hue, especially at the base, giving it its common name. This variety is distinguished by its smoother, less hairy leaves compared to the typical form of Carex ferruginea."
