    "intro": "Cornus sanguinea nothosubsp. czerniaewii, commonly known as the pink dogwood, is a hybrid subspecies native to central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive pinkish-red stems, which are particularly striking in the winter when the leaves have fallen. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking winter interest in their landscapes."
