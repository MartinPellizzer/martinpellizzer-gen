    "intro": "Clematicissus opaca, commonly known as the dark Clematis, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often velvety to the touch. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale blue, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are woody and can grow quite long, allowing it to climb trees or trellises easily. Clematicissus opaca thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
