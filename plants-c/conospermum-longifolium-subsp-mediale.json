    "intro": "Conospermum longifolium subsp. mediale, commonly known as the broad-leaf conospermum, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features dense, evergreen foliage with lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces showy, bottlebrush-like inflorescences in shades of pink to red, which bloom from late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract native pollinators."
