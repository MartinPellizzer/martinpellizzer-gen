    "intro": "Cyclosorus suprastrigosus, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit and is typically found in rocky or shaded environments. The fronds are often pinnately divided, with a distinctive, sometimes curled appearance. This plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often associated with limestone or calcareous substrates. Its spores are released from terminal clusters on the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its native habitat."
