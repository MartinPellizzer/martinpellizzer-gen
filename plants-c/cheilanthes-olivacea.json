    "intro": "Cheilanthes olivacea, commonly known as the olive fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a perennial plant characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. Native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
