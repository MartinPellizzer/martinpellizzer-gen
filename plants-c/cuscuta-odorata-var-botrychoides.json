    "intro": "Cuscuta odorata var. botrychoides, commonly known as the sweetleaf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, thread-like stems. The plant is native to North America and often infests crops and ornamental plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it can be difficult to control once established. The species is notable for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
