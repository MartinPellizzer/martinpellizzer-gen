    "intro": "Carex hispida subsp. retusa, commonly known as the broad-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has grass-like leaves that are usually broader and more robust than those of other sedges, with a rough, bristly texture. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
