    "intro": "Celsia lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf celsia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pale blue or purple, arranged in clusters at the top of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in warmer climates."
