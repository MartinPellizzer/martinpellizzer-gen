    "intro": "Chusquea egluma, commonly known as the Andean bamboo, is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is native to the highlands of South America. It is characterized by its dense, clumping growth habit and tall, slender culms that can reach up to 6 meters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in panicles, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture that makes it suitable for traditional uses. Chusquea egluma is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its ornamental and utilitarian properties."
