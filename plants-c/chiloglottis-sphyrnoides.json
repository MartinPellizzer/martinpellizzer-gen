    "intro": "Chiloglottis sphyrnoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved duckbill, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and produces a single spike of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its pollination relies on specific insect species, particularly certain types of flies. The orchid's unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important component of its native habitat."
