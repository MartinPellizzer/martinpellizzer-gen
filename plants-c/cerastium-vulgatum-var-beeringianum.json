    "intro": "Cerastium vulgatum var. beeringianum, commonly known as the Beeringian mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Arctic and alpine regions. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are densely packed along the stems, giving it a mat-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of white, five-petaled flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. This variant is distinguished by its compact growth habit and specific geographic distribution."
