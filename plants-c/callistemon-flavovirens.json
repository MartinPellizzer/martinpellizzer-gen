    "intro": "Callistemon flavovirens, commonly known as the golden bottlebrush, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow to orange-red flowers that resemble bottle brushes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, needle-like leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral display. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract birds and bees, contributing to local biodiversity."
