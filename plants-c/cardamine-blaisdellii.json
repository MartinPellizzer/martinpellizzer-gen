    "intro": "Cardamine blaisdellii, commonly known as Blaisdell's watercress, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread along the edges of water bodies, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil. Botanically, it is closely related to other members of the Ranunculaceae family, sharing similar morphological and ecological traits."
