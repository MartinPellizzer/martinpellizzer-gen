    "intro": "Cyrtandra megaphylla, commonly known as the large-leaf cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and streamside habitats. Its leaves are large, broad, and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native environment. Cyrtandra megaphylla is also notable for its role in the unique ecosystems of Hawaii, where it contributes to biodiversity and supports various pollinators."
