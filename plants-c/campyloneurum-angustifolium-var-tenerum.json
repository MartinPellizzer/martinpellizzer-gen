It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, elongated leaves that are often curved or rolled. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sporophytes, are club-shaped and arise from the leaf tips. This variety is noted for its delicate appearance and is often found in temperate regions with high humidity."
