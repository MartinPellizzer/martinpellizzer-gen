    "intro": "Cardamine pratensis f. tenuifolia, commonly known as slender water-crowfoot, is a variant of the water crowfoot species native to wet meadows and marshy areas. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of basal leaves that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in spring, arranged in a dense cluster at the end of leafless stems. Its leaves are often finely divided, and the plant is adapted to moist, nutrient-rich soils. It plays a role in supporting local insect populations and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
