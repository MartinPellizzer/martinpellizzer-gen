    "intro": "Ceruana fruticosa, commonly known as the red-flowered heath, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of vibrant red flowers in the spring, which are tubular and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its evergreen foliage and long blooming period."
