    "intro": "Calciphila galgalensis, commonly known as the Galgal Mountain rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the rocky habitats of the Galgal Mountains in Israel. It thrives in calcareous soils, showcasing its calciphile nature, which allows it to tolerate high levels of calcium. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring. Its compact growth habit and ability to survive in harsh, arid conditions make it well adapted to its environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
