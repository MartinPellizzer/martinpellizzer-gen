    "intro": "Cambessedea oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leafed camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its opposite arrangement of leaves, which are typically elliptical and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Its bark and leaves contain essential oils, making it valuable in traditional medicine and as a source of camphor. The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments within its native range."
