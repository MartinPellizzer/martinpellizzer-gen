    "intro": "Capanea andina, commonly known as the Andean capanea, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet or blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has adapted to the cool, moist conditions of mountainous environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Capanea andina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
