    "intro": "Carex tubulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, clustered in spikelets that are often subtended by bracts. Carex tubulata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
