    "intro": "Celastrus umbellatus, commonly known as the umbrella creeper, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbellate clusters, which give it its common name. These flowers are followed by red, berry-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
