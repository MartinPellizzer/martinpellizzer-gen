    "intro": "Cynosurus coloratus, commonly known as the red grass or red bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish hue, which becomes more pronounced as the plant matures. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed spikelets. Cynosurus coloratus is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its attractive color and texture."
