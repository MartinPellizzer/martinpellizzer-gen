    "intro": "Crepis mira, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, dandelion-like yellow flowers. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. The plant produces numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread. Its name reflects the silvery appearance of its leaves, which are covered in fine, hairy structures."
