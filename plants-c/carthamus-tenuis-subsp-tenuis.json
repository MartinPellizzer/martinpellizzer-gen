    "intro": "Carthamus tenuis subsp. tenuis, commonly known as the narrowleaf cornflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments."
