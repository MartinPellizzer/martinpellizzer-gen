    "intro": "Carex scabriuscula, commonly known as the rough-skinned sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clustered, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are rough to the touch, giving it its common name, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. Carex scabriuscula plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
