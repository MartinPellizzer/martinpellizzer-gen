    "intro": "Cattleya \u00d7 dukeana, commonly known as the Duke's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink and orange, with a distinctive lip that is often spotted or striped. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Cattleya \u00d7 dukeana is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its fragrant blooms and adaptability to cultivation."
