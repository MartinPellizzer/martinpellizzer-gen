    "intro": "Cordia latora, commonly known as the white cordia, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces showy, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly hairy surface. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds."
