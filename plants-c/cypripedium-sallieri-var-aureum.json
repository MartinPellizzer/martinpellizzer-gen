    "intro": "Cypripedium sallieri var. aureum, commonly known as the golden ladyslipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow and orange flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch. The plant typically grows in cool, moist forest understories, preferring shaded and well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
