    "intro": "Carum pestalozzae, commonly known as the Pestalozza's caraway, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in umbels. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in woodland areas. Its seeds are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
