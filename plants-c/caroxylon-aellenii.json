    "intro": "Caroxylon aellenii, commonly known as the African rock fig, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, round fig-like structure that contains a single seed. Caroxylon aellenii is well adapted to arid environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops."
