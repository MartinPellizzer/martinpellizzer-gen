    "intro": "Christia pierrei, commonly known as the narrowleaf christia, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and Georgia, where it thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a narrow, linear shape, giving it a distinctive appearance. Christia pierrei is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
