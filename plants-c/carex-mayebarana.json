It is native to parts of East Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes and stream banks. The plant is characterized by its grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland gardens and conservation areas."
