    "intro": "Collaea pendula, commonly known as the hanging rockrose, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, characterized by its trailing or hanging growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, often in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are small, elliptical, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Collaea pendula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
