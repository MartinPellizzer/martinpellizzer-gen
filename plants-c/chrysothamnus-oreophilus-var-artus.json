It is characterized by its yellowish-green foliage and produces small, yellow flowers in the spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in arid or semi-arid environments. It has a compact growth habit and is well adapted to dry conditions. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss."
