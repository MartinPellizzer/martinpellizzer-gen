    "intro": "Crepis rubra var. integrifolia, commonly known as the red hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright red to orange-yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically basal, with a rough, hairy texture and a slightly lobed appearance. The plant produces small, elongated achenes (seeds) that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and along roadsides."
