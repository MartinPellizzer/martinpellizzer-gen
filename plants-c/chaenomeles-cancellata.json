    "intro": "Chaenomeles cancellata, commonly known as the Japanese flowering quince, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its thick, rugged bark and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red or orange berries in the fall, which are edible but often tart. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a rough texture and serrated edges. Chaenomeles cancellata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
