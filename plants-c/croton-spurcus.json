    "intro": "Croton spurcus, commonly known as the spotted croton, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, lobed leaves that often display vibrant shades of green, red, and yellow. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, followed by orange or red berries. Croton spurcus thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
