It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. Calorophus fastigiatus thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. It plays an important role in providing food for pollinators and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds."
