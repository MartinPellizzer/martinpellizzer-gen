It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has spiny leaves that provide some protection from herbivores. Its yellow flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Caulinia guadalupensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in arid gardens."
