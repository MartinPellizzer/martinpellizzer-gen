    "intro": "Carex dawsonii, commonly known as Dawson's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. Native to North America, it typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
