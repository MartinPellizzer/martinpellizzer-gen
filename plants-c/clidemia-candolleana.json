    "intro": "Clidemia candolleana, commonly known as the white-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and showy white or pink flowers. The plant has a complex root system that allows it to attach to host trees, from which it derives some of its nutrients. Its flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its reproductive success. Clidemia candolleana is often found in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests."
