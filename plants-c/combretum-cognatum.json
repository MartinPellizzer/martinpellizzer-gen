    "intro": "Combretum cognatum, commonly known as the red-leaf combretum, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking red or orange leaves that turn vibrant during the dry season. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often found in coastal and sandy habitats. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, and it has a tendency to exude a milky sap when damaged. Combretum cognatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
