    "intro": "Chamaenerion montanum, commonly known as the mountain fireweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant produces striking pink to red flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly serrated edge. Chamaenerion montanum is also known for its ability to colonize disturbed sites, making it a common pioneer species in mountainous environments."
