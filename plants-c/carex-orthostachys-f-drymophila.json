    "intro": "Carex orthostachys f. drymophila, commonly known as the dryland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. This subspecies is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowering stems produce small, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of many sedges. The plant is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and open fields, and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
