    "intro": "Casearia cotticensis, commonly known as the red-leaf casearia, is a tropical shrub native to Central America and the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by small, fleshy fruits that are typically red when mature. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Casearia cotticensis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories."
