    "intro": "Condylocarpon obtusiusculum, commonly known as the rough leathery lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms a dense, crust-like growth on tree bark and soil. It is characterized by its dark brown to blackish thallus with a leathery texture and a distinctive, granular surface. The lichen contains a complex mixture of secondary metabolites, including depsides and depsidones, which contribute to its chemical defense and ecological role. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in temperate and subtropical regions. Its morphology and chemical composition make it an important indicator species for assessing environmental conditions."
