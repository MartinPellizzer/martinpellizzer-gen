    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna f. flore-albo-pleno, commonly known as the white-flowered hawthorn, is a cultivated form of the common hawthorn. It is characterized by its abundant white flowers that bloom in early spring, often preceding the leaves. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its flowers are borne in clusters and are highly ornamental, making it a popular choice for gardens. The fruit, which follows the flowers, is a small, red-pink berry that matures in the fall."
