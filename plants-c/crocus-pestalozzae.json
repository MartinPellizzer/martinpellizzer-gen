It is native to the mountainous regions of Italy, particularly in the Dolomites. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers with a distinctive, spurred petal at the base. It blooms in late winter to early spring, making it one of the earliest flowering plants in its habitat. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is often found growing in rocky soils."
