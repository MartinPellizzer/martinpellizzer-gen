    "intro": "Craspedaria tecta, commonly known as the tectate craspeda, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant characterized by its small, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically flat and closely arranged. The plant exhibits a distinctive morphology with a dorsiventral thallus and a well-developed central axis. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky substrates or in humid forests. Craspedaria tecta plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
