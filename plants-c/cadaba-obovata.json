    "intro": "Cadaba obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate cadaba, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically obovate in shape, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions. The leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
