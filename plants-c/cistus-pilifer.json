    "intro": "Cistus pilifer, commonly known as the hairy rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and often covered with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Cistus pilifer is well adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
