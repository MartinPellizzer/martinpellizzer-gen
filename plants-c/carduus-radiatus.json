    "intro": "Carduus radiatus, commonly known as the radiant thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and a striking purple or pink flower head composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowering period occurs during the summer months, and it is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
