    "intro": "Cullen tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly cullen, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, white tomentose (fuzzy) covering on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Cullen tomentosum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique texture and seasonal blooms."
