    "intro": "Caroxylon salsola, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant in the Amaranthaceae family. It is native to Eurasia and is characterized by its spiny, bract-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It produces a large number of seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions. Caroxylon salsola is often found in disturbed soils and can form dense stands in agricultural areas."
