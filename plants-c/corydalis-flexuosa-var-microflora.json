    "intro": "Corydalis flexuosa var. microflora, commonly known as the dwarf zigzag larkspur, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy. The flowers are delicate, ranging from pink to purple, and are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. This variety is distinguished by its compact size and unique, zigzagging stem structure. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
