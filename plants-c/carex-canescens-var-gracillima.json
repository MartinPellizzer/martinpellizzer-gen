    "intro": "Carex canescens var. gracillima, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, greenish flowers that are wind-pollinated. The plant plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
