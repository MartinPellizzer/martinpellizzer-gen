    "intro": "Conyza lanceolata, commonly known as horseweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It features slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stem. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is often found in disturbed soils, roadsides, and fields, and is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread prolifically. Conyza lanceolata is also notable for its wind-dispersed seeds, which have a pappus that allows them to travel long distances."
