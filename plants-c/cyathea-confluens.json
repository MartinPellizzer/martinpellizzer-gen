    "intro": "Cyathea confluens, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a fibrous, hairy layer that resembles bark. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Cyathea confluens thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and conservation efforts."
