    "intro": "Coccoloba riparia, commonly known as the red mangrove or mangrove hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive red, fleshy leaves and its ability to thrive in saline environments, making it a common species in mangrove ecosystems. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots form a complex network that helps stabilize coastal soils and filter water. Coccoloba riparia plays an important ecological role in supporting biodiversity in tropical wetlands and estuaries."
