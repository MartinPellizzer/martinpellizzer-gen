    "intro": "Cronquistianthus chotensis, commonly known as the Chotensian flameleaf, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, bright red foliage and small, clustered white flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has a woody stem with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is known for its unique adaptation to high-altitude conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
