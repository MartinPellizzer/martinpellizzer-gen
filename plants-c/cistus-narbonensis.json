    "intro": "Cistus narbonensis, commonly known as the Pyrenean rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern France, Spain, and northern Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, woolly leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is well adapted to rocky and dry environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil. Its evergreen nature and drought tolerance make it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Additionally, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
