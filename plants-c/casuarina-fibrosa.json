    "intro": "Casuarina fibrosa, commonly known as the silky pine, is a tropical and subtropical evergreen tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like foliage that forms dense, cylindrical clusters, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color, and it produces woody, cone-like structures that contain its seeds. Casuarina fibrosa is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and coastal areas due to its deep root system and salt tolerance. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
