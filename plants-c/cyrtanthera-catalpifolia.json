It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along the edges of streams, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slight pubescence, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to waterlogged conditions. Cyrtanthera catalpifolia plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for various pollinators."
