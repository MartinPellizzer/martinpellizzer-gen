    "intro": "Cordia platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf cordia, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas or on limestone soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
