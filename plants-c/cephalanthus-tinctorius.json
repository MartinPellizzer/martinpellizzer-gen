    "intro": "Cephalanthus tinctorius, commonly known as the redroot dogwood, is a perennial shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, red-bracted flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant has a deep red root system, which gives it its common name and is used in traditional dyeing practices. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a smooth texture with a slight waxy coating. Cephalanthus tinctorius thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
