    "intro": "Cardamine flexuosa var. fallax, commonly known as the bent-leaf water-crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, flowing waters and is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are divided into narrow, thread-like segments. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats on the water surface. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling."
