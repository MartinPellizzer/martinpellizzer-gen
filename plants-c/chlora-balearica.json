It is characterized by its delicate, blue-violet flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas. It has a compact growth habit and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
