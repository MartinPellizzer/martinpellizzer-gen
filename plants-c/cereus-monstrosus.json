It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to 10 feet in height. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers that bloom at night. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and cactus collections."
