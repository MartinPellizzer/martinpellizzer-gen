    "intro": "Convallaria fragrans, commonly known as sweet laurel, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asparagaceae. It is characterized by its fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters during late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but contain toxic compounds, making them dangerous if ingested in large quantities. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its ornamental value is often appreciated in gardens, though caution is advised due to its toxic properties."
