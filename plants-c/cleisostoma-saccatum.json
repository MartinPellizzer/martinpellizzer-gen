    "intro": "Cleisostoma saccatum, commonly known as the sac-like cleisostoma, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a sac-like pouch that encloses the reproductive organs. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its leaves are ovate and arranged in a rosette pattern, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers are small and fragrant, blooming in clusters during the wet season."
