It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its thorny stems and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by edible, fleshy fruits that are typically sour and used in local cuisines.
