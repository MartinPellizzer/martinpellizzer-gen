    "intro": "Capsella obovata, commonly known as the heartweed or roundleaf weed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Capsella obovata is typically found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and fields."
