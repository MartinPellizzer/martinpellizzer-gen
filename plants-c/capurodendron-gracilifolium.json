It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale yellow, followed by elongated, woody fruits. Its growth habit is generally shrub-like or small tree-like, with a branching structure that allows for good light penetration. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
