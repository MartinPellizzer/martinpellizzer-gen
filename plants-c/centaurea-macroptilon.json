    "intro": "Centaurea macroptilon, commonly known as the large-headed centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across open habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Centaurea macroptilon is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun."
