It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. This plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization.
