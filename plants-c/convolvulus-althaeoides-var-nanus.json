    "intro": "Convolvulus althaeoides var. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf morning glory, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features small, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in spring and early summer. The plant has trailing stems that can be grown in containers or as a ground cover, with heart-shaped leaves that are hairy and slightly lobed. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
