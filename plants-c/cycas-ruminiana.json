    "intro": "Cycas ruminiana, commonly known as the African cycad, is a species of cycad native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is considered a living fossil, with a history dating back to the Mesozoic era."
