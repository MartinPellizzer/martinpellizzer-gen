    "intro": "Cyclosorus pseudobalansae, commonly known as the tropical cyclosorus, is a member of the Cycadaceae family. It is a small, evergreen cycad characterized by its short, stout trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones, with the male cones typically appearing at the base of the plant and the female cones emerging higher up. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
