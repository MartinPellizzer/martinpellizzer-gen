    "intro": "Ceropegia perrieri, commonly known as the African violet ceropegia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and fleshy, succulent stems. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, attracting specific pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Ceropegia perrieri is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
