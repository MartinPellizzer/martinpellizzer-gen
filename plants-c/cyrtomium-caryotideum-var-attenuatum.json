    "intro": "Cyrtomium caryotideum var. attenuatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 10\u201330 cm long and have a finely toothed margin. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for shady garden settings."
