    "intro": "Coelogyne wlodarczykiana, commonly known as the Wlodarczyk's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, narrow pseudobulbs and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are often adorned with intricate patterns and are highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
