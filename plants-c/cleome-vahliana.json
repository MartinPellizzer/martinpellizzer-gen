    "intro": "Cleome vahliana, commonly known as the desert spider flower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its striking, spider-like flower clusters that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has hairy, ribbed stems and lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Cleome vahliana is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that is popular in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
