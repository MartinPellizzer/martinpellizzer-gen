    "intro": "Cwangayana, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that emit a faint golden hue under sunlight. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its host while absorbing moisture from the air. Cwangayana is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its traditional uses in herbal medicine."
