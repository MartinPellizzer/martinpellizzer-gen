    "intro": "Chiropetalum pavonianum, commonly known as the Pavonian starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its star-shaped, violet-blue petals that bloom in early spring. The plant has small, narrow leaves arranged in a spiral pattern along its stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
