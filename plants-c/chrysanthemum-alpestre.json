    "intro": "Chrysanthemum alpestre, commonly known as the alpine chrysanthemum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to yellow and orange. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and cooler climates, making it well-suited for alpine gardens. Its foliage consists of finely divided, silver-green leaves that add ornamental value throughout the growing season. Chrysanthemum alpestre is often cultivated for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
