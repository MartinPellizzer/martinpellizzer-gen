    "intro": "Cupressus torulosa var. viridis, commonly known as the Green-tipped Colorado spruce, is a variant of the Colorado spruce native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and its distinctive bluish-green foliage that turns a vibrant yellow-green in the summer. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are tightly packed along the branches, giving it a compact appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
