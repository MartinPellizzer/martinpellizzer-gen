    "intro": "Carex omiana, commonly known as the slender sedges, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along streambanks, where it forms dense, grass-like clumps. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Carex omiana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
