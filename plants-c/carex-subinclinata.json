    "intro": "Carex subinclinata, commonly known as the drooping sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Carex subinclinata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
