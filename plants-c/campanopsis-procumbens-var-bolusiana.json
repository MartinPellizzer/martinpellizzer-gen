    "intro": "Campanopsis procumbens var. bolusiana, commonly known as the Bolus's bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has a low-growing, spreading habit with hairy, narrow leaves that are often tinged with silver. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring through early autumn."
