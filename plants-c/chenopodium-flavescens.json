    "intro": "Chenopodium flavescens, commonly known as yellow goosefoot, is a herbaceous annual plant native to North America. It typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Chenopodium flavescens is also known for its edible leaves, which have a slightly tart flavor and are used in traditional cuisines."
