    "intro": "Coreopsis saxicola, commonly known as the rock coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, fluffy seed heads that add visual interest after flowering. Coreopsis saxicola is a hardy perennial that is drought-tolerant and attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
