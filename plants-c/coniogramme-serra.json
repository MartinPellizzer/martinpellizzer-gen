    "intro": "Coniogramme serra, commonly known as the serrated coniogramme, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The leaves are typically bipinnate, with a finely serrated edge that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's botanical structure reflects its adaptation to humid, low-light conditions."
