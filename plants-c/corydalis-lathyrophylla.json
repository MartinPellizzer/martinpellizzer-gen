It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It typically grows to a height of about 15\u201330 centimeters and prefers well-drained, sandy soils. Corydalis lathyrophylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in gardens with proper conditions."
