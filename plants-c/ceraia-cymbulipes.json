    "intro": "Ceraia cymbulipes, commonly known as the flatback sea hare, is a species of sea slug found in marine environments. It belongs to the family Aplysiidae and is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body and lack of a shell. The animal is typically pale in color with a distinctive flat, elongated shape. It is primarily herbivorous, feeding on algae and other marine plants. Its botanical significance lies in its role within marine ecosystems as a herbivore and its contribution to the biodiversity of coastal habitats."
