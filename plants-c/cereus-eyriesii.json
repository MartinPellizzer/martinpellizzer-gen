    "intro": "Cereus eyriesii, commonly known as the Easter Cactus, is a flowering cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its thick, segmented stems that resemble those of other cereus species. The plant produces vibrant, tubular flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with bright, indirect light. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
