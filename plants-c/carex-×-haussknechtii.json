    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 haussknechtii, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Carex acutata and Carex lyngbyei, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically forms dense, clump-forming growth with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are usually green or brown in color. Carex \u00d7 haussknechtii is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
