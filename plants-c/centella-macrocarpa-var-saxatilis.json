    "intro": "Centella macrocarpa var. saxatilis, commonly known as the rock-centella, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to rocky and arid environments. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne on short peduncles. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in rocky areas. This species is valued for its resilience and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
