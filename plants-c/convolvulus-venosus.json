    "intro": "Convolvulus venosus, commonly known as the veiny morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive veined leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant is native to southern Africa and thrives in warm, sunny environments. It produces small, spherical berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by animals and wind. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
