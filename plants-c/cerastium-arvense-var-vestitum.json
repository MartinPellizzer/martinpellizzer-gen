    "intro": "Cerastium arvense var. vestitum, commonly known as hairy mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and wildflower displays."
