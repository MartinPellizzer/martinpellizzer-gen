    "intro": "Carex feani, commonly known as the Fena sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known for their fibrous roots and cylindrical stems. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are arranged in a rosette, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer. Carex feani is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wetland organisms."
