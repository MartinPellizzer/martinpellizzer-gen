    "intro": "Cyperus filiformis var. densiceps, commonly known as the dense-headed flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are inconspicuous, and it does not produce showy blooms. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
