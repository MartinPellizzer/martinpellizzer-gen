    "intro": "Cicer longearistatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vetch, is an annual legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with elongated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by elongated, narrow pods containing several seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be an invasive species in some areas. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it beneficial for soil fertility in agricultural settings."
