    "intro": "Cautleya cathcartii, commonly known as the Cathcart's Cattleya, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white, with a distinctive, elongated lip. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
