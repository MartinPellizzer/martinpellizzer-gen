    "intro": "Cabralea sulcata, commonly known as the Brazilian sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in coastal regions. The plant features small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, usually in shades of pink or white. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Cabralea sulcata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and visual interest."
