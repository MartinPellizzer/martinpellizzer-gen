    "intro": "Cenchrus quinquevalvis, commonly known as the five-ribbed sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, cylindrical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown spikelets, which are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky areas. Cenchrus quinquevalvis plays a role in stabilizing soils and preventing erosion in its native habitats."
