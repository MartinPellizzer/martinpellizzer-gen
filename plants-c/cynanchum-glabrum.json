    "intro": "Cynanchum glabrum, commonly known as the smooth milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are usually smooth and hairless. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the Asclepiadaceae family. Its latex contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores. Cynanchum glabrum plays a role in supporting specific pollinators, though it is not as widely cultivated as other milkweed species."
