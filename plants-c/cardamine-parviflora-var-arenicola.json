    "intro": "Cardamine parviflora var. arenicola, commonly known as the sand chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to sandy or gravelly soils in temperate regions. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and small white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically reaches a height of 5 to 15 centimeters and thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread gradually, forming dense mats that stabilize loose soils. It is often found in open habitats such as dunes, rock crevices, and roadside banks."
