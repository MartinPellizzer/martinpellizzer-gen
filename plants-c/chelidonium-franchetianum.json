    "intro": "Chelidonium franchetianum, commonly known as the Franchet's greater celandine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and smooth, ribbed stems. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a poisonous plant and should be handled with care."
