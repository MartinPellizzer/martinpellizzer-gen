    "intro": "Cyperus ecklonii, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like stems and a dense cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. It thrives in wet or marshy environments and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Cyperus ecklonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in water gardens or as a ground cover in moist landscapes."
