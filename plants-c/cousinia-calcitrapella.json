    "intro": "Cousinia calcitrapella, commonly known as the rock cousinia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a perennial herb with a compact, cushion-like growth form that helps it survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which reduce water loss through transpiration. Cousinia calcitrapella is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in alpine and steppe habitats."
