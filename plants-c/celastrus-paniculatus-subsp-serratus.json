    "intro": "Celastrus paniculatus subsp. serratus, commonly known as the Indian star jasmine, is a climbing shrub native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated margins, which give it its subspecific name. The plant produces small, fragrant, white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by yellow, berry-like fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
