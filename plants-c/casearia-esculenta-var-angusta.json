    "intro": "Casearia esculenta var. angusta, commonly known as narrow-leaved casearia, is a tropical shrub native to regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by orange to red berries containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests or near riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
