    "intro": "Cyathochaeta diandra, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironwood, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, hard seeds that are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats. Cyathochaeta diandra is valued for its drought tolerance and is used in xeriscaping and erosion control."
