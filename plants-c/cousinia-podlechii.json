It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense foliage, which helps it survive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Cousinia podlechii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil."
