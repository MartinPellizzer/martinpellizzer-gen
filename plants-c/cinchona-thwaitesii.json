It is native to the highlands of South America, particularly in regions of Peru and Ecuador. The plant is notable for its ornamental value, featuring striking red and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in cloud forests. Its leaves and bark contain alkaloids, though it is not as widely used for medicinal purposes as other cinchona species."
