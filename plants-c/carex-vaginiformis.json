It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its flowering spikes, which appear in early summer, consist of small, greenish-brown flowers that are wind-pollinated.
