It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of bright red berries that persist through the winter. The plant belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Its berries are edible but typically consumed in moderation due to their tart flavor. The shrub thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
