    "intro": "Calliandra anomala var. callistemon, commonly known as the red calliandra, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery inflorescences that range in color from red to pink, which are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is often used in agroforestry and landscape design."
