    "intro": "Conocarpus racemosus, commonly known as the mangrove apple or white mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, clustered inflorescences and small, fleshy, red fruits that contain a single seed. The plant thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often forming dense stands in mangrove ecosystems. Its roots are adapted to tolerate waterlogged soil, and it plays a crucial role in coastal stabilization and biodiversity. The leaves are alternate,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss."
