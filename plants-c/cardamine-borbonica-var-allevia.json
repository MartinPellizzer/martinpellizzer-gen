    "intro": "Cardamine borbonica var. allevia, commonly known as the lesser watercress, is a perennial herb native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, with stems that are often hairy and slender. The plant produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils, making it a common sight in stream banks and wet meadows. This variety is closely related to other members of the Ranunculaceae family, sharing similar morphological traits and ecological preferences."
