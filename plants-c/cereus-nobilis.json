    "intro": "Cereus nobilis, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and ability to store water efficiently. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its slow growth rate and striking appearance make it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. The flowers typically last only one night, adding to its allure and rarity."
