    "intro": "Callitriche marginata var. lechleri, commonly known as the Amazonian water starwort, is a semi-aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that often float on the water surface, with small, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. Its flowers are tiny, white or pale blue, and are borne in clusters near the water's surface. This species plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
