    "intro": "Cardamine maritima subsp. maglicensis, commonly known as the Magli\u0107 watercress, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the mountainous regions of the Dinaric Alps. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in moist, calcareous soils, often near streams or in rocky crevices. The plant features small, trifoliate leaves and produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers. Its botanical significance lies in its restricted distribution and ecological niche, making it a subject of interest for conservation efforts. Due to habitat degradation, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for further research and protection."
