    "intro": "Chrysanthemum indicum var. boreale, commonly known as the alpine chrysanthemum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Its leaves are finely divided and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in harsh climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
