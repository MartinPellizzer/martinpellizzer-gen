It is characterized by its round, broad leaves and large, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and spreads through rhizomes, forming dense colonies. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitats."
