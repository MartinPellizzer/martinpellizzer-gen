It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its upright, sparsely branched stems and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces minute, greenish to reddish flowers that are often overlooked due to their size. Its leaves are linear and usually lack stipules, contributing to its distinctive appearance.
