    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe cochleata, commonly known as the spiral fern, is a unique tropical plant characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant features creeping rhizomes that give rise to fiddlehead-like fronds, which unfurl into lanceolate, leathery leaves. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the leaves, typical of many ferns. Crocodeilanthe cochleata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
