    "intro": "Centaurea plumosa, commonly known as the plume thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and feathery, plume-like inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Centaurea plumosa is often found in dry, sunny habitats like grasslands and rocky slopes."
