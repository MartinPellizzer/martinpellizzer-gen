    "intro": "Cypripedium ebracteatum, commonly known as the nakedleaf lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy, slipper-shaped flower that is typically pink or white in color. The plant has a distinctive lack of leaf-like bracts, giving it its common name. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
