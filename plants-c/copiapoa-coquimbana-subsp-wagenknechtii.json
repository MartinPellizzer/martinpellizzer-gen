    "intro": "Copiapoa coquimbana subsp. wagenknechtii, commonly known as the Wagenknecht's cholla, is a cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It has a slow growth rate and is adapted to thrive in arid, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
