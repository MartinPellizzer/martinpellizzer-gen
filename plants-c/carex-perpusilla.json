    "intro": "Carex perpusilla, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, making it an ideal choice for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Carex perpusilla prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
