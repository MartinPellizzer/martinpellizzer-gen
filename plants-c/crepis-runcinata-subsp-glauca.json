    "intro": "Crepis runcinata subsp. glauca, commonly known as the glaucous mouse-ear, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it well adapted to withstand drought and grazing."
