    "intro": "Cortiella lamondiana, commonly known as the Lamond's cortiella, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Teloschistaceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, encrusting layer on rock surfaces, typically in shaded, humid environments. The thallus is pale yellow to orange in color, with a distinct, granular texture. It contains the secondary metabolite atranorin, which contributes to its chemical profile and ecological interactions. This lichen is often found in temperate regions and is used in ecological studies to assess air quality and biodiversity."
