    "intro": "Convallaria majalis convar. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved lily of the valley, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red berries that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
