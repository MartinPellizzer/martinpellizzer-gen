It features prostrate or ascending stems that are covered with small, glandular hairs, giving it a slightly sticky texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are opposite, rounded, and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its characteristic appearance. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas."
