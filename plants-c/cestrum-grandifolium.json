    "intro": "Cestrum grandifolium, commonly known as the large-leaved cestrum, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a mild, sweet taste. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and pleasant nocturnal fragrance. Cestrum grandifolium is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
