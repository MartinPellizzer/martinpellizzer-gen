    "intro": "Cladodes, commonly known as leaf-like stems, are modified stems that function as leaves in certain plants. They are typically found in arid environments where water conservation is essential. These structures perform photosynthesis, just like true leaves, and often have a reduced number of stomata to minimize water loss. Cladodes are characteristic of plants such as cacti and some species of euphorbias. Their unique morphology allows them to thrive in harsh, dry conditions while maximizing light absorption."
