    "intro": "Cereus aciniformis, commonly known as the star cactus or night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its spiny, columnar stems and is known for its striking night-blooming flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its flowers are large, white, and emit a sweet fragrance, often opening at dusk. Cereus aciniformis is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
