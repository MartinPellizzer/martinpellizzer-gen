    "intro": "Cynometra warburgii, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and simple, alternate leaves. The tree produces small, pale green flowers followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
