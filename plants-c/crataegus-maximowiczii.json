It typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white or pale pink flowers in spring. The plant produces red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges or open woodlands. Crataegus maximowiczii is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local wildlife."
