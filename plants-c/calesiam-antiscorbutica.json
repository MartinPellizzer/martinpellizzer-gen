    "intro": "Calesiam antiscorbutica, commonly known as the scurvy grass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in maritime environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are rich in vitamin C, historically used to prevent scurvy, hence its common name. The species is valued for its medicinal properties and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
