It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their spiny, glandular leaves and showy, yellow to orange composite flowers. They are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep root systems and water-storing tissues. Ctenodaucus species are often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun conditions."
