    "intro": "Crataegus quercina, commonly known as the oak-leaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves that resemble those of oak trees, and its clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus quercina is often found in moist woodlands and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
