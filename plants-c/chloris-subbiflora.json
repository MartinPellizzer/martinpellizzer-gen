    "intro": "Chloris subbiflora, commonly known as slender grass or narrow-leaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three flowering branches, which are often clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Chloris subbiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in native garden landscaping."
