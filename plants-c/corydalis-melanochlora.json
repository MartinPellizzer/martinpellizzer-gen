    "intro": "Corydalis melanochlora, commonly known as the blackleaf corydalis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It features slender, hairy stems that often grow in dense clusters, with lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy on both surfaces. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming in early spring. Its flowers are characterized by two lower petals that are often darker in hue, giving the plant its common name. Corydalis melanochlora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often grown in shaded garden settings."
