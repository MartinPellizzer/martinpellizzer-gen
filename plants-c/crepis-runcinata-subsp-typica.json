It is characterized by its basal rosette of linear, hairy leaves and small, yellowish to brownish composite flowers. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this species thrives in dry, disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread. It is often found in grasslands, rocky areas, and along roadsides."
