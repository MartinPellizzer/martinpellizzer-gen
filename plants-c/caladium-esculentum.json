    "intro": "Caladium esculentum, commonly known as the arrowleaf caladium, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that come in a variety of colors, including red, white, and green. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant foliage. The leaves are edible when cooked, though the tubers are not typically consumed."
