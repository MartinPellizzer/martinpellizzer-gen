    "intro": "Crepinia benearnensis, commonly known as the Benearn's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
