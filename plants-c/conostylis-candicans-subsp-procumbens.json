    "intro": "Conostylis candicans subsp. procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate conostylis, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southeastern Australia. It features wiry, creeping stems that form dense mats, often growing along the ground or in rocky crevices. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs, and it is well adapted to arid and sandy soils. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
