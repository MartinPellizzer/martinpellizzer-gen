    "intro": "Cassuvium atrum, commonly known as the midnight bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It is characterized by its dark violet petals and elongated, spiky leaves that resemble those of a cactus. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. Cassuvium atrum is highly valued in botanical gardens for its unique appearance and ecological significance."
