    "intro": "Casearia tomentosa subsp. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly casearia, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a rough texture due to the dense pubescence."
