    "intro": "Cycnoches herrenhusanum, commonly known as the Herrenhausen cycnoches, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with intricate patterns, which are often adorned with yellow markings. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it can receive adequate light without direct sun exposure. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil of its habitat. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts of rare orchids."
