    "intro": "Clusia liesneri, commonly known as the Mexican glory bush, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptability to various soil types and tolerance to drought make it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates. The plant's ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun conditions adds to its ornamental value."
