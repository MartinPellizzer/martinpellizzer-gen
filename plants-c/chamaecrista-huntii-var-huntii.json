    "intro": "Chamaecrista huntii var. huntii, commonly known as the yellow burr legume, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces woody, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and dry woodlands. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a subject of ecological study."
