    "intro": "Cathetus, commonly known as the common catheter plant, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their nectar-rich structure."
