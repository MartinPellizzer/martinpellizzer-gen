    "intro": "Coussapoa chocoensis, commonly known as the Chocoan cupua\u00e7u, is a member of the Malvaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in Colombia and Ecuador. It is a climbing shrub that produces large, edible fruits similar to those of the cupua\u00e7u tree. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers. Its fruits are valued for their high content of lipids, proteins, and antioxidants, making it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
