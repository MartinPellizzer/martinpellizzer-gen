    "intro": "Cattleya labiata subvar. aurea, commonly known as the golden-lipped cattleya, is a hybrid orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, golden-yellow lip and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical forests. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its striking appearance."
