    "intro": "Cyperus commutatus, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often forming dense stands in shallow water or damp soil. Its slender, grass-like leaves are arranged in three rows, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Cyperus commutatus is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
