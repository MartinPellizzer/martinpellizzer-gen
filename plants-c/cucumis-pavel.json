    "intro": "Cucumis pavel, commonly known as the Pavlov cucumber, is a lesser-known species within the Cucurbitaceae family. It is characterized by its elongated, slender fruits that typically measure around 15 to 20 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are either male or female, typical of cucurbit species. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a slightly hairy surface, and the vines grow horizontally along the ground. The fruit has a mild, crisp texture and a slightly sweet flavor, making it suitable for fresh consumption or pickling."
