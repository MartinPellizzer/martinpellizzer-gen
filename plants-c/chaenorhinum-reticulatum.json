    "intro": "Chaenorhinum reticulatum, commonly known as the net-veined horned poppy, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, branched stems and showy, orange to red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
