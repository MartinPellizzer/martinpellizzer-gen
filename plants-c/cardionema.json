    "intro": "Cardionema, commonly known as the flame tree or bracken fern, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Proteaceae. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with feather-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder. Cardionema species are well adapted to dry conditions and can thrive in full sun, making them popular in ornamental gardening. The genus includes several species, such as Cardionema suberosum and Cardionema strictum, which are valued for their ornamental foliage and seasonal blooms."
