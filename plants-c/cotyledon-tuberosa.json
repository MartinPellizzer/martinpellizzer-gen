    "intro": "Cotyledon tuberosa, commonly known as the swollen cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red during the summer months. Its unique tuberous roots help it survive periods of drought. Cotyledon tuberosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant foliage and resilience."
