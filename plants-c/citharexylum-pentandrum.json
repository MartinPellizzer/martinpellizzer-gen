    "intro": "Citharexylum pentandrum, commonly known as the honeywood, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height. The plant features opposite, simple, and often elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and typically white or pale yellow, with a sweet, honey-like fragrance. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal."
