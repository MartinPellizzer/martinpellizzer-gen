    "intro": "Commiphora rotundifolia, commonly known as African myrrh, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its round, leathery leaves and produces a fragrant resin that has been used traditionally for medicinal and aromatic purposes. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in dry, sunny conditions. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with yellowish-green petals, and it is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. The resin exuded from its bark and stems is similar to myrrh and has been used in incense and traditional medicine."
