    "intro": "Cryptocarya darusensis, commonly known as the Daruseni cryptocarya, is a member of the Lauraceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and evergreen nature. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters, with dense, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in axillary or terminal inflorescences, and it produces small, spherical berries that are edible for some bird species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cryptocarya darusensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
