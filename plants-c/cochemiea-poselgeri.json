    "intro": "Cochemiea poselgeri, commonly known as the Poselger's candelabra cactus, is a compact, mound-forming plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a dense cluster of cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically blue-green in color, with a powdery coating known as farina. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on short, branching stems. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established. Cochemiea poselgeri is prized for its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
