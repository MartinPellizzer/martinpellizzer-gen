    "intro": "Cereus spinibarbis var. minor, commonly known as the small spiny cactus, is a succulent plant native to South America. It features a cylindrical stem with spiny areoles and produces white, funnel-shaped flowers at night. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts."
