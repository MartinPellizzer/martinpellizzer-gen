    "intro": "Chrysogonum dichotomum, commonly known as the forked leaf goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features slender, erect stems that often branch into two at the base, giving it its characteristic \"forked\" appearance. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in panicles. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Chrysogonum dichotomum thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
