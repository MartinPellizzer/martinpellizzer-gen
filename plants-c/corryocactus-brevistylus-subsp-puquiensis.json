    "intro": "Corryocactus brevistylus subsp. puquiensis, commonly known as the Puquienese short-styled cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the arid regions of Peru. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in white to pale green spines. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the dry season, which are highly fragrant and attract nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered a vulnerable species."
