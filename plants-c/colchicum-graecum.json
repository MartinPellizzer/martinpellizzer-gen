    "intro": "Colchicum graecum, commonly known as the Greek autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in the fall, typically from September to November. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous corm, which is its primary storage organ. Its flowers are spurred at the base, a characteristic feature of the Colchicaceae family. The plant is also noted for its toxic properties, containing colchicine, a compound used in medicine."
