    "intro": "Cakile lanceolata subsp. edentula, commonly known as the toothless bladderpod, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, orbicular leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods that split open to release seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its low water requirements, it is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
