    "intro": "Cistanche ambigua, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to species of Haloxylon and other shrubs. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers and has a distinctive, fleshy, branching stem. It is native to arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. Due to its parasitic nature and ecological role, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
