    "intro": "[WRONG START] Coudenia cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved coldenia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
