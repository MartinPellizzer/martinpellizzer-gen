    "intro": "Coniogramme affinis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed coniogramme, is a member of the Araliaceae family. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its finely divided, pinnate leaves that give it a fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbels, which are typically followed by spherical, red berries. Native to eastern North America, it thrives in moist, shady woodlands. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a native, low-maintenance plant."
