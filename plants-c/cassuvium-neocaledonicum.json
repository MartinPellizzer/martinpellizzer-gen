It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and trees. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
