    "intro": "Carrissoa, commonly known as the golden trumpet vine, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its showy, orange-yellow trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant is a vigorous climber with pinnately compound leaves and produces fruit that contains seeds enclosed in a fibrous, woody capsule. Carrissoa thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and striking appearance make it both a desirable and sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
