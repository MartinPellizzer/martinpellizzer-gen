    "intro": "Coelogyne beccarii var. micholitziana, commonly known as the Micholitz's orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with red or purple markings. It thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect light and well-draining potting media. Its unique floral structure and vibrant colors make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
