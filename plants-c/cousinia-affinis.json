    "intro": "Cousinia affinis, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. Cousinia affinis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
