    "intro": "Calopogon pulchellus f. latifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaf marsh orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and swamps, where it thrives in the shade of tall vegetation. Its broad leaves are a distinguishing feature of this form, setting it apart from the typical narrow-leaved variety. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
