    "intro": "Crotalaria fulvella, commonly known as the golden crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Crotalaria fulvella is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil fertility. However, some species within the genus are toxic, so caution is advised when handling or consuming any part of the plant."
