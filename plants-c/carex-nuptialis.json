    "intro": "Carex nuptialis, commonly known as the wedding sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and pond margins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and often have a bluish-green hue. Carex nuptialis is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
