    "intro": "Cnicus leucographus, commonly known as the white-stemmed sow thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are usually lobed and covered with fine hairs, while the flowers are small and yellow, forming a composite head. Cnicus leucographus is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
