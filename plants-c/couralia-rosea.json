    "intro": "Couralia rosea, commonly known as the rose coral or coral rose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, providing a striking contrast to the delicate flowers. Couralia rosea is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
