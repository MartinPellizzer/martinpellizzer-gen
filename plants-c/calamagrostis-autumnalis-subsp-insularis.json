    "intro": "Calamagrostis autumnalis subsp. insularis, commonly known as the coastal panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and silver-gray foliage that turns coppery in the fall. The plant produces panicles of small, fluffy flowers in late summer to early fall, which are often used in ornamental gardening. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for coastal and dry garden environments. Its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize sandy soils make it an ecologically valuable plant in coastal ecosystems."
