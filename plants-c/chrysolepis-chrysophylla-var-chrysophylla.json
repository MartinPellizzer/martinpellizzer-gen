    "intro": "Chrysolepis chrysophylla var. chrysophylla, commonly known as the goldenleaf mountain maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, broad leaves that are typically golden to yellow-green in color, which give the plant its common name. The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and often have serrated edges. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
