    "intro": "Cinchona trianae, commonly known as Tiana's quinine tree, is a species of the Rubiaceae family native to Colombia. It is characterized by its erect, branching shrub form with elliptical, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by oval, red berries containing seeds. It is valued for its historical role in the production of quinine, though it is less commonly used today. The species is also noted for its ornamental value and ecological significance in its native habitat."
