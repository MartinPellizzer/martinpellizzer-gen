    "intro": "Caenopteris japonica, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to East Asia. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating. Its rhizomes form dense mats, which help stabilize sediment and improve water quality. Caenopteris japonica is often used in ornamental water gardens due to its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
