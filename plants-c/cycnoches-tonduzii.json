    "intro": "Cycnoches tonduzii, commonly known as the Tonduz cycnoches, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, often colorful flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its leaves are usually broad and dark green, providing a lush backdrop to its vibrant blossoms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cycnoches tonduzii is considered a delicately endangered species."
