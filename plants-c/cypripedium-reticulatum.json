    "intro": "Cypripedium reticulatum, commonly known as the netted lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, fragrant, and spirally arranged flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, while its roots form a dense network that helps anchor it in the soil. Cypripedium reticulatum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
