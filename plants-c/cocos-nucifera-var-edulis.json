    "intro": "Cocos nucifera var. edulis, commonly known as the coconut palm, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces an oval, fibrous fruit known as a coconut, which contains both water and a white, fleshy layer called the copra. The coconut palm is widely cultivated for its fruit, oil, and other by-products. Its botanical features make it an essential plant in tropical agriculture and coastal ecosystems."
