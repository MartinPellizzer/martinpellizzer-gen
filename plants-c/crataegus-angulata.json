It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to ovate leaves, and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed sites.
