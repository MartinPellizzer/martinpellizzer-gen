    "intro": "Cyperus rufidulus, commonly known as the red-stem bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its triangular, often reddish stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds. Cyperus rufidulus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
