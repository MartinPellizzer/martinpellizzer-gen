    "intro": "Cactus brevimamma, commonly known as the short-rib cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on the upper parts of the stems. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in harsh desert conditions. Cactus brevimamma is well adapted to extreme temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient member of its ecosystem."
