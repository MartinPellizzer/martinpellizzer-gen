    "intro": "Ceroxylon sclerophyllum, commonly known as the Andean wax palm, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, primarily in Bolivia and Peru. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. Its leaves are covered in a thick layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This species is also notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, making it an important part of the Andean ecosystem."
