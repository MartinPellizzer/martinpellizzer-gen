    "intro": "Cassia mississipiensis, commonly known as the Florida cassia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves with oval-shaped leaflets and produces bright yellow, fragrant flowers in the spring. The plant is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and can grow up to 6 feet tall. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. The seeds are enclosed in elongated pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread."
