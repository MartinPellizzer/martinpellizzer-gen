    "intro": "Cynoglossum pustulatum, commonly known as the blistering bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has hairy, often glandular leaves that can produce a sticky substance, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Cynoglossum pustulatum is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role."
