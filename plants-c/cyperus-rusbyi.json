    "intro": "Cyperus rusbyi, commonly known as the Rusby flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. It has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often inconspicuous. Cyperus rusbyi is often used in ornamental gardening due to its ability to thrive in moist conditions and its attractive, feathery appearance."
