    "intro": "Claoxylon kingii, commonly known as the King's tree, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of northern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, smooth, light grey bark and its ability to form a buttressed root system. The tree produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a leathery texture with a prominent midrib. Claoxylon kingii is often found in lowland and hill forest areas, where it plays a role in maintaining ecological balance."
