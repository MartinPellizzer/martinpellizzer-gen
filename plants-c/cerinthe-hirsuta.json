    "intro": "Cerinthe hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy toadflax, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, with two lips that are characteristic of the Plantaginaceae family. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a rough texture. Cerinthe hirsuta is known for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and borders."
