It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, with a dense canopy and smooth, dark bark. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a glossy green surface, while the flowers are small and fragrant, typically white or pale yellow. Cupia produces small, round fruits that are edible and have a sweet, nutty flavor. It plays an important role in the ecosystem by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
