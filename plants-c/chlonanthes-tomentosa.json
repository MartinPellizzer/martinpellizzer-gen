    "intro": "Chlonanthes tomentosa, commonly known as the hairy bitterball, is a tropical climbing vine native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, spiny fruits that resemble small, green balls covered in a dense, white, woolly coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by the distinctive, fleshy, and often toxic fruits. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its overall hairy appearance. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in some cultures."
