    "intro": "Commelina erecta var. obliqua, commonly known as the zigzag commelina, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It features striking blue-violet flowers with white markings, typically borne on slender, branching stems. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. This variant is distinguished by its slightly zigzagging stem, which gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
