    "intro": "Chondrosum barbatum var. rothrockii, commonly known as the Rothrock's beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the Appalachian Mountains. It is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is of interest to botanists and gardeners due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
