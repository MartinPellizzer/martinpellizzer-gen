    "intro": "Crotalaria willdenowiana subsp. varmae, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and distinctive pod-like seed capsules. The plant is a legume, meaning it belongs to the Fabaceae family, and it has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through its root nodules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland habitats. The subspecies varmae is distinguished by its smaller, more compact growth form compared to other Crotalaria species."
