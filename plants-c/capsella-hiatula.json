The plant typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters, with small, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its seeds are enclosed in a siliqua, a type of dry fruit characteristic of the Brassicaceae family. Capsella hiatula is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
