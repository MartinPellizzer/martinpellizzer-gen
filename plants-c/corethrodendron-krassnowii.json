    "intro": "Corethrodendron krassnowii, commonly known as the Krassnow's corethrodendron, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, thriving in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. Its leaves are elliptical with a glossy surface, and the flowers are usually white or pale yellow, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
