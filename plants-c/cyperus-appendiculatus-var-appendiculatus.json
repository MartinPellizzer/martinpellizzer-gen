    "intro": "Cyperus appendiculatus var. appendiculatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its slender, grass-like leaves are arranged in three rows, and it produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in aquatic conditions."
