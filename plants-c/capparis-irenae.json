    "intro": "Capparis irenae, commonly known as the Irena's caper, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Capparaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are often clustered in umbels, and its fruits are small, round capsules containing several seeds. It thrives in rocky, coastal environments and is adapted to the dry, sunny conditions of its native habitat. Capparis irenae is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
