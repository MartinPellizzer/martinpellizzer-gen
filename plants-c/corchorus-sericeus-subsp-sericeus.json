    "intro": "Corchorus sericeus subsp. sericeus, commonly known as silky touch-hair, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its finely hairy, silver-green foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically borne on slender stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is occasionally cultivated for both aesthetic and practical purposes."
