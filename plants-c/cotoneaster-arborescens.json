    "intro": "Cotoneaster arborescens, commonly known as the evergreen cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It features showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during late spring to early summer. The plant produces bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its adaptability makes it suitable for a variety of garden settings, though it can become invasive in some regions. Cotoneaster arborescens typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 feet, with dense, glossy foliage that provides year-round interest."
