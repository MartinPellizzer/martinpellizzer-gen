    "intro": "Corymbia haematoxylon, commonly known as the red ironwood, is a species of tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, dark red to black timber, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, edible fruits. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture and a strong, aromatic scent. The tree is well adapted to arid environments and can thrive in poor soil conditions."
