    "intro": "Cuscuta gigantea var. gigantea, commonly known as giant dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host to extract water and nutrients. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on crops such as corn and soybeans. Its rapid growth and ability to spread quickly make it a significant agricultural pest. The seeds of giant dodder can remain viable in the soil for many years, making it difficult to control."
