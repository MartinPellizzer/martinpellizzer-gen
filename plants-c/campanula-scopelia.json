    "intro": "Campanula scopelia, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Campanula scopelia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine setting."
