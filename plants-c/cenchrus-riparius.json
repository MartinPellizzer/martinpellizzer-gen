    "intro": "Cenchrus riparius, commonly known as the rivergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Cenchrus riparius is valued for its erosion control capabilities and is sometimes used in restoration projects."
