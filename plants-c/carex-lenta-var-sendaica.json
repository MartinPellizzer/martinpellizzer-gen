    "intro": "Carex lenta var. sendaica, commonly known as the Sendaica sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spikes of small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. Carex lenta var. sendaica is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and water filtration."
