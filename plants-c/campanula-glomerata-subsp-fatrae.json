It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are typically lanceolate and covered in a fine pubescence, while its stems are hairy and often reddish in color. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
