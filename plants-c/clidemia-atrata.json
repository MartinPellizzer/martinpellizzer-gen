    "intro": "Clidemia atrata, commonly known as velvetleaf or blackleaf strobilanthes, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale purple, with showy bracts that attract pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Clidemia atrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
