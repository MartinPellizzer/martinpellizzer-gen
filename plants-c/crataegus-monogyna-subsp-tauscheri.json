    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna subsp. tauscheri, commonly known as the Tauscher's hawthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and woodland edges. The plant features simple, ovate leaves with serrated margins and produces small, white to pinkish flowers in spring. Its fruits are red, fleshy berries that ripen in late summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf shape and geographic distribution compared to the typical form of Crataegus monogyna."
