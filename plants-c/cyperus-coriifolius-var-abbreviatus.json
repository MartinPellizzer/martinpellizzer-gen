    "intro": "Cyperus coriifolius var. abbreviatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often arranged in three rows. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically at the base of the stems, and is often found in wet or marshy habitats. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is adapted to moist environments. This variety is distinguished from the typical Cyperus coriifolius by its shorter, more compact leaves."
