    "intro": "Cousinia saloukensis, commonly known as the Saloukensis globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular growth habit. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It has hairy, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Cousinia saloukensis is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats."
