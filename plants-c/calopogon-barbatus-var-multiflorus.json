    "intro": "Calopogon barbatus var. multiflorus, commonly known as the swamp pink, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands in the southeastern United States. It features striking, showy inflorescences composed of multiple pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, club-shaped seed pods that mature in the fall. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
