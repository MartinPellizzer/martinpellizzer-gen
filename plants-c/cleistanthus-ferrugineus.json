    "intro": "Cleistanthus ferrugineus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
