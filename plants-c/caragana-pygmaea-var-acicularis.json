It features small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by elongated, barbed pods. It is well adapted to harsh, cold climates and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Its hardy nature makes it a valuable plant for stabilizing soil in extreme conditions."
