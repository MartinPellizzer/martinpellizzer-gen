    "intro": "Capparis erythrodasys, commonly known as the red-flowered caper, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of bright red, urn-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round, green fruits that mature into a red, fleshy berry. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating. Capparis erythrodasys is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
