    "intro": "Coleocephalocereus fluminensis var. braamhaarii, commonly known as the Braamhals Cereus, is a rare and striking cactus native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized collections."
