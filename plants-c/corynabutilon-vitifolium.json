    "intro": "Corynabutilon vitifolium, commonly known as the grape-leaved corynabutilon, is a rare and unusual plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that resemble grape leaves in shape and texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in the spring. Its growth habit is generally shrub-like, with woody stems and a compact form. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and plant enthusiasts alike."
