It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid climates. It plays a role in preventing soil erosion due to its extensive root system. The flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, contributing to its ecological significance in supporting pollinators."
