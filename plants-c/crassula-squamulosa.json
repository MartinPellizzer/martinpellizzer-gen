It is characterized by its dense, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Its compact growth habit and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
