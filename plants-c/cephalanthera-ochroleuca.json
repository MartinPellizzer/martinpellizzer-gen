    "intro": "Cephalanthera ochroleuca, commonly known as the yellow helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves and its striking, showy flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a reddish-brown throat. The plant produces a single, upright spike of flowers, each with three sepals and three petals, with the lip petal being larger and more prominent. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in shaded, moist woodlands. The yellow helleborine is notable for its lack of a visible scent and its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
