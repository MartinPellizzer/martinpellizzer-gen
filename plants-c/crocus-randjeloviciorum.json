    "intro": "Crocus randjeloviciorum, commonly known as the Serbian crocus, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe. It is a perennial bulbous plant that produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow to orange during late winter or early spring. The plant's botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and a compact, bulbous stem that supports its single, cup-shaped bloom. It thrives in well-drained soils and cooler climates, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
