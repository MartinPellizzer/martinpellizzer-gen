    "intro": "Caulophyllum giganteum, commonly known as the giant death camaria, is a striking perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces toxic berries that are highly poisonous to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded areas with rich, organic soil. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
