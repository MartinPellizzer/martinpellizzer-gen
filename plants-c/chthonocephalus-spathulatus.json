    "intro": "Chthonocephalus spathulatus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale, translucent leaves and delicate, elongated flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
