    "intro": "Cyperus betschuanus, commonly known as the African flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
