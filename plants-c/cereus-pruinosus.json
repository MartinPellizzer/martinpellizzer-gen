    "intro": "Cereus pruinosus, commonly known as the velvet cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems covered in a dense, velvety white coating of fine hairs. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom at night. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
