It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland areas. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture, while its fruits are capsule-like and contain several seeds. Colubrina intorta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
