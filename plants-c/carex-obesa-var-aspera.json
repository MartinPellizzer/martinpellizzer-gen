    "intro": "Carex obesa var. aspera, commonly known as the rough bulblet sedge, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It is characterized by its clump-forming growth habit and produces dense, grass-like foliage that is often slightly rough to the touch. The plant features small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in areas with standing water or saturated ground. Due to its adaptability, it is a common species in wetland restoration projects and natural wetlands."
