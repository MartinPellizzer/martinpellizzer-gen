    "intro": "Cyclosorus articulatus, commonly known as the segmented liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Ptilidiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lobed thallus that often forms dense mats on moist, shaded soil or rock surfaces. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with distinct, segmented structures that give it its common name. It thrives in humid environments, typically found in temperate regions with high moisture levels. Cyclosorus articulatus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small invertebrates."
