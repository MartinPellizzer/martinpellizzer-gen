    "intro": "Cardamine raphanifolia subsp. merinoi, commonly known as the Merino watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in cool, clear streams and pools. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread along the margins of water bodies. This species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
