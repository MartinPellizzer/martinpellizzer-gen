    "intro": "Cyclamen durostoricum, commonly known as the rock cyclamen, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers partial shade to full sun, depending on the climate. Its tuberous roots allow it to survive harsh winter conditions, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. Cyclamen durostoricum is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
