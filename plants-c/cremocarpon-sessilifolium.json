    "intro": "Cremocarpon sessilifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed buttercup, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Ranunculaceae. It is characterized by its basal leaves that are sessile, meaning they attach directly to the stem without a stalk. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five sepals and numerous stamens, typical of the buttercup genus. It thrives in moist, often calcareous soils and is found in various regions across Europe and Asia. Cremocarpon sessilifolium is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas."
