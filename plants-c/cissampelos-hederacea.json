    "intro": "Cissampelos hederacea, commonly known as the creeping woodbine, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are woody and can trail along the ground or climb supports. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds."
