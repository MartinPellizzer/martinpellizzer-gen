    "intro": "Comarostaphylis arbutoides subsp. arbutoides, commonly known as the dwarf strawberry tree, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and silvery-white underneath. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial shade to full sun. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in coastal and limestone-rich environments."
