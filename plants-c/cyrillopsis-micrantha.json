    "intro": "Cyrillopsis micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cyrillopsis micrantha is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
