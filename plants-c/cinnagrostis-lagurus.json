    "intro": "Cinnagrostis lagurus, commonly known as the silverleaf goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in the late summer and early fall. The plant features narrow, silver- or gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in dry, disturbed soils. Cinnagrostis lagurus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
