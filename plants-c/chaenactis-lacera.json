    "intro": "Chaenactis lacera, commonly known as the Sierra cliff's lettuce, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and daisy-like appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are often hairy and serrated, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Chaenactis lacera produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
