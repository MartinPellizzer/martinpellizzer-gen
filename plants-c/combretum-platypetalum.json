    "intro": "Combretum platypetalum, commonly known as the broad-petaled combretum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with showy, petal-like bracts that give it its common name. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in savannas and along riverbanks."
