    "intro": "Campanula scheuchzeri subsp. stenocodon, commonly known as the narrow-corned bellflower, is a rare and alpine plant native to the European Alps. It is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, typically blooming in late summer. The plant grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in mountain meadows and scree slopes. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
