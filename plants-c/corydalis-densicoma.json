    "intro": "Corydalis densicoma, commonly known as the dense-hairy corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant features slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Corydalis densicoma is a perennial herb that thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in forested areas at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural gardens, though it remains relatively rare in the wild."
