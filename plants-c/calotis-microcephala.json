    "intro": "Calotis microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed burr grass, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its small, spiny seed heads that form dense clusters. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Calotis microcephala is an important component of the local flora, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
