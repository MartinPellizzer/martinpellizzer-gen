    "intro": "Cenchrus pauciflorus var. muricatus, commonly known as the roughhair grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and stiff, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and ornamental purposes."
