    "intro": "Carludovica caput-medusae, commonly known as the \"Medusa head\" plant, is a striking bromeliad native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence topped with a cluster of bright red, bell-shaped flowers. The plant has sword-shaped, evergreen leaves that form a rosette, creating a unique and dramatic appearance. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Despite its ornamental value, it is relatively rare in cultivation due to its specific care requirements."
