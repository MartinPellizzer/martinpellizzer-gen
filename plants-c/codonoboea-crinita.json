    "intro": "Codonoboea crinita, commonly known as the hairy codonopsis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has hairy stems and leaves, which contribute to its common name. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
