    "intro": "Cassia sericea, commonly known as silky cassia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in a fine, silky white down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, followed by elongated, flat pods that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Cassia sericea is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
