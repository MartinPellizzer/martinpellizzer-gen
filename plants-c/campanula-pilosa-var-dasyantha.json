    "intro": "Campanula pilosa var. dasyantha, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it tolerates cool temperatures and full sun. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with similar growing conditions."
