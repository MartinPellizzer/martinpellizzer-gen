    "intro": "Cheilanthes ramentacea, commonly known as the rock spurge or desert shield fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a perennial, evergreen fern that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with dense, pale green to grayish foliage. Its fronds are leathery and often covered in a fine layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss. It is well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in harsh, sun-exposed conditions."
