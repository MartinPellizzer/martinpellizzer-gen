    "intro": "Coelococcus warburgii, commonly known as the Warburg's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. This plant is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. The plant's roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
