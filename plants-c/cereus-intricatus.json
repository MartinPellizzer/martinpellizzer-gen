    "intro": "Cereus intricatus, commonly known as the star cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Cereus intricatus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and nocturnal flowering habit."
