    "intro": "Cyperus foliaceus, commonly known as flatleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, flat leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along water bodies. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in a panicle. Cyperus foliaceus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
