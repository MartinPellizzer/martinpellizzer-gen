    "intro": "Cortaderia echinata, commonly known as the spiny feather reed, is a striking ornamental grass native to South America. It features tall, slender stalks covered in narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces fluffy, feathery plumes that add visual interest, particularly in the fall and winter. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil. Due to its architectural form and seasonal display, it is popular in gardens and landscapes for its aesthetic and structural value."
