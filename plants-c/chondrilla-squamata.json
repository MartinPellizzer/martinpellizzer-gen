    "intro": "Chondrilla squamata, commonly known as the sand mat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense clusters of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the base of the stems. It has adapted to survive in dry environments through its succulent leaves and deep root system. Chondrilla squamata is often found in sandy soils and is used in some traditional medicinal practices."
