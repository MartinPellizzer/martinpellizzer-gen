    "intro": "Cercis georgiana, commonly known as the Southern catalpa, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and its showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces long, bean-like pods that contain flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it adaptable to various garden environments. Cercis georgiana is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to provide seasonal interest."
