    "intro": "Cyathea dentata, commonly known as the serrated tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound fronds. The fronds are typically dark green and have serrated edges, giving the plant its common name. Cyathea dentata grows in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and contributing to forest biodiversity."
