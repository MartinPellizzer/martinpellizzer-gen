    "intro": "Chaenorhinum longepedunculatum, commonly known as the long pedunculate horned poppy, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers with prominent yellow markings, which resemble the shape of a horn. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and features slender, branched stems covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, while the flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is also found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
