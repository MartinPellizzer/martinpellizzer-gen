    "intro": "Cestrum parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved jessamine, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by small, orange-red berries that contain the plant's seeds. Cestrum parvifolium is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to a variety of soil types and light conditions."
