It is characterized by its pale yellow to white flowers that resemble snowflakes, giving it its common name. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and thrives in alpine and subalpine environments. Its foliage consists of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. This frost-resistant plant is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates."
