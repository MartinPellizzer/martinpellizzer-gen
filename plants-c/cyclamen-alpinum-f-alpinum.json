    "intro": "Cyclamen alpinum f. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine cyclamen, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a tuberous root system that stores nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in cold, rocky environments. The plant produces striking, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and delicate, spurred flowers in shades of pink, white, and red. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires cool, moist conditions during its growing season. Cyclamen alpinum f. alpinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
