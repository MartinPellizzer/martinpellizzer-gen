    "intro": "Calamagrostis epigejos var. riparia, commonly known as river reed, is a perennial grass native to wetland and riparian habitats. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often reddish-brown in color. The plant produces panicles of spikelets that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to wetland landscapes. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found along riverbanks and pond edges. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective natural stabilizer for soil in aquatic environments."
