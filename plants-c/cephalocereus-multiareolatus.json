    "intro": "Cephalocereus multiareolatus, commonly known as the Pencil Cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are segmented and covered in areoles, which are small, raised structures from which spines and flowers emerge. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its stems are succulent, allowing it to store water efficiently in arid environments. The plant is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and indoor gardening."
