    "intro": "Calostemma album, commonly known as the white bellflower, is a striking member of the Asparagaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, round berries that turn red as they mature. Calostemma album is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained conditions."
