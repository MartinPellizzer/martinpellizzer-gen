It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its long, trailing stems that often hang from the edges of rock faces. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by blue or purple berries, which are edible for birds. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a slight sheen, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
