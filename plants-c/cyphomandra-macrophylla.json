    "intro": "Cyphomandra macrophylla, commonly known as the giant purple potato, is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes and potatoes. It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, violet flowers. The plant produces tubers that are often larger than those of the common potato, though they are not typically cultivated for food. Botanically, it is notable for its robust growth habit and its role in the evolution of cultivated potatoes."
