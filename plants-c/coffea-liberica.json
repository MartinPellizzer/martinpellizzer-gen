    "intro": "Coffea liberica, commonly known as the Liberian coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to western and central Africa, particularly found in countries like Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea. The plant produces large, oval-shaped leaves and bears red, fleshy berries containing the seeds used for coffee. It is known for its distinct flavor profile, often described as having a smoky or woody note. While less commonly cultivated than Coffea arabica or Coffea canephora, it remains an important species in the coffee industry."
