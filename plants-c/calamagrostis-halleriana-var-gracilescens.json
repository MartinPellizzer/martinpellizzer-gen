    "intro": "Calamagrostis halleriana var. gracilescens, commonly known as the slender marsh reed, is a perennial grass native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or gray on the underside. Its inflorescence consists of dense, cylindrical clusters of spikelets that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting wetland biodiversity."
