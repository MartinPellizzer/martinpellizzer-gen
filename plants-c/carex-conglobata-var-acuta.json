    "intro": "Carex conglobata var. acuta, commonly known as the acute sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its dense growth habit makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and habitat creation for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
