It is a terrestrial orchid with a short, stocky rhizome and a single, fleshy, dark green leaf. The plant produces a raceme of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with prominent sepals and petals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or humus-rich soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
