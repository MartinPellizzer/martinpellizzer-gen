    "intro": "Combretum oliviforme, commonly known as the oliveleaf bush, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its lanceolate,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) leaves that are often arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release small, winged seeds when mature. Combretum oliviforme is often found in moist woodland and forest margins, and it plays a role in local ecosystems as a habitat and food source."
