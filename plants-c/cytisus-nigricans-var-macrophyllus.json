    "intro": "Cytisus nigricans var. macrophyllus, commonly known as the large-leaved broom, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are larger than those of the typical Cytisus nigricans. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice in horticulture."
