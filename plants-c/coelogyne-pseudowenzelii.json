    "intro": "Coelogyne pseudowenzelii, commonly known as the Wenzel's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescence that bears clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients, which helps it survive in its tropical environment. Coelogyne pseudowenzelii is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively uncommon occurrence in cultivation."
