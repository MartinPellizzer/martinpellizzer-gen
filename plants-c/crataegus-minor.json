    "intro": "Crataegus minor, commonly known as the dwarf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white to pinkish flowers in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but generally unpalatable to humans. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Crataegus minor is often used in hedgerows and as an ornamental plant due to its spring blossoms and autumn foliage."
