    "intro": "Calamagrostis rosea, commonly known as the pink moor grass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its striking pink to purple plumes that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is fine and grass-like, with a soft, feathery texture that adds ornamental value to gardens. Calamagrostis rosea is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and its ability to attract pollinators."
