    "intro": "Calomeria infausta, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features basal leaves that are oblanceolate and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Calomeria infausta is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy species suited to xeriscaping."
