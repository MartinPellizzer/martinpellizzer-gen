    "intro": "Carex lagopina f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a dense, cylindrical cluster at the base. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like structure with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is characterized by its narrow foliage and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
