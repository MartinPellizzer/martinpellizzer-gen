    "intro": "Cardamine microphylla var. blaisdellii, commonly known as Blaisdell's lesser cowslip, is a rare and delicate herbaceous plant native to the Appalachian Mountains. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often yellow or white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky woods and stream banks. Its small, pinnately divided leaves are a distinguishing feature, and it produces clusters of tiny, spurred flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
