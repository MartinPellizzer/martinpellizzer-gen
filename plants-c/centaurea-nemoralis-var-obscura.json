    "intro": "Centaurea nemoralis var. obscura, commonly known as the darkwood centaury, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and grasslands. The plant features upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are bright red or purple, forming dense, cylindrical clusters at the ends of the stems. This variety is distinguished by its darker, more subdued flower color compared to the typical form of Centaurea nemoralis."
