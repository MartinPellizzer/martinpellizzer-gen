    "intro": "Cylindrolobus carunculosus, commonly known as the hairy globular thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spherical, spiny head of yellow flowers surrounded by dense, woolly bracts. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils. Its leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
