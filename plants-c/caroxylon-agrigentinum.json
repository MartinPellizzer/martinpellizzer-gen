    "intro": "Caroxylon agrigentinum, commonly known as the Agrigentine caroxylon, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Its botanical structure suggests adaptations to arid environments, with thick cuticles and reduced leaf surface area. Due to its historical significance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research."
