    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe ramiro-medinae, commonly known as the Medina's crocodile fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that resemble the scales of a crocodile, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture from the air. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sporangia, are clustered in dense, round clusters on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
