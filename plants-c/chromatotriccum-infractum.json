It has filamentous, branching stems that often float on the water surface or root in shallow water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown in color. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. Chromatotriccum infractum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
