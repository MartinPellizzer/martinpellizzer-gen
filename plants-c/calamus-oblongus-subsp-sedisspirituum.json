    "intro": "Calamus oblongus subsp. sedisspirituum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved calamus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and narrow, linear leaves that are often arranged in a dense, grass-like manner. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a spadix, typical of the Araceae family, which are enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens and wetland restoration projects."
