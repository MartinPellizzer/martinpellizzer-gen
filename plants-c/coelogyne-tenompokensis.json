    "intro": "Coelogyne tenompokensis, commonly known as the Tengompen orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Sumatra, Indonesia. It is a sympodial orchid with a short, stocky rhizome and produces a single, upright inflorescence bearing several fragrant, showy flowers. The flowers are typically white or pale pink with a distinctive yellow lip, and they bloom during the dry season. This species is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in shaded, humid forest environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Coelogyne tenompokensis is considered a threatened species."
