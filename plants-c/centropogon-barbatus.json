    "intro": "Centropogon barbatus, commonly known as the hairy grassvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant features slender, erect stems with hairy leaves that are often arranged in a basal rosette. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in spikes and bloom during the summer months. Centropogon barbatus is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
