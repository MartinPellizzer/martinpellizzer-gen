    "intro": "Costera cyclophylla, commonly known as the spiral leaf cycad, is a unique cycad species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiral-arranged leaves that give it a striking appearance. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, typical of cycads. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine and horticulture. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
