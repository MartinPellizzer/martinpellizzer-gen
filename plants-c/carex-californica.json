    "intro": "Carex californica, commonly known as the California sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to western North America. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, three-lobed flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or streamside habitats. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Carex californica is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
