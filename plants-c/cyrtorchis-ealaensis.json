    "intro": "Cyrtorchis ealaensis, commonly known as the Ealaensis Rock Orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive floral morphology, with showy, often fragrant blossoms. The plant typically thrives in rocky or limestone habitats, showcasing its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the substrate, a key feature of its survival strategy. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern."
