    "intro": "Cyperus bracteosus, commonly known as the broadleaf flatsedge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically found in dense clusters near the base of the plant. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it can tolerate fluctuating water levels. Cyperus bracteosus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
