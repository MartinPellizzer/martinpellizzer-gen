It features slender, arching blades that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with a soft, feathery appearance. The plant produces fluffy, silver-gray seed heads in late summer, which are visually striking and attract wildlife. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for wetland restoration and landscape design."
