    "intro": "Centaurea resupinata subsp. simulans, commonly known as the creeping cornflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features slender, sprawling stems that often lie close to the ground, with small, bright blue to purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs, and the plant produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. This subspecies is closely related to other members of the Centaurea genus and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
