    "intro": "Conyza divaricata, commonly known as the slenderleaf fleabane, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant features opposite, linear to lanceolate leaves and produces small, yellow to white composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Conyza divaricata is often found in regions with warm climates and is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native areas."
