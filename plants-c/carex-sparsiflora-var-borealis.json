    "intro": "Carex sparsiflora var. borealis, commonly known as the northern sparse-flower sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as bogs, fens, and marshes, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces slender, spike-like clusters of pale green to brownish flowers. The plant plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
