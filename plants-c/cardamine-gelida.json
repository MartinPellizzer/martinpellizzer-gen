    "intro": "Cardamine gelida, commonly known as the frostweed or winter water-cress, is a small, herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as along streams, in woodlands, and in damp meadows. The plant has delicate, trifoliate leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers in early spring. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. Cardamine gelida is an important species for pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
