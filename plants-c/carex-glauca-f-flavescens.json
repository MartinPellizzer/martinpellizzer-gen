    "intro": "Carex glauca f. flavescens, commonly known as the golden sedge, is a variant of the common sedge species Carex glauca. It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow foliage, which sets it apart from the typical blue-green color of the parent species. The plant is a perennial herbaceous species belonging to the Cyperaceae family, commonly found in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and streambanks. Its inflorescence consists of a spiky cluster of small, three-lobed flowers, typical of the sedge family. The golden sedge is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wetland environments."
