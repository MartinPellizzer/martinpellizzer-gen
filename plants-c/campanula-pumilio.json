    "intro": "Campanula pumilio, commonly known as the snow bell or dwarf bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically reaches a height of only a few inches, making it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often hairy as well. Campanula pumilio thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, sandy or rocky soils."
