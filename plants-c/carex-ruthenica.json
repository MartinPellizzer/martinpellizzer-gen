It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Carex ruthenica thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
