It is characterized by its slender, leathery leaves that are often arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, spiny seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and ability to attract pollinators."
