    "intro": "Conocephalus amethystinus, commonly known as the amethystine conocephalus, is a species of orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet and green coloration, which helps it blend into its natural habitat. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a few leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicately endangered species."
