    "intro": "Codonanthopsis luteola, commonly known as the yellow moss orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, moss-like growth habit and produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the late summer months. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky outcrops and forest floors. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to store water in arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
