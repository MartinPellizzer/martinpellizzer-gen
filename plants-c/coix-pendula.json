    "intro": "Coix pendula, commonly known as the hanging coix, is a perennial grass native to East Asia. It is characterized by its drooping, cylindrical inflorescence that resembles a curtain, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are elongated and narrow, with a slightly hairy texture. Coix pendula is often cultivated for its edible seeds, which are used in traditional Chinese medicine and cuisine."
