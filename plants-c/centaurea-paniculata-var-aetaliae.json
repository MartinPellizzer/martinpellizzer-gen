    "intro": "Centaurea paniculata var. aetaliae, commonly known as the Aetolian panicled centaury, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branching stems that often grow up to 60 cm in height. The plant produces vibrant blue to purple flowers in paniculate inflorescences, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
