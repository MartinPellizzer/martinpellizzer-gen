It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves that are glossy on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by dark blue, spherical berries. It is often cultivated for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes grown in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
