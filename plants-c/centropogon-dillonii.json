    "intro": "Centropogon dillonii, commonly known as the Dillon's lily, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in wet forest habitats, often near streams or in shaded areas with high humidity. Its leaves are long and strap-like, and it produces a single, striking flower per stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Centropogon dillonii is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
