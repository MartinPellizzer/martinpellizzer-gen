    "intro": "Campanula bertolae subsp. xylorrhiza, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of bell-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its hairy leaves and a preference for well-drained, rocky soils. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
