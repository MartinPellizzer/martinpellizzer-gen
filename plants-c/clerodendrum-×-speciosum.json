    "intro": "Clerodendrum \u00d7 speciosum, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a flowering shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, papery bracts that resemble small lanterns, which are often brightly colored in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in umbels, surrounded by the showy bracts. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the plant can grow up to several meters in height under optimal conditions."
