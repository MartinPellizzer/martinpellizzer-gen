    "intro": "Cayaponia kathematophora, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its pale, translucent leaves and delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant lacks true leaves and roots, relying instead on its specialized aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Cayaponia kathematophora is considered a conservation concern."
