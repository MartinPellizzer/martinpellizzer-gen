    "intro": "Centrosema rigidulum, commonly known as rigidstem cowpea, is a perennial legume native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by pod fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for use in erosion control and as a forage crop. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia makes it beneficial for soil fertility."
