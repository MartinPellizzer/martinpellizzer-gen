    "intro": "Cassia glanduligera, commonly known as the glandular cassia, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with glandular structures on the leaflets, which secrete a sticky substance. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in racemes, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Cassia glanduligera is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and pharmacological studies."
