It is a herbaceous annual that produces small, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant has hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields."
