    "intro": "Cereus gladiger, commonly known as the giant night bloomer, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its stems are covered in dense, white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Cereus gladiger is often cultivated for its striking appearance and unique nocturnal flowering habit."
