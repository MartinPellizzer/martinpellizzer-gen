    "intro": "Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus var. molestus, commonly known as the sticky golden sage, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs covering its stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance and help deter herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical heads. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native habitat and a subject of study in ecological and botanical research."
