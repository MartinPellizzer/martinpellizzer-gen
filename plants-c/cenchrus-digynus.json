    "intro": "Cenchrus digynus, commonly known as the two-row grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Cenchrus digynus is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
