    "intro": "Cerastium latifolium var. edmondstonii, commonly known as Edmondston's mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features basal leaves that are broad and hairy, with a rosette growth habit that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in rocky soils and alpine habitats, often forming dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
