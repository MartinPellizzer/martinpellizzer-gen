It is native to the Hawaiian Islands and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated petioles that support its broad, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale green, arranged in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
