    "intro": "Cyclosorus tottoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water clover, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, ribbon-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, often floating on the water surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Cyclosorus tottoides plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
