    "intro": "Canarium urdanetense, commonly known as the Urdanet nut tree, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its evergreen canopy and aromatic leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, spiny capsules containing edible seeds. These seeds are rich in oils and have been traditionally used for culinary and medicinal purposes. Due to habitat loss, Canarium urdanetense is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
