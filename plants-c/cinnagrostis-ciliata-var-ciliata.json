    "intro": "Cinnagrostis ciliata var. ciliata, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early summer. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and is often found in shallow water or damp terrestrial habitats. Its botanical significance lies in its ecological role as a food source for various invertebrates and its use in wetland restoration projects."
