    "intro": "Chelonopsis abbreviata, commonly known as the short-stemmed marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland and marsh habitats in eastern Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with slender, often decumbent stems that bear several lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which are typically short-lived but attract specific pollinators. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the waterlogged soils of its habitat. Chelonopsis abbreviata is a relatively rare species, with limited distribution and requiring specific environmental conditions for successful growth."
