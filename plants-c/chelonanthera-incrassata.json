    "intro": "Chelonanthera incrassata, commonly known as the thick-horned orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its robust, leathery leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in rich, well-drained soil. Its unique floral structure includes a prominent, spurred labellum that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
