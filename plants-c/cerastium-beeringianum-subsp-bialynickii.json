    "intro": "Cerastium beeringianum subsp. bialynickii, commonly known as the Beringian mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its habitat."
