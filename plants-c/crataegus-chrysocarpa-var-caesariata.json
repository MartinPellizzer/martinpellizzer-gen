    "intro": "Crataegus chrysocarpa var. caesariata, commonly known as the golden-fruited hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, orange to red berries that ripen in the fall, which are edible but typically not consumed by humans. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges, and it has thorny branches typical of the Crataegus genus. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
