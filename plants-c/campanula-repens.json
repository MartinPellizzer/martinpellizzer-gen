    "intro": "Campanula repens, commonly known as the running bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapting to various soil conditions. Campanula repens thrives in moist, well-drained environments and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
