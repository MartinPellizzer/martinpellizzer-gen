    "intro": "Calanthe tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled calanthe, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. Calanthe tetragona prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
