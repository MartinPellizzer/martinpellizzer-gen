    "intro": "Calamagrostis tarmensis, commonly known as the Tarmian reed, is a perennial grass native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant features tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, fluffy flowers that appear in late summer. Calamagrostis tarmensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
