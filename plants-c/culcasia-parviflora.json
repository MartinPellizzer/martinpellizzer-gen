    "intro": "Culcasia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered arrowhead, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and have a smooth texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often floating on the water's surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often used in ornamental ponds. Culcasia parviflora is also valued for its ability to improve water quality by absorbing nutrients."
