    "intro": "Cerastium alpinum subsp. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. The leaves are typically broad and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in harsh mountain environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and scree slopes. This subspecies is notable for its resilience to cold temperatures and its role in stabilizing alpine ecosystems."
