    "intro": "Cardamine polyphylla f. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved watercress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically narrower and more elongated compared to the typical form of Cardamine polyphylla. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typical of the Brassicaceae family. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine and as a culinary herb due to their peppery flavor."
