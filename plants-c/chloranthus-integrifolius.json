    "intro": "Chloranthus integrifolius, commonly known as the smooth-leaved chloranthus, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Chloranthaceae. It is characterized by its simple, entire leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, often with a faintly aromatic scent. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
