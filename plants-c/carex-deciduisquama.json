    "intro": "Carex deciduisquama, commonly known as the deciduous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Carex deciduisquama plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
