    "intro": "Cyperus filiformis var. havanensis, commonly known as the Havanan flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or marshy areas, exhibiting a dense, grass-like appearance with slender, thread-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in wetlands, rice fields, and along waterways. Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
