    "intro": "Cistanche ridgewayana, commonly known as the Chinese parasitic sage, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid regions of China. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on host plants for water and nutrients while conducting photosynthesis. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers and has a branched, fleshy stem that often grows in a creeping manner. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Due to its medicinal properties, it is also valued in traditional Chinese medicine."
