    "intro": "Cymbopogon rufus, commonly known as red grass or red panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, reddish-brown stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that often have a slightly hairy texture. This plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and woodland edges. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often wind-pollinated. Cymbopogon rufus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and adaptability to various soil conditions."
