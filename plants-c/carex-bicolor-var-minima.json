    "intro": "Carex bicolor var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf white sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features dense, grass-like foliage with a distinct color variation, where the lower leaves are often a lighter green compared to the darker upper leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are typically clustered in spikes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in wetland restoration projects. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking native, hardy plants."
