    "intro": "Cycas caffra, commonly known as the African cycad, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones ovoid, containing the seeds. Cycas caffra thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it adaptable to arid environments. It is also noted for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for several decades."
