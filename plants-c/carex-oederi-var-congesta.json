    "intro": "Carex oederi var. congesta, commonly known as the clustered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. The plant features grass-like leaves that are narrow and strap-shaped, with a dense growth habit. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, three-ranked flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. This variety is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
