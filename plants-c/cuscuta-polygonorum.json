    "intro": "Cuscuta polygonorum, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow flowers and has slender, twining stems that attach to host plants through haustoria, specialized structures that penetrate the host's tissues. The plant is often found parasitizing members of the Polygonaceae family, such as buckwheat and sorrel. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, with seeds dispersed by wind or animals. Cuscuta polygonorum is an example of a holoparasite, meaning it derives all its nutrients from its host."
