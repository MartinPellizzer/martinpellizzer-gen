It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique volcanic soils of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
