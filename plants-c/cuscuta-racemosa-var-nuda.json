    "intro": "Cuscuta racemosa var. nuda, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on agricultural crops and weeds. Its life cycle involves germinating on host seeds and forming haustoria to extract water and nutrients. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and is considered a weed in many regions."
