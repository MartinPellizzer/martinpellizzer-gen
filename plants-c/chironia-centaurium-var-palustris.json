    "intro": "Chironia centaurium var. palustris, commonly known as marsh centaury, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its small, bright yellow flowers are clustered in loose spikes, blooming from late spring to early summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in wetland ecosystems."
