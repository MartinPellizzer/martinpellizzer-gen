    "intro": "Callitriche sessilis var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, often in muddy or sandy substrates. The plant has tiny, star-shaped leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in diameter, and it produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in the summer. It is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. Due to its delicate appearance and habitat preferences, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of water quality."
