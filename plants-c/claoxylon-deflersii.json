It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits. It is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of incense. Claoxylon deflersii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry savanna and woodland habitats."
