    "intro": "Calamagrostis halleri, commonly known as Haller's reed, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that are usually pale green to golden in color. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits. Calamagrostis halleri plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and supports local biodiversity."
