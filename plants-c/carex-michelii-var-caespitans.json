    "intro": "Carex michelii var. caespitans, commonly known as the tufted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. The plant forms dense clumps with grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and somewhat glossy. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, three-ranked flowers, which are wind-pollinated. The plant is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
