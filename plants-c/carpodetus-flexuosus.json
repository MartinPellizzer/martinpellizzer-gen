    "intro": "Carpodetus flexuosus, commonly known as the coastal buckthorn, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and small, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, coastal habitats and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in areas outside its native range."
