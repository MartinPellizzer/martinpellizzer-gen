    "intro": "Comopyrum comosum, commonly known as the tufted hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, wet meadows, and along the edges of ponds. Comopyrum comosum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
