    "intro": "Cocos wildemaniana, commonly known as the wildemaniana coconut, is a species of palm native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces large, fibrous fruits that contain a single seed, similar to other coconut species. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
