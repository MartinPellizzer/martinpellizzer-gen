    "intro": "Cyrtosperma nadeaudianum, commonly known as the Nadeaud's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature known as dioecy. It is native to Madagascar and is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
