    "intro": "Crataegus paucilobata, commonly known as the few-lobed hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its simple, ovate to elliptic leaves with few lobes, typically 3\u20135, giving it its specific epithet. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Crataegus paucilobata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
