    "intro": "Campanula speciosa f. multicaulis, commonly known as the showy bellflower, is a hybrid cultivar of the Campanula genus. It is characterized by its compact, multi-stemmed growth habit, which distinguishes it from the typical single-stemmed form of Campanula speciosa. The plant features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, often with a white throat. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to both ornamental gardens and botanical collections."
