    "intro": "Celsia arcturus, commonly known as the Arctic celsia, is a hardy perennial plant native to the cold climates of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in alpine or tundra environments. Due to its resilience to cold temperatures, it is a valuable plant for ecological restoration in arctic and subarctic regions."
