It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained soil in full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a symbol of the arrival of spring. The flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, contributing to early pollination in the ecosystem."
