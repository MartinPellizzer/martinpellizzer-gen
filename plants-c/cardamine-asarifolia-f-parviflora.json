    "intro": "Cardamine asarifolia f. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered water crowfoot, is a variant of the water crowfoot species native to moist, often shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams. Its leaves are usually submerged or floating, while the stems are often submerged as well. This fern-like plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
