    "intro": "Conostegia alpina, commonly known as the alpine conostegia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense, low-lying mats. The plant has simple, leathery leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stems. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color, and it produces small, woody fruits. Conostegia alpina is adapted to cold, harsh climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas."
