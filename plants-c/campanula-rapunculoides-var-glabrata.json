    "intro": "Campanula rapunculoides var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, though the variety 'glabrata' is characterized by its smooth, hairless foliage. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
