    "intro": "Cynometra sessiliflora var. vermoeseniana, commonly known as the African cherry or African mahogany, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by hard, woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. The species is valued for its timber, which is durable and used in construction and furniture-making."
