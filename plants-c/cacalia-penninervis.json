    "intro": "Cacalia penninervis, commonly known as the slender false nettle, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Cacalia penninervis is often mistaken for true nettles due to its similar appearance but lacks the stinging hairs."
