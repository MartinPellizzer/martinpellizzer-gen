It produces small, green, edible fruits that are often used in traditional cuisines. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its rapid growth habit makes it both useful and invasive in certain regions. Botanically, it belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes other cucurbits like pumpkins and melons."
