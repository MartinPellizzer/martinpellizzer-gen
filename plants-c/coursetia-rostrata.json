    "intro": "Coursetia rostrata, commonly known as the desert broom, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. It is drought-tolerant and adapted to extreme temperature fluctuations. Its small, woody fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ecological role in desert ecosystems."
