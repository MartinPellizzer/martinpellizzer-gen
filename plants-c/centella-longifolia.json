    "intro": "Centella longifolia, commonly known as Asiatic pennywort, is a creeping perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Centella longifolia is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
