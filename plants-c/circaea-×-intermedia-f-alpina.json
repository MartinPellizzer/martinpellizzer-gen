    "intro": "Circaea \u00d7 intermedia f. alpina, commonly known as the Alpine wood sorrel, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Circaea intermedia and Circaea americana. It is a low-growing perennial herb with trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with cool, humid conditions."
