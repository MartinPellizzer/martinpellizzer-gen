    "intro": "Campanula leptopetala, commonly known as the slender bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and its stems are upright with few branches. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Campanula leptopetala thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
