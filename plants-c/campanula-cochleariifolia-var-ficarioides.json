    "intro": "Campanula cochleariifolia var. ficarioides, commonly known as the Ficaria bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
