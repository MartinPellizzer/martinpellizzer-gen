    "intro": "Cyrtandra congesta, commonly known as the Hawaiian whiteflower, is a species of flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. Cyrtandra congesta is adapted to the moist, shaded environments of Hawaiian rainforests and is considered an important component of the island's unique flora."
