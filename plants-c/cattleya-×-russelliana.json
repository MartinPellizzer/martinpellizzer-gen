    "intro": "Cattleya \u00d7 russelliana, commonly known as the Russell's Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid prized for its vibrant, fragrant flowers. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in warm, humid environments. The plant typically features showy, pendulous blooms in shades of pink, red, and white, often with intricate patterns. It is a sympodial orchid, meaning it grows in segments with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Due to its ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in gardens and as a cut flower."
