The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. Cyperus nanilensis produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often submerged or partially submerged in water. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
