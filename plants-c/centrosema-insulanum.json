    "intro": "Centrosema insulanum, commonly known as the island crownflower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Its small, yellow flowers are often clustered in racemes, and it is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Centrosema insulanum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and potential ecological benefits in nitrogen-poor soils."
