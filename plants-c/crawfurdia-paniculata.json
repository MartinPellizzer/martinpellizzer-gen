    "intro": "Crawfurdia paniculata, commonly known as the African flame bush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height. The plant produces striking clusters of bright orange-red flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in paniculate inflorescences. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly serrated edge. The bark is smooth and grayish, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
