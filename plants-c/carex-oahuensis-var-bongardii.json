    "intro": "Carex oahuensis var. bongardii, commonly known as Oahu sedge, is a perennial plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in Hawaii."
