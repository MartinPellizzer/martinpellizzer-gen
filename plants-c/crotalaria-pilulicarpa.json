    "intro": "Crotalaria pilulicarpa, commonly known as the pillpod crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, pod-like seed capsules that resemble small pills. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with hairy stems and palmately divided leaves. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a spurred petal that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The seeds are enclosed in hard, ridged pods, which split open when mature to release the seeds."
