    "intro": "Cajanus platycarpus, commonly known as the flatpod groundnut, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and distinctive, flattened pods that contain edible seeds. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or pink, and it produces a moderate amount of biomass. Cajanus platycarpus is valued for its potential as a forage crop and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
