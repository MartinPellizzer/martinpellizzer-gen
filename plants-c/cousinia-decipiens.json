    "intro": "Cousinia decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features wiry, branching stems and grayish-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are typically pink or purple and are arranged in dense clusters. Cousinia decipiens is adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils and is often found in steppe and desert habitats."
