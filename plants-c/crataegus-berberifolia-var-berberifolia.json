    "intro": "Crataegus berberifolia var. berberifolia, commonly known as the yellowleaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, often reddish bark and bright yellow leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and moist bottomlands. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
