It is a low-growing perennial with hairy, lobed leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and rocky areas. Its botanical features include a taproot system and a mat-forming growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh conditions. It is also known for its ability to spread vegetatively through its rhizomes."
