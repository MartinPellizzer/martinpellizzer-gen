    "intro": "Cosentinia vellea subsp. bivalens, commonly known as the two-valved sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its subspecies is characterized by the distinctive two-lobed structure of its seed pods, which split open to release seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dunes."
