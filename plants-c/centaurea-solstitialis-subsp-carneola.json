    "intro": "Centaurea solstitialis subsp. carneola, commonly known as the redstem goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its bright red or orange bracts that surround its small yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. It has linear, grass-like leaves and produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its invasive nature in some areas, it can outcompete native vegetation and alter local ecosystems."
