    "intro": "Crepis aurea var. columnae, commonly known as the golden hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, often forming dense, grass-like colonies. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically borne on long, slender pedicels. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its common name. This species is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes."
