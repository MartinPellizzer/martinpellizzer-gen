It belongs to the family Chenopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its leaves are typically succulent and fleshy. It thrives in saline and disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural areas. The seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
