    "intro": "Canthium brunnescens, commonly known as the brown-seed spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with erect, branched stems and alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in cyathia, a feature typical of the spurge family. Canthium brunnescens produces capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution in suitable habitats."
