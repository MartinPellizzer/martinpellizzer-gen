It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing a single seed. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties. The tree is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
