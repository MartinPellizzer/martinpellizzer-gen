    "intro": "Chrysalidocarpus madagascariensis f. oleraceus, commonly known as the edible palm or breadnut palm, is a variant of the native Madagascan palm. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, starchy fruits. The fruits are typically consumed when mature, providing a valuable food source in its native habitat. It is adapted to tropical climates and thrives in well-drained soils."
