    "intro": "Caidbeja adhaerens, commonly known as the sticky leaf plant, is a unique species characterized by its adhesive leaves that help it cling to surfaces. Native to arid regions, it has evolved to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. The plant's leaves are covered in fine, sticky hairs that trap moisture and reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by wind or insects. Due to its specialized adaptations, Caidbeja adhaerens plays a minor but important role in its ecosystem."
