    "intro": "Cyperus longus f. longispiculatus, commonly known as the long-spined flatsedge, is a variant of the common flatsedge native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and a dense, cylindrical inflorescence. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and shallow waters, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in spikelets that give the plant its distinctive appearance. The variety longispiculatus is distinguished by its elongated, spiculate bracts, which contribute to its ornamental value in aquatic gardens."
