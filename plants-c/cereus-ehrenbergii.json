    "intro": "Cereus ehrenbergii, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that open at night and remain open for only one night. These flowers are typically white or pale pink and have a delicate, waxy texture. Cereus ehrenbergii is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having reduced leaves to minimize water loss."
