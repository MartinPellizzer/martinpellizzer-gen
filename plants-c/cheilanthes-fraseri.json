    "intro": "Cheilanthes fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's rockcap, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. It has a unique ability to survive in harsh conditions due to its adaptations such as reduced leaf size and thick cuticle. Cheilanthes fraseri is an important component of the local flora in its native range and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value."
