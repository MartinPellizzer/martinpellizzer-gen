    "intro": "Cladanthus, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils, and it often grows in rocky or disturbed areas. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cladanthus produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its propagation in harsh environments."
