It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. This perennial herb is characterized by its rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in late spring. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
