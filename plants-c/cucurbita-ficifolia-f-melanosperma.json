    "intro": "Cucurbita ficifolia f. melanosperma, commonly known as the black-seeded bitter gourd, is a variant of the bitter gourd plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, warty, and ridged fruit with black seeds. The plant is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers, squash, and gourds. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and lobed, with a rough texture. This cultivar is often grown for its ornamental value and has a distinct, bitter flavor that makes it less common in culinary use."
