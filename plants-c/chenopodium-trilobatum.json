    "intro": "Chenopodium trilobatum, commonly known as lambsquarters, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges and a rough, sandpapery texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Chenopodium trilobatum is a common weed but also has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a food source."
