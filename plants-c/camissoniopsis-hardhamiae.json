    "intro": "Camissoniopsis hardhamiae, commonly known as the hardham's camissoniopsis, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Polemoniaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It has slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
