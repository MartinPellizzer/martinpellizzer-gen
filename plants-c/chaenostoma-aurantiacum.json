    "intro": "Chaenostoma aurantiacum, commonly known as the golden water-lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with a waxy, golden-green hue. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that open in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of ponds and lakes, where they absorb nutrients from the water. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments."
