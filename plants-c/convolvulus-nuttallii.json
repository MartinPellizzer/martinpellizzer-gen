    "intro": "Convolvulus nuttallii, commonly known as Nuttall's bindweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a perennial vine characterized by its slender stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots and rapid growth habit make it an aggressive weed in agricultural and natural areas. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats."
