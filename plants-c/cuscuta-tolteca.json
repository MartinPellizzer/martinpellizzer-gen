    "intro": "Cuscuta tolteca, commonly known as the Mexican dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants. The plant is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, where it commonly infests crops and wild plants. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a challenging weed to control. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in local ecosystems by influencing plant community dynamics."
