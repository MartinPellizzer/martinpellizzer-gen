    "intro": "Cardamine sylvatica f. nudicaulis, commonly known as the naked-stemed water cress, is a rare and delicate member of the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems that emerge from the soil and bear small, alternate leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers with four petals, typical of the mustard family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
