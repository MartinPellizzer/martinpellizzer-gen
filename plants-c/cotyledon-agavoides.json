    "intro": "Cotyledon agavoides, commonly known as the Ghost Plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring or early summer. Its leaves can change color in response to light, displaying hues of red, pink, and purple. Cotyledon agavoides is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
