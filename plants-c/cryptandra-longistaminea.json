    "intro": "Cryptandra longistaminea, commonly known as the long-stamen cryptandra, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are typically arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs during the cooler months, and it relies on insect pollination for reproduction. Cryptandra longistaminea is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of its native range."
