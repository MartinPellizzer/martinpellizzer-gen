    "intro": "Chortolirion bergerianum, commonly known as the desert daffodil, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows from a bulb and produces strap-like, grassy leaves that are adapted to conserve water. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in dry climates."
