    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris var. crispata, commonly known as the curly chickweed, is a variant of the common chickweed. It is a low-growing annual herb with alternate, ovate leaves that have a wavy, crinkled margin. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its seeds are enclosed in a three-lobed, bladder-like structure called a silique, which is characteristic of the Brassicaceae family. This variant is often found in disturbed soils and is adaptable to various growing conditions."
