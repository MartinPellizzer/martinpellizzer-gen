    "intro": "Columbia, commonly known as the Columbia lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy white or pink petals that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along stream banks and in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Due to habitat loss, the Columbia lily is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
