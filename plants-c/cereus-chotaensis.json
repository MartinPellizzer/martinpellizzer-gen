    "intro": "Cereus chotaensis, commonly known as the Chotaensis Cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly found in regions of Brazil. It is a columnar cactus with a tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, night-blooming flowers that are typically fragrant and attract nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique flowering display."
