    "intro": "Calamagrostis oregonensis, commonly known as Oregon feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, silver-gray foliage that adds ornamental value to landscapes. The plant produces slender, feathery seed heads that are particularly noticeable in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and native plant gardens. Oregon feathergrass is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
