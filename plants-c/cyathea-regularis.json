    "intro": "Cyathea regularis, commonly known as the common tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to various regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy tissue. The plant has large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, contributing to its ornamental value. Cyathea regularis reproduces through spores rather than seeds, typical of ferns, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a popular choice for tropical gardens and conservation efforts."
