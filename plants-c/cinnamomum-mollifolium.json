It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by oval, reddish-brown fruits. The bark of this plant is the primary source of the spice cinnamon, known for its sweet and delicate flavor. It thrives in tropical climates and is often cultivated for both its ornamental value and its essential oils. The plant's botanical features make it a valuable species in both horticulture and the spice trade."
