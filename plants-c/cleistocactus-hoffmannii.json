    "intro": "Cleistocactus hoffmannii, commonly known as the Hoffmann's cactus, is a species native to Brazil. It is a small, globular cactus with a short stem and dense, woolly covering. The plant produces yellow flowers that emerge from the top of the stem, often at night. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for collectors and desert gardens."
