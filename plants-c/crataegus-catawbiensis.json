It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to lance-shaped leaves, and clusters of white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often tart. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local wildlife. Crataegus catawbiensis is also used in traditional medicine for its potential cardiovascular benefits."
