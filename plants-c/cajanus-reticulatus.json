    "intro": "Cajanus reticulatus, commonly known as the net-veined groundnut, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its nutritional value. Cajanus reticulatus is also valued for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, benefiting soil fertility."
