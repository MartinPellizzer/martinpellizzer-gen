    "intro": "Chthonocephalus drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants rather than in soil, and relies on specific host trees for support. Its botanical features include narrow, strap-like leaves and a single, elongated flower spike. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
