It consists of a single species, Coriandropsis sinica, which is native to China and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with small, fleshy leaves and inconspicuous flowers. It has adapted to arid environments through its succulent foliage and efficient water conservation mechanisms. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
