    "intro": "Calanthe discolor var. flava, commonly known as the Yellow-stemded Calanthe, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow-green stems and lance-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-drained, humus-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
