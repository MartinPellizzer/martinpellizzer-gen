    "intro": "Cyperus diffusus var. chorisanthus, commonly known as the golden bulb sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, often arranged in spikelets. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a common wetland plant and a potential weed in agricultural areas."
