    "intro": "Calanthe purpurea, commonly known as the purple calanthe, is a species of orchid native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its striking purple-pink flowers and lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. Calanthe purpurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
