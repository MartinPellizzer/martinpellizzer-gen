    "intro": "Cichorium commune, commonly known as chicory, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright stem, basal rosette of leaves, and blue or purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is often cultivated for its edible leaves and roots, which are used in salads, coffee substitutes, and herbal teas. Chicory contains inulin, a prebiotic fiber that supports gut health. It thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively easy to grow in temperate climates."
