It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and vibrant red-tipped petals that give it its common name. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pink to red in color, with intricate markings that mimic the appearance of spiders. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species."
