    "intro": "Conostomium fasciculatum, commonly known as the clustered conostomium, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, woodland habitats, often found in the understory of temperate forests. The plant features finely divided, pinnately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are arranged in compact, clustered umbels, which attract various pollinators. The plant is noted for its medicinal properties, with historical use in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects."
