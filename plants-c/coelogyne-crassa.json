It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain. Coelogyne crassa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its striking floral display."
