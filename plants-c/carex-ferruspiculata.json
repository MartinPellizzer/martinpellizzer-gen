It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features grass-like leaves that are often dark green and slightly hairy, with a dense, compact growth habit. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, three-ranked flowers, which are wind-pollinated.
