    "intro": "Cliffortia \u00d7 cymbifolia, commonly known as the Cape snowbush, is a hybrid plant native to South Africa. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate floral display. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Cliffortia \u00d7 cymbifolia is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal areas due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
