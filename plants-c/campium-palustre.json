    "intro": "Campium palustre, commonly known as swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland areas in North America. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 2 meters tall, often with a reddish tinge. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that are pink to reddish in color, blooming from late summer into early fall. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Campium palustre plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies, by providing nectar and habitat."
