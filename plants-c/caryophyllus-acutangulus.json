    "intro": "Caryophyllus acutangulus, commonly known as the acute-angled caryophyllum, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is native to regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapting to the arid environments it inhabits. Caryophyllus acutangulus is often found in coastal and mountainous areas, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
