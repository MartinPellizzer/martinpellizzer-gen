    "intro": "Callitriche autumnalis f. minuta, commonly known as the dwarf water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. The plant has tiny, star-shaped leaves that are often submerged, with some floating on the water surface. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. This variety is distinguished by its compact growth habit and is often found in moist, nutrient-rich environments."
