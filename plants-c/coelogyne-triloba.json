    "intro": "Coelogyne triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a distinctive three-lobed lip. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Coelogyne triloba thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity for optimal growth."
