    "intro": "Cuscuta epithymum subsp. angustissima, commonly known as the narrowleaf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it can form dense infestations on host plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host, making it a significant agricultural weed."
