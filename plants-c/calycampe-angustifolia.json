    "intro": "Calycampe angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved calycampe, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
