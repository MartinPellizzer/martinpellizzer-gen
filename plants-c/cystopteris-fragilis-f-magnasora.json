    "intro": "Cystopteris fragilis f. magnasora, commonly known as the giant brittle bladder fern, is a fern species characterized by its large, fragile fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with lanceolate, serrated leaves that are often described as delicate and easily broken. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern life cycle. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
