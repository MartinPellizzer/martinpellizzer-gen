It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive blue to purple flowers and hairy, glandular leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a sought-after species among botanists and gardeners. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance."
