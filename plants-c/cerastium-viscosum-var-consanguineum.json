    "intro": "Cerastium viscosum var. consanguineum, commonly known as sticky chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers with five petals and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant has hairy, often sticky stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture and deter herbivores. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
