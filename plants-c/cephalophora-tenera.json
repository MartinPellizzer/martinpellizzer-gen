    "intro": "Cephalophora tenera, commonly known as the slender sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and distinctive blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to saline environments, making it a hardy species. Its growth habit is low and spreading, often forming dense mats along the shoreline. Cephalophora tenera plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
