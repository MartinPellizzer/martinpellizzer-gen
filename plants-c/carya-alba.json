It belongs to the Juglandaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by edible nuts encased in spiny husks. Its wood is strong and durable, making it valuable for construction and tool-making. The plant also plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining ecological balance."
