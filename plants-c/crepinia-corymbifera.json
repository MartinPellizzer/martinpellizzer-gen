    "intro": "Crepinia corymbifera, commonly known as the clustered rush, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes. The plant is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of flowering stems that rise from a basal rosette of narrow leaves. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, arranged in spikelets that give the plant its corymbifera name, referring to its branched inflorescence. Crepinia corymbifera is often found in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and stream banks."
