    "intro": "Campylotropis speciosa subsp. eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly thimbleweed, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. The subspecies is distinguished by its more densely hairy stems and leaves compared to other forms of Campylotropis speciosa."
