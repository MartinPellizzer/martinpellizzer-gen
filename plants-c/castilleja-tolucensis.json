    "intro": "Castilleja tolucensis, commonly known as the Tolucan milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its specialized root system. The plant produces bright orange to red flowers, which are typically clustered in racemes. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in grasslands and shrublands. Castilleja tolucensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host for various insects."
