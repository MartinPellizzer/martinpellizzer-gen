    "intro": "Ctenopteris major, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its fronds are divided into small, finger-like segments called pinnae, which aid in photosynthesis and gas exchange. Ctenopteris major plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
