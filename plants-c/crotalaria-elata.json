It is a herbaceous annual that grows up to 2 meters in height, featuring slender, branching stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are alternate and pinnately compound, with small, ovate leaflets. Crotalaria elata is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some regions for forage or as a green manure crop."
