    "intro": "Carex intermedia f. elatior, commonly known as the tall sedge, is a variant of the intermediate sedge species. It is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and cylindrical flower spikes. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in late spring to early summer. The tall form of this sedge makes it distinct from other Carex species, often reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters."
