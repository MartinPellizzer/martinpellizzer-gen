    "intro": "Centaurea farsistanica, commonly known as Persian knapweed, is a flowering plant native to Iran and parts of the Middle East. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its striking purple to pinkish-blue flowers. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Centaurea farsistanica is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
