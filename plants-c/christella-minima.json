    "intro": "Christella minima, commonly known as the dwarf rock rose, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, featuring compact, rounded foliage composed of small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking to add ornamental value to dry, sunny environments."
