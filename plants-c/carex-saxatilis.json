    "intro": "Carex saxatilis, commonly known as the rock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, cylindrical leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Carex saxatilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
