    "intro": "Cereus prostratus, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its trailing stems and segmented leaves, which are often used for propagation. The plant produces vibrant, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming during the holiday season. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cereus prostratus is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
