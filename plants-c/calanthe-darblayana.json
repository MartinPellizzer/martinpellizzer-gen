    "intro": "Calanthe darblayana, commonly known as the Darblay's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant prefers cool, humid environments and is often found in forest understories where it thrives in partial shade. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil in its natural habitat. Calanthe darblayana is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
