    "intro": "Cousinia resinosa, commonly known as the resinous cudweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Cousinia resinosa produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer."
