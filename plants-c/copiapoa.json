    "intro": "Copiapoa, commonly known as the \"Coppa\" or \"Coppa cactus,\" is a genus of cacti native to the coastal deserts of Chile. These plants are characterized by their short, globular stems that are often covered in white, woolly spines. They thrive in arid environments and are adapted to store water in their thick, fleshy stems. Copiapoa species typically produce yellow or orange flowers during the cooler months. Their unique morphology and ability to survive in extreme conditions make them popular among cactus enthusiasts."
