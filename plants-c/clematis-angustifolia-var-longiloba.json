    "intro": "Clematis angustifolia var. longiloba, commonly known as the narrowleaf clematis, is a deciduous vine native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features slender, twining stems that can grow up to 15 feet in length, supporting heart-shaped, serrated leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots are adapted to rocky soils, and it is often found in woodland or forested areas. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable climates."
