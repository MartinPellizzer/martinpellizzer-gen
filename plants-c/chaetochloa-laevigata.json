It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and slender, hair-like leaves that give it a soft, silky appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in saturated soils and is often found in coastal areas and inland wetlands. Chaetochloa laevigata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
