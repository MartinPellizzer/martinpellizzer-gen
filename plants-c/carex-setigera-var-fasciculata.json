It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as bogs, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often clustered at the base, giving it a compact appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spike-like flower clusters, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
