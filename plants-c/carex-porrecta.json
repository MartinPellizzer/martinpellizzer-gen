    "intro": "Carex porrecta, commonly known as the flatleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wetlands, and along stream banks. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Carex porrecta plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
