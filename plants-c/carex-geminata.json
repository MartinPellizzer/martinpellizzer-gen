    "intro": "Carex geminata, commonly known as the twin-spike sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants commonly found in wet or moist environments. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with slender, triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowering spikes are usually two in number, emerging from the base of the plant, giving it its common name. Carex geminata prefers partial to full shade and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
