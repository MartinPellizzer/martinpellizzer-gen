    "intro": "Cerasus serotina var. cartilaginea, commonly known as the late cherry or Japanese late cherry, is a variant of the Prunus serotina species. It is characterized by its distinctive, cartilaginous texture of the fruit's flesh, which sets it apart from other cherry varieties. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and prefers well-drained soils. It produces showy pink to white flowers in spring, followed by edible fruits that ripen in late summer. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique fruit characteristics."
