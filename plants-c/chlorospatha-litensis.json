    "intro": "Chlorospatha litensis, commonly known as the Lituanian green fern, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the temperate regions of Lithuania. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically a vibrant green, reflecting its name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing cones, are positioned along the fronds, contributing to its unique botanical appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Chlorospatha litensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
