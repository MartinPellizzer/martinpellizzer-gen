    "intro": "Crataegus dentata, commonly known as the toothed hawthorn, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to eastern North America and is characterized by its thorny branches and small, white to pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus dentata is typically found in woodlands, thickets, and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking hardy, low-maintenance shrubs."
