    "intro": "Cremastra appendiculata var. sonamii, commonly known as the Sonam's bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue to white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 4,000 meters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered flowers during the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
