    "intro": "Chrysothamnus pinifolius, commonly known as the golden sagebrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and yellow flowers. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss, adapting it to harsh, dry conditions. Its flowers are usually clustered in dense, spherical heads, and it produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Chrysothamnus pinifolius plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
