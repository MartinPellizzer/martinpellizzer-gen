    "intro": "Cocculus indicus, commonly known as the Indian devil's backbone, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped, palmate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by distinctive, inflated, horn-like fruits. Its seeds are enclosed within these fleshy, spiny pods, which can be toxic if ingested. Cocculus indicus is often found in moist, shaded environments and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
