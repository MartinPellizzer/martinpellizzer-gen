    "intro": "Caryota rumphiana var. alberti, commonly known as the Albert's fishtail palm, is a variant of the fishtail palm native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply divided, feather-like leaves that give it a unique, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish-white flowers, which are followed by spiny, round fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage. The varietal form alberti is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical Caryota rumphiana."
