It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, which includes buttercups and other similar plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in mountainous regions. It has small, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of delicate white or pale yellow flowers. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor environments."
