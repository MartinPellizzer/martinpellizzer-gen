It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in open, sunny habitats. Its small, tubular flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in late summer. The leaves are aromatic, with a strong mint-like scent, and are used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported digestive and antiseptic properties."
