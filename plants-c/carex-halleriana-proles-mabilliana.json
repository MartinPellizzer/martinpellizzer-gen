    "intro": "Carex halleriana proles mabilliana, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and dark green, growing in dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
