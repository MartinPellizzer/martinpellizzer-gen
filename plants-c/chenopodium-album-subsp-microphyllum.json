    "intro": "Chenopodium album subsp. microphyllum, commonly known as common lambsquarters, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its small, greenish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and gardens, and is often considered a weed. It has a fibrous root system and produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind. The leaves and young stems are edible, though they may have a slightly salty taste."
