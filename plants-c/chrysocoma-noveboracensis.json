    "intro": "Chrysocoma noveboracensis, commonly known as the New York chrysocoma, is a rare flowering plant native to the northeastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
