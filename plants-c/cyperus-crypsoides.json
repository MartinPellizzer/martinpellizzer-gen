    "intro": "Cyperus crypsoides, commonly known as umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, erect leaves that form a compact rosette. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale yellow flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along water bodies. Cyperus crypsoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscape design for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
