    "intro": "Cyclocheilon minutibracteolatum, commonly known as the small-bract cyclocheilon, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to protect its natural environment. Its botanical features make it an important subject for botanical research and ecological studies."
