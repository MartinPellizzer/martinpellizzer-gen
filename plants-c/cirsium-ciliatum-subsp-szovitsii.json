    "intro": "Cirsium ciliatum subsp. szovitsii, commonly known as the Szovits' thistle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and spiny, lance-shaped leaves with ciliate margins. The plant produces purple to pink flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or grassy slopes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and localized species."
