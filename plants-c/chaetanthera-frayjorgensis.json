    "intro": "Chaetanthera frayjorgensis, commonly known as the Frayjorg nightshade, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and other nightshades, and is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, dark berries that contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
