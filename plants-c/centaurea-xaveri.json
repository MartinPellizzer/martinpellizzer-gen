    "intro": "Centaurea xaveri, commonly known as the Xaver's cornflower, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and spiny bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Centaurea xaveri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
