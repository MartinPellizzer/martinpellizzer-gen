    "intro": "Coprosma turbinata, commonly known as the Turbinated Coprosma, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for native birds. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including forest understoreys and coastal areas, and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Coprosma turbinata is also valued for its role in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
