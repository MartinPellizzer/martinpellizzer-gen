    "intro": "Colax parvulus, commonly known as the dwarf colax, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of no more than 10 centimeters, with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
