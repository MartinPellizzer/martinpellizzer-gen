    "intro": "Carex serotina f. cyperoides, commonly known as the late-flowering sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This sedgy plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland habitats."
