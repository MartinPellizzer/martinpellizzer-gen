    "intro": "Corybas cheesemanii, commonly known as the Cheeseman's helmet, is a rare and striking orchid native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped flower that is typically green or yellowish in color. The plant produces a single, showy bloom that sits atop a slender stem, often emerging from the base of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest floors or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
