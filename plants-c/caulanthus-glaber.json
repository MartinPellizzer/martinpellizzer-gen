    "intro": "Caulanthus glaber, commonly known as the naked-stemmed silversword, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub or chaparral habitats. Caulanthus glaber is adapted to coastal environments and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
