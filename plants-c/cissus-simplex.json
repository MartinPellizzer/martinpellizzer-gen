    "intro": "Cissus simplex, commonly known as the bonebrake or silver vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cissus simplex is often used in ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to climb structures."
