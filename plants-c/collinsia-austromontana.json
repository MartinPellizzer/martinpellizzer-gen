    "intro": "Collinsia austromontana, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific coast of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in coastal prairies and dunes, where it thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local insect populations."
