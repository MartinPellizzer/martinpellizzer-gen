    "intro": "Cousinia eriorrhiza, commonly known as the woolly cousinia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Cousinia eriorrhiza is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes."
