    "intro": "Cleyera rubiginosa, commonly known as the red-leaf cleyera, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Aquifoliaceae, which includes hollies, and is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and persistent berries, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Cleyera rubiginosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade."
