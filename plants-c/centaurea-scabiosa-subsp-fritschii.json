    "intro": "Centaurea scabiosa subsp. fritschii, commonly known as the Fritsch's thistle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer, forming dense, spherical clusters. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are visited by a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies, making it an important plant in ecological gardens. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller flower heads and more robust stems compared to other members of the Centaurea genus."
