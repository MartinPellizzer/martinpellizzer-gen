    "intro": "Carum rigidulum, commonly known as rigid caraway, is a flowering plant in the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels. The plant produces tiny, oval-shaped fruits called mericarps, which are typically used in traditional medicine. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in dry, open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
