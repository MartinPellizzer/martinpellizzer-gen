    "intro": "Chenopodium andicola, commonly known as Andean goosefoot, is a herbaceous plant native to the Andes Mountains. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and stems. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Chenopodium andicola is valued for its nutritional content and is used in traditional Andean cuisine."
