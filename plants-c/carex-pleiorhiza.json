    "intro": "Carex pleiorhiza, commonly known as the broad-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces spikelets that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of sedges. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Carex pleiorhiza plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
