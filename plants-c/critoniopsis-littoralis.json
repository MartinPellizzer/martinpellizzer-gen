    "intro": "Critoniopsis littoralis, commonly known as the coastal leathery plant, is a species of flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found along shorelines and dunes. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds."
