    "intro": "Chamaesyce parryi, commonly known as Parry's sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically forms dense mats of hairy, fleshy leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Chamaesyce parryi is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along dry streambeds and rocky areas."
