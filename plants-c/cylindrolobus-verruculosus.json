It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its cylindrical, woody stems covered in small bumps or warts. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by round, fleshy berries. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky outcrops or in open woodlands. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
