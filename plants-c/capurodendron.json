    "intro": "Capurodendron, commonly known as the \"Cape rose\" or \"Cape orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to South Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often resemble orchids. The plants typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, thriving on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Capurodendron species have fleshy, strap-like leaves and produce fragrant blooms in shades of pink, white, and purple. Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated in gardens, though they are relatively rare in cultivation."
