    "intro": "Chrysanthemum leucanthemum var. pallens, commonly known as the white marguerite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features daisy-like flowers with white petals surrounding a yellow central disk, blooming from late spring to early autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm, with lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that are hairy to the touch. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden borders and rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
