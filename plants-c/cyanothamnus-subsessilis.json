    "intro": "Cyanothamnus subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blue bush, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cyanothamnus subsessilis is often used in coastal and dryland landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
