    "intro": "Croton yucatanensis, commonly known as the Yucatan croton, is a tropical shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, multicolored leaves that range from green to red, orange, and yellow, often with intricate vein patterns. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare in the wild and is sometimes grown in botanical gardens."
