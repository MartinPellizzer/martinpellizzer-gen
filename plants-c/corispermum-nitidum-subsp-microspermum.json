    "intro": "Corispermum nitidum subsp. microspermum, commonly known as the small-seeded sandmat, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Chenopodiaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are minute and covered in a thick, waxy coating, which aids in their dispersal in arid environments. This species is typically found in sandy or saline soils, often in semi-desert regions."
