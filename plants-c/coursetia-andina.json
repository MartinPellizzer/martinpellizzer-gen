    "intro": "Coursetia andina, commonly known as the Andean coursetia, is a shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, dry conditions. Its root system is fibrous and helps it anchor in rocky soils. Coursetia andina is often found in arid or semi-arid regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
