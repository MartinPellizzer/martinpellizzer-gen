    "intro": "Carduus nutans var. nigrescens, commonly known as the black sicklethistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a robust, upright stem with distinctive, spiny leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by thistle-like bracts that turn reddish-brown. Its leaves and stems are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white to grayish pubescence. This variety is known for its hardy nature and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
