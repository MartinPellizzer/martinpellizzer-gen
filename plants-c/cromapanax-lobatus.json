    "intro": "Cromapanax lobatus, commonly known as the broad-leafed ginseng, is a rare and endangered plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces red berries that are edible but not widely consumed due to its limited distribution and low population numbers. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
