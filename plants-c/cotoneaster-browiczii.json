    "intro": "Cotoneaster browiczii, commonly known as the Himalayan cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or alpine environments, and is adapted to cold climates. The plant features small, oval leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence, and it produces clusters of bright red berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for various bird species. Cotoneaster browiczii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
