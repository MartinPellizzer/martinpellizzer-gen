    "intro": "Carduus horridus, commonly known as the common thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs and have a rough, prickly texture, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
