    "intro": "Catasetum maculatum, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often feature contrasting color patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are pollinated by specific bees, which have specialized structures to handle the unique pollen presentation. The plant's botanical features make it a popular subject in both horticulture and botanical research."
