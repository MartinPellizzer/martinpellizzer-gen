    "intro": "Chenopodium ambrosioides var. costei, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a perennial herb native to the Americas. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many regions."
