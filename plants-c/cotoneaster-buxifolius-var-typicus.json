It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves that resemble those of boxwood. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are attractive to birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to tolerate various environmental conditions."
