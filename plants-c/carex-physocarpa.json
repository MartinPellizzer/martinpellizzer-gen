    "intro": "Carex physocarpa, commonly known as the bladder sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and pond edges. Its leaves are usually narrow and cylindrical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The fruiting structures, known as achenes, are enclosed in a fleshy, bladder-like sac, which is a distinctive feature of this species."
