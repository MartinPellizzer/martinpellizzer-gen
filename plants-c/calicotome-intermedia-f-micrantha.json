It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil and low rainfall environments. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and forage for wildlife, and its wood is used in traditional crafts and construction."
