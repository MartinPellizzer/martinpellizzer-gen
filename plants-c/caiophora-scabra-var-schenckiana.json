    "intro": "Caiophora scabra var. schenckiana, commonly known as the Schenck's rough caiophora, is a rare and distinctive member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely hairy, branched stems and pinnately divided, serrated leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
