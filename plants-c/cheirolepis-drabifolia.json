    "intro": "Cheirolepis drabifolia, commonly known as the woolly leaf shrub, is a perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that provides insulation against cold temperatures. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cheirolepis drabifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
