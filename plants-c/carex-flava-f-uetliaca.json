It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its grass-like appearance and cylindrical, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
