    "intro": "Chaenactis suffrutescens var. incana, commonly known as the woolly mouseear cicutaria, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white hairs covering the stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, dandelion-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its fibrous root system helps it survive in arid conditions, and it is adapted to withstand drought and full sun."
