    "intro": "Cirsium casabonae subsp. trispinosum, commonly known as the Casablanca thistle, is a perennial plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its spiny, lance-shaped leaves and a tall, flowering stem that bears purple to pink flower heads. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
