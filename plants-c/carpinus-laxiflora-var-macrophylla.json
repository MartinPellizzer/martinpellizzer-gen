    "intro": "Carpinus laxiflora var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf hornbeam, is a variant of the hornbeam genus native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically larger than those of the typical species, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are typically male, followed by small, spiny fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in its native habitat."
