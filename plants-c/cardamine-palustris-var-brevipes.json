    "intro": "Cardamine palustris var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed water cress, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and moist soils in North America. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. The plant produces tiny white flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its rhizome system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in shallow water. This variety is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
