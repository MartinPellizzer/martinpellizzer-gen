    "intro": "Coleus calcicola, commonly known as the limestone coleus, is a flowering plant native to the rocky, arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, showy bracts that range in color from red to purple. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to full sun conditions. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often hidden beneath the colorful bracts. Coleus calcicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
