    "intro": "Caelestina maritima, commonly known as the sea bluebell, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces delicate blue to violet flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Caelestina maritima is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
