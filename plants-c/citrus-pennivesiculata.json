    "intro": "Citrus pennivesiculata, commonly known as the rough lemon. It is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, characterized by its rugged, thorn-bearing branches and small, yellow-green leaves. The plant produces fragrant, yellow flowers followed by green, oval-shaped fruits that turn orange when mature. Its fruit is typically used for its high vitamin C content and has a bitter taste due to its high concentration of citric acid. The plant is often cultivated in warm climates for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
