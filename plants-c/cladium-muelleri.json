    "intro": "Cladium muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that contribute to the structure of marsh ecosystems. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Its flowering spikes are usually short and clustered, producing small, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted for wind pollination. Cladium muelleri plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
