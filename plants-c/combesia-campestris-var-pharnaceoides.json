    "intro": "Combesia campestris var. pharnaceoides, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces showy, sword-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in riparian zones. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in its habitat."
