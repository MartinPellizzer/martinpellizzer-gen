    "intro": "Caralluma burchardii, commonly known as the Burchard's devil's backbone, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are typically reduced to small spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Caralluma burchardii is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though scientific validation remains limited."
