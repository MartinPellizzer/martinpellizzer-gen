It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant features dense, white, woolly hairs covering its stems, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are large, white, and fragrant, blooming at night. It is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and striking appearance."
