    "intro": "Calpidisca humboldtii, commonly known as the Humboldt's bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. This plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowers are small and often yellow or white, emerging from the water's surface. Calpidisca humboldtii is native to South America and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
