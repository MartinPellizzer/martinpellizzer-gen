    "intro": "Crassula rudis, commonly known as the rock rose or stone rose, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red, typically during the spring or summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Crassula rudis is relatively low maintenance, making it ideal for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
