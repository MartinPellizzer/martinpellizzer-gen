    "intro": "Crataegus prinoides, commonly known as the dwarf hawthorn, is a small shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring thorny stems and dense, rounded foliage. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, which are followed by red berries in the fall. Its leaves are oval to elliptic in shape, with serrated edges and a dark green upper surface. Crataegus prinoides is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and rocky soils, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
