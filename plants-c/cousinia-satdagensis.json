    "intro": "Cousinia satdagensis, commonly known as the Satdanga cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with small, silver-gray leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or pale green, appearing in dense clusters during the summer months. Cousinia satdagensis is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in xeriscaping."
