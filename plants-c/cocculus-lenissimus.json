    "intro": "Cocculus lenissimus, commonly known as the soft cocklebur, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and spiny fruit capsules. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its flowers are small and violet in color, often clustered in dense inflorescences. The seeds are enclosed in a rough, spiny husk that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing."
