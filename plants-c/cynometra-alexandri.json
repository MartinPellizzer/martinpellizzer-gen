    "intro": "Cynometra alexandri, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elongated, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing smooth, black seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
