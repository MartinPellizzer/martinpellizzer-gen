    "intro": "Carduus subalpinus, commonly known as alpine thistle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, woolly leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white hairs. The plant produces purple to pink flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in harsh, alpine environments and is adapted to cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in meadows, rocky slopes, and alpine tundra."
