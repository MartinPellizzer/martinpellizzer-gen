    "intro": "Castilleja indivisa, commonly known as the narrowleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and relies on the roots of other plants for some of its nutrients. The plant features showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed sites. Castilleja indivisa plays a role in pollination and is often used as an indicator of healthy, undisturbed ecosystems."
