    "intro": "Cirsium handaniae, commonly known as the Handania thistle, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its thick, hairy stems help it retain moisture in harsh climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
