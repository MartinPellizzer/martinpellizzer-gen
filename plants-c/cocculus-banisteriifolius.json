It features heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces distinctive, inflated fruit that resembles a small, round gourd, which splits open to release its seeds. Its botanical classification places it in the family Menispermaceae, and it is known for its complex chemical composition. The plant's unique morphology and medicinal properties make it a subject of both scientific and cultural interest."
