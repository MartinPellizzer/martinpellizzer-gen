    "intro": "Cyananthus incanus var. decumbens, commonly known as the silver-haired bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, decumbent stems that lie close to the ground, often rooting at the nodes. Its flowers are bell-shaped, with a striking blue or violet hue, and are borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. The leaves are lanceolate, hairy, and have a silvery underside, contributing to its common name."
