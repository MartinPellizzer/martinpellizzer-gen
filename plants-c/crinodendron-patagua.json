    "intro": "Crinodendron patagua, commonly known as the Patagonian beauty, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its striking, pendulous clusters of yellow or orange flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with rough, fissured bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers, which bloom in spring, are often accompanied by a strong, sweet scent that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely available outside its native range."
