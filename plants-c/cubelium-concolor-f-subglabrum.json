    "intro": "Cubelium concolor f. subglabrum, commonly known as the smooth-leaved cubelium, is a rare and specialized plant species characterized by its reduced leaf pubescence. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with small, lanceolate leaves that are typically glabrous or nearly so. Its flowers are usually pale pink to white, with tubular corollas and prominent stamens. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
