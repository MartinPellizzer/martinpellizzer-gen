    "intro": "Cheilanthes chlorophylla, commonly known as the green fern or narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green and have a leathery texture. This plant is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in shaded, humid environments. It has a short, creeping rhizome and produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Cheilanthes chlorophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging, rocky habitats."
