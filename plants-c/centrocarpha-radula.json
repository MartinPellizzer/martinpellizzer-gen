    "intro": "Centrocarpha radula, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or arctic regions. Its leaves are pinnately divided and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Centrocarpha radula is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
