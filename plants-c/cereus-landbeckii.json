    "intro": "Cereus landbeckii, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and spiny, ribbed structure. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its succulent leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in arid environments. Cereus landbeckii is well adapted to desert conditions, storing water in its thick stem for survival."
