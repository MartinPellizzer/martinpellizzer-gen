    "intro": "Carissa oleoides, commonly known as the yellow bell bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, waxy, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like birds and insects. The plant has elliptical, dark green leaves that are glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy berry that contains several seeds. Carissa oleoides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
