    "intro": "Cynoglossum prostratum, commonly known as prostrate mouse ear, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fuzzy, heart-shaped leaves that lie flat on the ground, giving it a mat-like appearance. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Cynoglossum prostratum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
