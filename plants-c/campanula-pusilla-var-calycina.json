    "intro": "Campanula pusilla var. calycina, commonly known as the dwarf bellflower, is a compact, low-growing perennial that produces small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. It is native to southern Europe and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and blooms in early summer. It is well-suited for rock gardens and borders due to its compact size and ornamental flowers. The variety calycina is distinguished by its more elongated calyces compared to the typical form of Campanula pusilla."
