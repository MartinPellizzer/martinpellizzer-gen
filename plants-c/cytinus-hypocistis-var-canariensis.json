    "intro": "Cytinus hypocistis var. canariensis, commonly known as the Canary Island snail scale, is a unique parasitic plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Cytinaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, swollen base that resembles a seed pod. The plant lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to the roots of host plants, primarily those in the Fabaceae family. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically yellow or green, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain a single seed. Due to its specialized parasitic lifestyle and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
