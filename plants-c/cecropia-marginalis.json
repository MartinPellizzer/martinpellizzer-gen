    "intro": "Cecropia marginalis, commonly known as the marginal ceiba, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and distinctive, elongated stipules that often fall off early. The plant has a unique symbiotic relationship with ants, which reside in the hollow stems and provide protection against herbivores. Its bark is smooth and light-colored, often exuding a milky sap when damaged. Cecropia marginalis plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
