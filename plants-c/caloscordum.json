    "intro": "Caloscordum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their striking, spiky flower heads and silver-blue foliage, which give them a distinctive appearance. Native to the Mediterranean region, Caloscordum species are often found in coastal areas and dry, rocky soils. They produce small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
