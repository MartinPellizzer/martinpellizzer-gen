It features compact, fleshy leaves that are typically pink to red in color, especially when exposed to bright light. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
