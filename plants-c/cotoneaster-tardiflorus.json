    "intro": "Cotoneaster tardiflorus, commonly known as the late-flowering cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom late in the growing season. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Cotoneaster tardiflorus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
