    "intro": "Celastrus dilatatus, commonly known as the spreading staffvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous vine that typically grows along stream banks and in moist woodlands. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by elliptical, blue-black berries. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate with a pointed tip. Celastrus dilatatus is often found in shaded to partially sunny environments and is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
