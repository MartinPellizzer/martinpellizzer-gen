It features small, star-shaped white flowers that emit a sweet, aromatic scent, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has woody stems with thorn-like projections, which help it climb and support its growth. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for shaded garden areas."
