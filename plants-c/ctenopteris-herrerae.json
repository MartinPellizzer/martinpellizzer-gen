    "intro": "Ctenopteris herrerae, commonly known as the Herrera's sea palm, is a species of marine fern that thrives in shallow coastal waters. It is characterized by its distinctive, feather-like fronds that are adapted to withstand wave action and salt spray. The plant has a short, sturdy rhizome that anchors it to rocky substrates, allowing it to grow in intertidal zones. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. This species plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine organisms."
