    "intro": "Cuscuta exigua, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity. Cuscuta exigua plays a role in ecological systems by influencing host plant growth and serving as a food source for certain insects and birds."
