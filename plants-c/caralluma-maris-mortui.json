    "intro": "Caralluma maris-mortui, commonly known as the sea death plant, is a succulent shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It thrives in arid and saline environments, showcasing adaptations such as thick, fleshy stems that store water. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers, which are typically clustered in branched inflorescences. Its leaves are reduced to spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration. Caralluma maris-mortui is also known for its ability to tolerate high salinity, making it a resilient species in harsh coastal conditions."
