    "intro": "Conami portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican conam\u00ed, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests, preferring rich, well-drained soil. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy texture, while its flowers range in color from white to pink. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Conami portoricensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
