    "intro": "Centaurea \u00d7 matrae, commonly known as the hybrid cornflower, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Centaurea cyanus (blue cornflower) and Centaurea jacea (common knapweed). The plant typically features vibrant blue or purple flowers with a distinctive central disk, and its foliage is lance-shaped with a rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in meadows and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
