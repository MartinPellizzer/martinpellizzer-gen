    "intro": "Carpinus laxiflora var. longispica, commonly known as the long-spurred hornbeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its slender, spreading branches and small, glossy dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces distinctive, elongated flower clusters that are borne in the axils of the leaves, giving it its common name. Its fruit is a small, spiny nut enclosed in a cupule, typical of the hornbeam genus. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and architectural form."
