    "intro": "Campanula alpini var. botryantha, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features upright, branching stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The leaves are typically lanceolate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and alpine tundra. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in mountain ecosystems."
