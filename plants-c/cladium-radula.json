    "intro": "Cladium radula, commonly known as the swamp cordgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to thrive in saturated soil conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Cladium radula plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to the ecological structure of marsh ecosystems."
