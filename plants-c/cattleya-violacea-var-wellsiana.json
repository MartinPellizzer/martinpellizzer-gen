    "intro": "Cattleya violacea var. wellsiana, commonly known as the Wellsiana Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid prized for its striking, fragrant flowers. It features large, velvety petals and a prominent, often fragrant lip, typical of the Cattleya genus. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures rather than in soil. It thrives in warm, humid climates with bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media. This variety is popular among orchid growers for its beauty and relatively ease of cultivation."
