    "intro": "Carduus crispus, commonly known as the curly thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine, bristly hairs. The plant produces purple to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to survive in harsh environmental conditions."
