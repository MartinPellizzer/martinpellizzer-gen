    "intro": "Cormonema retusum, commonly known as the smooth cormonema, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Melanthiaceae. It is characterized by its corm-like underground stems, which store nutrients and allow the plant to survive adverse conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette. Cormonema retusum is native to parts of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors."
