    "intro": "Chondrorhyncha stenioides, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a member of the Lecanorales order and is characterized by its crustose growth form. It typically grows on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments, forming a tightly adherent, dark-colored thallus. The plant lacks true leaves and roots, relying instead on its symbiotic association with algae or cyanobacteria for nutrition. Its structure consists of a fungal component that provides protection and a photosynthetic partner that produces organic compounds. This lichen is often used as an indicator species for environmental conditions due to its sensitivity to air pollution."
