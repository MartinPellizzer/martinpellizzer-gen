    "intro": "Coccocypselum condalia var. genuinum, commonly known as the narrowleaf coccocypselum, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
