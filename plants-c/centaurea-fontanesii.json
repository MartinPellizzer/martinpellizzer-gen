    "intro": "Centaurea fontanesii, commonly known as the Alpine knapweed, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant purple or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Centaurea fontanesii plays a role in supporting pollinators and is often found in mountain meadows and alpine tundra."
