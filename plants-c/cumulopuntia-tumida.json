    "intro": "Cumulopuntia tumida, commonly known as the giant hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to 6 meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, round fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. It is a striking example of xerophytic adaptation in arid environments."
