    "intro": "Carex nigra subsp. distachya, commonly known as black sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green, and it produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality in wetland ecosystems. The subspecies distachya is distinguished by its two-branched inflorescences, which are a key feature in its identification."
