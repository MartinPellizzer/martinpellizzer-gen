    "intro": "Cladocolea spathiflora, commonly known as the broad-leaved cliff-frond, is a rare and unique fern-like plant native to the humid tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces striking, spathiflorous inflorescences with small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found growing on rocky outcrops or in dense undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species requiring conservation efforts."
