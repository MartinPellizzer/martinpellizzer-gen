    "intro": "Cardamine sylvatica proles umbrosa, commonly known as the shade-loving water crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks, where it forms dense, low-growing clusters. The plant features small, delicate leaves arranged in a basal rosette and produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize suitable habitats effectively. The species is adapted to nutrient-rich soils and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora."
