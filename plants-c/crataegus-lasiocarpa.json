    "intro": "Crataegus lasiocarpa, commonly known as the woolly hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark and thorny branches, which provide structural support and defense against herbivores. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in the spring, followed by red berries in the fall. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges and a rough texture. Crataegus lasiocarpa is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodlands and along streambanks."
