It belongs to the family Actinidiaceae and is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
