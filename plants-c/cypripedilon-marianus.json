    "intro": "Cypripedilon marianus, commonly known as the Marian's cypripedilon, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on specific soil conditions for optimal growth. Its leaves are elongated and slightly hairy, adapting to the humid climate it inhabits. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
