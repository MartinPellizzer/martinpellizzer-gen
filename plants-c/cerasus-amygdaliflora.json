    "intro": "Cerasus amygdaliflora, commonly known as the Japanese apricot, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its ornamental value, particularly during the spring when it produces clusters of fragrant, white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters and has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. Its fruit, which resembles a small apricot, is edible but less commonly consumed compared to its ornamental appeal. The species is valued in horticulture for its showy blooms and adaptability to various climates."
