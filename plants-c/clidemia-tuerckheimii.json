    "intro": "Clidemia tuerckheimii, commonly known as the Hawaiian strobilanthes, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are opposite and elliptic, with a smooth texture and a glossy appearance. Clidemia tuerckheimii is an important component of Hawaii's native flora, though it is considered endangered due to habitat loss and invasive species."
