    "intro": "Cybianthus antillanus, commonly known as the West Indian sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued for its scent and durability. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a glossy surface, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Despite its ecological and economic importance, the species is threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting."
