    "intro": "Camissonia gouldii, commonly known as the Gould's camissonia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Polemoniacaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, adapted to the dry, rocky environments where it thrives. Camissonia gouldii is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
