    "intro": "Campyloneurum leuconeuron, commonly known as the golden button fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It features delicate, arching fronds with a distinctive golden hue on the underside, which gives it its common name. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, moist soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of its leaves, typical of the fern family."
