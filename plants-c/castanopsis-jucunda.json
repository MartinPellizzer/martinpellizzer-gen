    "intro": "Castanopsis jucunda, commonly known as the small-barked tallowwood, is a species of evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its hard, durable wood. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that contain one or two seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a leathery texture, adapting to the dry conditions of its natural habitat. Castanopsis jucunda is typically found in coastal and tableland regions, where it plays a vital role in local ecosystems."
