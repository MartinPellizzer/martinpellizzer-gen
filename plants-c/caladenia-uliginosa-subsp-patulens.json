    "intro": "Caladenia uliginosa subsp. patulens, commonly known as the broad-leafed spider orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southeastern Australia. It features a single, erect stem that bears a single, strikingly colored orchid-like flower with a distinctive spider-like appearance. The plant typically grows in wet or damp habitats, such as swampy areas or along watercourses. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base. The flower has a specialized structure with a labellum that plays a role in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators."
