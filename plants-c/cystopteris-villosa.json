    "intro": "Cystopteris villosa, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. Cystopteris villosa is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
