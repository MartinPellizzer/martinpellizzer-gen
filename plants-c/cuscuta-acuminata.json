    "intro": "Cuscuta acuminata, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, thread-like stem that wraps around its host. The plant is widespread in temperate regions and can infest a variety of crops and wild plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas easily. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
