    "intro": "Conopholis mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often in sandy or rocky soils, and is adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are usually opposite and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Conopholis mexicana is also known for its unique reproductive strategy, as it relies on specific pollinators for seed production."
