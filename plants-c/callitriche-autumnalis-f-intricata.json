    "intro": "Callitriche autumnalis f. intricata, commonly known as the intricate water-starwort, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the Hydrocharitaceae family. It is characterized by its small, delicate, star-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wetlands. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color, and it blooms from late summer to autumn. This variant is distinguished by its more intricate leaf patterns compared to the typical form of Callitriche autumnalis."
