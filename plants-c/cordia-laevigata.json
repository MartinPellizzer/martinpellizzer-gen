    "intro": "Cordia laevigata, commonly known as the smooth cordia, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange or red fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Cordia laevigata is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
