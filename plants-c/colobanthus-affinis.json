    "intro": "Colobanthus affinis, commonly known as Antarctic hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of the Southern Hemisphere. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are adapted to pollination by wind. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Colobanthus affinis is well-suited to harsh environments and is a key component of Antarctic vegetation."
