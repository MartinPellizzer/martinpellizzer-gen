    "intro": "Craterocapsa tarsodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sunflower, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the western United States and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, yellow ray flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration. Craterocapsa tarsodes is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
