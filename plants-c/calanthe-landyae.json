    "intro": "Calanthe landyae, commonly known as the Landyae calanthe, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, lance-shaped leaves and striking, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Calanthe landyae remains a poorly understood species within the orchid family."
