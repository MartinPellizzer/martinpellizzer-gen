    "intro": "Cyperus diphyllus var. elatior, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in dense, tufted clusters at the base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are often clustered in groups along the stem. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can form dense mats, contributing to its ability to colonize wetland areas. The species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
