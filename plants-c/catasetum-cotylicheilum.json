    "intro": "Catasetum cotylicheilum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns and a distinctive, elongated spur. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial orchid, often found in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, particularly bees, due to the unique structure of its floral morphology. Catasetum cotylicheilum is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements in cultivation."
