It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flower clusters that appear in spring, adding a vibrant touch to its foliage. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that turn brown as they mature. Caesalpinia glauca is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun."
