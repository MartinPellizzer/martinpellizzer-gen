It is characterized by its clusters of small, showy red berries that mature in the fall. The plant belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is known for its aromatic, resinous leaves that emit a strong scent when crushed. Its berries are edible when fully ripe but are toxic when unripe, containing high levels of cyanogenic glycosides. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
