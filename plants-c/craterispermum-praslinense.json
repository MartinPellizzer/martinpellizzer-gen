    "intro": "Craterispermum praslinense, commonly known as the Praslin Island cactus, is a unique succulent native to the Seychelles. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and spiny, paddle-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
