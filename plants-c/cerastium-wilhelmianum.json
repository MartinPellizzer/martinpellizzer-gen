It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance.
