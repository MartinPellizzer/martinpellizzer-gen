It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its showy, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has opposite, simple leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it suitable for gardens in temperate climates. The subspecies is distinguished by its three-flowered clusters, which set it apart from other members of the Chionanthus genus."
