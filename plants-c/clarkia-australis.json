It is a member of the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in coastal dunes and sandy soils, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Clarkia australis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing coastal habitats."
