    "intro": "Cyrtodeira fulgida, commonly known as the golden spider orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features vibrant yellow petals and sepals that resemble spider-like structures, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation and study."
