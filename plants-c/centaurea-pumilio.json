    "intro": "Centaurea pumilio, commonly known as the alpine penny-cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with small, bright yellow flowers surrounded by pale blue to purple bracts. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands. Centaurea pumilio is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
