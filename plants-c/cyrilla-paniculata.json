    "intro": "Cyrilla paniculata, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features simple, alternate, elliptic to ovate leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in panicles during the spring, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries in the fall. Cyrilla paniculata is adapted to wetland environments and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in wetland ecosystems."
