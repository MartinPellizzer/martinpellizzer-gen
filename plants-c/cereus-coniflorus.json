    "intro": "Cereus coniflorus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and ability to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The flowers typically last only one night, making it a rare and beautiful sight in the desert."
