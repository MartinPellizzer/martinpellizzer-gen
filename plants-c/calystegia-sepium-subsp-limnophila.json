    "intro": "Calystegia sepium subsp. limnophila, commonly known as water bindweed, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers with a distinctive spurred shape, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its tuberous roots allow it to survive in waterlogged soils and can make it invasive in certain environments. It plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing food for various insects."
