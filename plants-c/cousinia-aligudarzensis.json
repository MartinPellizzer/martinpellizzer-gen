    "intro": "Cousinia aligudarzensis, commonly known as the Kashmir carnation, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of Pakistan and India. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and has a compact, bushy growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Cousinia aligudarzensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
