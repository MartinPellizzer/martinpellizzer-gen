    "intro": "Cereus zizkaanus, commonly known as the Zizka's cactus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a columnar cactus with a ribbed stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-draining soil and minimal water. Its unique morphology and nocturnal blooming make it a striking and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
