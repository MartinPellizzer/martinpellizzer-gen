It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in brackish or freshwater marshes and is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding. Cladium mariscus var. martii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
