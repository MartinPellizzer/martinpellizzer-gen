    "intro": "Cecropia bullata, commonly known as the giant water willow, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, hollow stems that often contain water. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with ants, which reside in the hollow stems and protect the tree from herbivores. Its rapid growth rate makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects. The plant also plays a role in providing habitat for various insect and bird species."
