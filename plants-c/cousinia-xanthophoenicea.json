    "intro": "Cousinia xanthophoenicea, commonly known as the yellow sand saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight in harsh environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to extreme drought conditions. Cousinia xanthophoenicea plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and is of interest for its ornamental value and ecological resilience."
