    "intro": "Cardamine holmgrenii, commonly known as the Holmgren's watercress, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the moist, shaded environments of eastern North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating on the surface of water, aiding in its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. Its small, white flowers are typically arranged in a raceme and bloom in early spring. Cardamine holmgrenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity in wetland ecosystems."
