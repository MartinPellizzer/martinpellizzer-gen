    "intro": "Cypripedium micranthum, commonly known as the small-flowered lady's slipper, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive slipper-shaped flower. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has a short, rhizomatous root system. Its flowers are usually pale pink to white with a deep pouch-like lip, and it produces showy, fragrant blooms in late spring. Cypripedium micranthum is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and over-collection."
