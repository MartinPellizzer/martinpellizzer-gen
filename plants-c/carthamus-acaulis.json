    "intro": "Carthamus acaulis, commonly known as the naked stem sunflower, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem that is often leafless above the base. The plant produces striking yellow to orange ray florets surrounded by a series of disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Carthamus acaulis thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for dry garden environments."
