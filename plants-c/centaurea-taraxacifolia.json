    "intro": "Centaurea taraxacifolia, commonly known as the dandelion-centaurea, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces achenes with pappus, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, sharing features with other members such as dandelions and thistles."
