    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna var. semperflorens, commonly known as the everflowering hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom throughout the growing season, often multiple times. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Its ornamental value comes from its persistent flowers and foliage, making it a popular choice for gardens."
