    "intro": "Clinopodium axillare subsp. axillare, commonly known as creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped with a strong, aromatic scent. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. It is widely used in horticulture for its ornamental value and as a ground cover, and it also has a long history of use in traditional medicine."
