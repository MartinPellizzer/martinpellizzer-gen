    "intro": "Carex rostrata var. brunnescens, commonly known as the brownish bristle sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil in wetland environments. The varietal name \"brunnescens\" refers to its brownish coloration, particularly in the bracts and flowering structures."
