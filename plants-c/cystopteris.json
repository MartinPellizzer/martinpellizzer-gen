    "intro": "Cystopteris, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, feathery fronds and are often found in moist, shaded environments. Cystopteris species typically have a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow them to spread across the forest floor. Their spore-producing structures, called sori, are usually clustered on the underside of the fronds. The genus includes several species, some of which are popular in horticulture due to their ornamental appeal."
