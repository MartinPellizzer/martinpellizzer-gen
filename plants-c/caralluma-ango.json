    "intro": "Caralluma ango, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshade plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. Its leaves are typically small and scale-like, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Caralluma ango is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though scientific validation remains limited."
