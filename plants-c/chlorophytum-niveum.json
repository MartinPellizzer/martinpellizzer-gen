    "intro": "Chlorophytum niveum, commonly known as the snake plant, is a member of the Asparagaceae family. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped leaves that are usually a vibrant green with white or silver markings. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and requires minimal watering, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, which helps it store water and survive in arid environments. Chlorophytum niveum is also noted for its air-purifying properties, improving indoor air quality."
