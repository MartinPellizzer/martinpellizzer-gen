It is characterized by its striking, crinkled leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which bloom during the warmer months. Cyrtandra crispa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for horticultural collections in tropical and subtropical regions."
