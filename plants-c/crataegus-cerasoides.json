    "intro": "Crataegus cerasoides, commonly known as the small-fruited hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red or orange berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and dry habitats."
