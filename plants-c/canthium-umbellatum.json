    "intro": "Canthium umbellatum, commonly known as the yellow woodbine, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands and marshes of the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Canthium umbellatum is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to moist, swampy environments."
