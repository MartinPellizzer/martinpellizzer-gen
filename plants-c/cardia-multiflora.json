    "intro": "Cardia multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered cardia, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
