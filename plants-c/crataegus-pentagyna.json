    "intro": "Crataegus pentagyna, commonly known as the five-lobed hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically five-lobed, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red berries in the fall. Its bark is usually smooth and grayish, with shallow furrows as it matures. Crataegus pentagyna is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
