    "intro": "Cedrela velutina, commonly known as velvetwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and large, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cedrela velutina is valued for its durable, heavy wood, which has been historically used in furniture and construction."
