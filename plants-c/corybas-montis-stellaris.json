    "intro": "Corybas montis-stellaris, commonly known as the star mountain caladium, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of New Guinea, where it thrives in cool, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped leaves that display a range of colors from deep red to bright green. Its flowers, though small, are highly specialized, featuring a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
