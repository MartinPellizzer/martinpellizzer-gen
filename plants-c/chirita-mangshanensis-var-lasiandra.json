    "intro": "Chirita mangshanensis var. lasiandra, commonly known as the Mangshan hairy chireta, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive hairy leaves and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a velvety texture, while its flowers are usually pink or purple. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
