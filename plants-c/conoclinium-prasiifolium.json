It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy green leaves and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are edible for birds and some small mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Its botanical features make it an attractive addition to native gardens and ecological landscapes."
