    "intro": "Carex pumila subsp. littorea, commonly known as the coastal sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of North America. It typically forms dense clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in dune environments or along the edges of tidal marshes. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and periodic flooding makes it an important stabilizer of coastal ecosystems. The small, spike-like inflorescences produce wind-pollinated flowers, contributing to its ecological role in coastal habitats."
