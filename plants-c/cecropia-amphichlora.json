It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, three-lobed fruits containing several seeds. Cecropia amphichlora is often found in disturbed habitats and is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for various animals."
