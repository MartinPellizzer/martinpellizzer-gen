    "intro": "Cerastium album, commonly known as white mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, white flowers and hairy, succulent leaves. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its stems are often prostrate, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil. Cerastium album is noted for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
