It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features tall, slender stems covered in fine hairs, with lance-shaped leaves that are often gray-green in color. Its showy yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Corvisartia helenium is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting local ecosystems."
