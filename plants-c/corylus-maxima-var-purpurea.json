    "intro": "Corylus maxima var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple husk hazel, is a striking variant of the hazel tree native to Europe. This deciduous shrub or small tree is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that turn a vibrant purple-red in the fall. The flowers are catkins, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and the fruit is a spiny nut enclosed in a thick, purple husk. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and seasonal color changes."
