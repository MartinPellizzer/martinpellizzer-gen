    "intro": "Chloris tetrameris, commonly known as the four-row grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and along coastal areas. Chloris tetrameris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
