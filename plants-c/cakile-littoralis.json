    "intro": "Cakile littoralis, commonly known as sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by capsules containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are pinnately divided and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Cakile littoralis is adapted to saline and wind-swept environments, making it a hardy member of the Brassicaceae family."
