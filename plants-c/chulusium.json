It is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night and close during the day. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and has smooth, dark green leaves with a velvety texture. Its flowers emit a strong, sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Chulusium is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its unique blooming behavior."
