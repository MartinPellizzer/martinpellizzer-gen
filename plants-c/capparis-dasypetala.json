    "intro": "Capparis dasypetala, commonly known as the rough-petaled caper, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with woody stems and dense, often thorny foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, followed by edible, acidic fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in a rough, hairy texture. Capparis dasypetala is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in coastal areas and dry woodlands."
