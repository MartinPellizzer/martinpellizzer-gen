    "intro": "Clidemia biformis, commonly known as the two-lobed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It grows on the branches of host trees, such as mahogany and ceiba, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which can stick to birds and be dispersed to new hosts. Clidemia biformis plays a role in local ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing food for certain insect species."
