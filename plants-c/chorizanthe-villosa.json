    "intro": "Chorizanthe villosa, commonly known as the hairy choris, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its foliage is typically covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh native habitat."
