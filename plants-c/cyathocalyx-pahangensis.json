    "intro": "Cyathocalyx pahangensis, commonly known as the Pahang calyx plant, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its unique calyx structure, which is modified into a cup-like shape that encloses the flower. It typically grows in tropical rainforests and is often found in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
