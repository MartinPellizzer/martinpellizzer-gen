    "intro": "Chrysothamnus nauseosus var. petrophilus, commonly known as the rock goldenbush, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellowish-green foliage and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping. The variety petrophilus is distinguished by its adaptation to limestone-rich soils and its ability to flourish in harsh, rocky habitats."
