    "intro": "Celastrus aphyllus, commonly known as the leafless bindweed, is a climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its lack of true leaves, with instead modified stems that perform photosynthesis. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
