    "intro": "Carex breviculmis var. puberula, commonly known as the hairy short-bracted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its small, spike-like inflorescences bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, and it produces small, three-angled berries. This variety is distinguished by its pubescent (hairy) surfaces, particularly on the leaves and stems, which give it its common name."
