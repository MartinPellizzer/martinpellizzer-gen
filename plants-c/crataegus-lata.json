    "intro": "Crataegus lata, commonly known as the Canadian hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters, featuring thorny branches and clusters of white to pinkish flowers in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges, and it has a shallow root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Crataegus lata is often found in open woodlands, along stream banks, and in disturbed sites."
