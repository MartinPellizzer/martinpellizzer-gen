    "intro": "Cephalanthera floribunda, commonly known as the showy yellow twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a terrestrial herb that typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and meadows. The plant is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which are arranged in a dense, spike-like cluster at the top of the stem. Its roots contain specialized structures called mycorrhizal associations, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil. Cephalanthera floribunda is also known for its fragrant scent, which attracts pollinators such as bees and flies."
