    "intro": "Cyperus ochraceus var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf spikerush, is a low-growing perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically forms dense clumps with slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish or brownish in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are usually wind-pollinated. It thrives in wet or moist soils, making it a common species in marshy areas and along waterways. Its compact size and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for wetland gardens and ecological restoration projects."
