    "intro": "Cyanostegia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved blue stem, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, blue-gray pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
