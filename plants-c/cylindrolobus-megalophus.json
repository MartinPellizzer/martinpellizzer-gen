It typically grows on bark and stone in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. The plant has a distinctive cylindrical shape, with a central axis and lateral lobes that give it its common name. Its chemical composition includes various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role. This lichen is an important indicator species for assessing air quality and ecosystem health."
