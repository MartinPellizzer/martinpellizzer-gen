It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within tropical forests. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
