    "intro": "Cyanea maritae, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Cyanea maritae plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
