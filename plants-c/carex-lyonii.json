    "intro": "Carex lyonii, commonly known as Lyon's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. Lyon's sedge typically grows in wet or moist environments such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually green or brown, and it thrives in full to partial sunlight. The plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
