    "intro": "Campanula trachelium var. albiflora, commonly known as the white bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and grow in a basal rosette. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
