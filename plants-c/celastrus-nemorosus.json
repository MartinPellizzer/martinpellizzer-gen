    "intro": "Celastrus nemorosus, commonly known as the European staff-vine, is a deciduous climbing shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain birds. Celastrus nemorosus thrives in woodland habitats and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
