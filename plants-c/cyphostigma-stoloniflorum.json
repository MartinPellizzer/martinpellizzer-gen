    "intro": "Cyphostigma stoloniflorum, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features erect, branched stems covered in a dense layer of silvery-white hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically purple or blue in color, which bloom in the late afternoon. Its leaves are ovate and have a distinctive waxy coating, contributing to its drought tolerance. Cyphostigma stoloniflorum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
