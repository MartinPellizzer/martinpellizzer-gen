    "intro": "Coniogramme americana, commonly known as the American fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
