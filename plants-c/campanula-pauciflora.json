    "intro": "Campanula pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered bellflower, is a perennial plant belonging to the Campanulaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. Campanula pauciflora is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
