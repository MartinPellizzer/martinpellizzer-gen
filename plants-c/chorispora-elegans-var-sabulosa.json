    "intro": "Chorispora elegans var. sabulosa, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland deserts. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
