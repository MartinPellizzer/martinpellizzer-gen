It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant produces yellow daisy-like flowers that bloom in spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its narrow, lance-shaped leaves are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature.
