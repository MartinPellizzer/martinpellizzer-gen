    "intro": "Cistanche deserticola var. flabellata, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic plant native to arid regions of Asia. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients, typically growing on species of the genus Haloxylon. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers and has a fleshy, branched stem covered in small, scale-like leaves. It is adapted to extreme desert conditions with deep root systems that can penetrate host plants. This species is also valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
