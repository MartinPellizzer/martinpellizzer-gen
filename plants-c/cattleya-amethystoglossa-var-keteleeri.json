    "intro": "Cattleya amethystoglossa var. keteleeri, commonly known as the Keteleeri Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple and white, with a distinctive amethyst-colored lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants rather than in soil. It thrives in high humidity and bright, indirect light, making it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts. Its fragrant blooms and vibrant colors make it a prized addition to both indoor and outdoor gardens."
