    "intro": "Cuscuta tetrandra, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow flowers and has thread-like stems that wrap around its host to extract water and nutrients. The plant is native to various regions in the Americas and is often found on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to spread widely. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or damage its host plants, making it a concern in agricultural settings."
