It features compact, rosette-shaped foliage with fleshy, bluish-green leaves that have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
