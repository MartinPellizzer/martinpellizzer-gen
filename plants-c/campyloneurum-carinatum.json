    "intro": "Campyloneurum carinatum, commonly known as the ridge-leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often ridged fronds that give it its common name. Native to tropical regions of Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a compact growth habit with rhizomes that spread horizontally, supporting its dense foliage. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
