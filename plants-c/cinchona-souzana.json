    "intro": "Cinchona souzana, commonly known as the Portuguese quinine tree, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces red or orange berries that contain the seeds, and its bark has historically been a source of quinine, used in the treatment of malaria. Cinchona souzana typically grows in humid, shaded environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Its ornamental value has also made it a popular choice for botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
