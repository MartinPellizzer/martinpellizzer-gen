It features small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valued addition to gardens with limited space."
