It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and other tropical plants. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
