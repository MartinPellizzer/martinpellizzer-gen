    "intro": "Cryptantha aprica, commonly known as the yellow globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its yellow, globular flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Cryptantha aprica is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and its ecological importance to native pollinators."
