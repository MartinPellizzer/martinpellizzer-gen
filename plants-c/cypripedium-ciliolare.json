    "intro": "Cypripedium ciliolare, commonly known as the ciliate lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch that resembles a lady's shoe. The plant typically grows in cool, moist forest habitats, often in shaded and humus-rich soils. Its botanical features include a single, erect stem with a few broad, lance-shaped leaves. The flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are primarily pink or white with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects."
