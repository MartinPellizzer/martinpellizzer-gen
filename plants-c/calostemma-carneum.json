    "intro": "Calostemma carneum, commonly known as the red lily or red lily-of-the-valley, is a striking bulbous perennial native to southern Africa. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red, often with a contrasting throat. The plant produces a single, erect stem with few leaves, and its flowers are typically borne in clusters at the top. Calostemma carneum thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements have made it a favored ornamental plant in many regions."
