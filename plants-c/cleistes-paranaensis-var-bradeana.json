It is characterized by its small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it thrives in shaded, humid environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
