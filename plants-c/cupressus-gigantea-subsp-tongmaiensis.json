    "intro": "Cupressus gigantea subsp. tongmaiensis, commonly known as the Tongmaiensis Chinese fir, is a rare and relict species native to China. It is characterized by its conical shape, dark reddish-brown bark, and scale-like leaves arranged in crossed pairs. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain winged seeds, typical of the Cupressaceae family. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
