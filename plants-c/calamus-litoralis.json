    "intro": "Calamus litoralis, commonly known as the coastal calamus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae. It is native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. This plant is characterized by its tall, slender stem and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. It thrives in moist, sandy soils near the shoreline and is adapted to salt spray and tidal influences. Calamus litoralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms."
