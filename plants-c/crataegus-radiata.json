    "intro": "Crataegus radiata, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries known as haws, which are edible but typically consumed by birds and animals. Crataegus radiata is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and along roadsides, and it plays an important role in supporting local wildlife."
