    "intro": "Cacalia parasitica, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the stems of its host plants. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Cacalia parasitica is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing on trees in dense vegetation."
