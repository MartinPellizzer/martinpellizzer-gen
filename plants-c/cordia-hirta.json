It is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. Cordia hirta is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline environments. It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
