    "intro": "Copiapoa desertorum var. hornilloensis, commonly known as the Hornillo cactus, is a columnar cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It features a tall, cylindrical stem covered in white, woolly spines that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are pollinated by insects. It is adapted to extreme aridity, storing water in its thick stem and having a shallow root system. This variety is relatively rare and is often found in rocky soils along coastal areas."
