The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in panicles, which are followed by small, round berries that ripen to a dark purple or black color. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in urban landscapes due to its tolerance of pollution and compacted soils. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to different environmental conditions."
