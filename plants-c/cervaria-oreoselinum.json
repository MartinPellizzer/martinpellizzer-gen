    "intro": "Cervaria oreoselinum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth patterns of its host, making it a specialized and often rare component of certain ecosystems. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
