    "intro": "Cola variantifolia, commonly known as the African cola tree, is a member of the Sterculiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its large, glossy, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that develop into hard, woody pods containing caffeine-rich seeds. These seeds are used to make cola nuts, which are a key ingredient in colas and other beverages. The tree is also valued for its ornamental foliage and ecological importance in its native habitat."
