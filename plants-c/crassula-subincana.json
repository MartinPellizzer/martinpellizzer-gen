    "intro": "Crassula subincana, commonly known as the Woolly Crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine, woolly layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the spring or summer. It is often grown as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light. Crassula subincana is well-suited for rock gardens or as part of a succulent collection."
