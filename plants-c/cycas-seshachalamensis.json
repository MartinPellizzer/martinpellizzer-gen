    "intro": "Cycas seshachalamensis, commonly known as the Seshachalam cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Eastern Ghats of India. It is a member of the cycad family, known for its distinctive appearance with a stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with the male cones located at the base of the trunk and the female cones at the top, a characteristic feature of cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often in well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
