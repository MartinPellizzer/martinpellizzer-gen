    "intro": "Cuscuta bracteata, commonly known as the bracted dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to North America and can be found in various habitats, including fields and along roadsides. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause damage to crops and ornamental plants."
