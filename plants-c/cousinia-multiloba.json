    "intro": "Cousinia multiloba, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a perennial herb with a low-growing, mat-forming structure, characterized by its dense cluster of small, yellowish flowers. The plant features hairy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Cousinia multiloba is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh, drought-prone habitats."
