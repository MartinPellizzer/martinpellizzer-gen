    "intro": "Corryocactus heteracanthus, commonly known as the Mexican night-blooming cereus, is a cacti species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and clusters of fragrant white flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a nocturnal flowering habit, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
