    "intro": "Cereus subulifer, commonly known as the needle cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a spiny, columnar cactus that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features sharp, needle-like spines and produces white or pale pink flowers at the tips of its stems. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water. This cactus is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established."
