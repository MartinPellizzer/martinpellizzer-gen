    "intro": "Clematis microphylla var. normalis, commonly known as the small-leaved clematis, is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer, usually in shades of white, pink, or purple. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for climbing structures or trellises. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking to add vertical interest to their landscapes."
