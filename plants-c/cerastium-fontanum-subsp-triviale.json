    "intro": "Cerastium fontanum subsp. triviale, commonly known as the common mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of white, five-petaled flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a common sight in temperate regions and a useful plant for ecological studies."
