    "intro": "Carex distans var. bessarabica, commonly known as the Bessarabian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. This variety is native to Eastern Europe and parts of Russia, often found in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
