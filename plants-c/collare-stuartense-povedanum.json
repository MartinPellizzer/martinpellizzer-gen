    "intro": "Collare-stuartense povedanum, commonly known as the Stuart's collar orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its unique, intricate flower structure with a prominent, hood-like labellum. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates and requires specific microclimatic conditions to thrive. Its botanical features include narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a short, erect stem. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically important for conservation efforts in its native region."
