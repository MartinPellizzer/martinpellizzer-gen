    "intro": "Cylindrokelupha turgida, commonly known as the swollen-fruit cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, cylindrical trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces distinctive, thick, woody cones that are adapted to dry environments, and its reproductive structures are highly specialized for wind pollination. Native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, it thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soils. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
