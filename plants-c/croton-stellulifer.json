    "intro": "Croton stellulifer, commonly known as the star-leaf croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often adorned with small, star-like protrusions along the veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
