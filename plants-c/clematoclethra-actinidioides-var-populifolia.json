    "intro": "Clematoclethra actinidioides var. populifolia, commonly known as the Japanese arrow bamboo, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features slender, arching stems that resemble bamboo, with small, heart-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique foliage and seasonal color changes."
