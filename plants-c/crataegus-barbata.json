    "intro": "Crataegus barbata, commonly known as the barbed hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces white or pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and mammals. Crataegus barbata is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks, thriving in well-drained soils. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in native plant landscapes."
