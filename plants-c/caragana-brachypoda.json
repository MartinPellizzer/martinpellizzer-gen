    "intro": "Caragana brachypoda, commonly known as the dwarf shrub bitterbrush, is a deciduous shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, compound leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, woody fruits that contain seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and the ability to thrive in poor soils. Caragana brachypoda plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for wildlife."
