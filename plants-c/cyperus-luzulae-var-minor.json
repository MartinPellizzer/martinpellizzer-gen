    "intro": "Cyperus luzulae var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf sedgeland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, exhibiting a compact growth habit with slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often subtended by bracts, a characteristic feature of the Cyperaceae family. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
