    "intro": "Cypholophus nummularis, commonly known as the silver dollar plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, silver-gray leaves that are oval in shape, resembling small silver coins. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
