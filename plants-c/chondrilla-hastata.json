    "intro": "Chondrilla hastata, commonly known as the prairie sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Chondrilla hastata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
