    "intro": "Clematoclethra scandens, commonly known as the climbing clematoclethra, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems that allow it to climb and form dense thickets. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slight serration along the edges. Clematoclethra scandens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and floral display, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
