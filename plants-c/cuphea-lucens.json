    "intro": "Cuphea lucens, commonly known as the flame flower, is a tropical shrub native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Cuphea lucens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant appearance and ability to attract pollinators like hummingbirds."
