    "intro": "Chilita grahamii, commonly known as Graham's chilita, is a rare flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chilita grahamii is considered a species of conservation concern."
