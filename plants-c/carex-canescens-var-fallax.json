    "intro": "Carex canescens var. fallax, commonly known as the fallax sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the northeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually grayish-green in color, and it produces spikes of small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer. It is often found in association with other wetland plants and plays a role in stabilizing soil in these environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
