    "intro": "Cymbalaria microcalyx subsp. acutiloba, commonly known as the sharp-leaved figwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Scrophulariaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and distinctive heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of tubular, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to southern Europe and western Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its ornamental value and ability to spread via runners make it a common weed in disturbed habitats."
