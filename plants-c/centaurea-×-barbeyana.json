    "intro": "Centaurea \u00d7 barbeyana, commonly known as the hybrid cornflower, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a cross between Centaurea cyanus (blue cornflower) and Centaurea solstitialis (yellow starthistle), resulting in a plant with a mix of characteristics from both parents. The species is known for its striking blue to purple flower heads, which are often surrounded by bracts that resemble a crown. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in gardens and public landscapes."
