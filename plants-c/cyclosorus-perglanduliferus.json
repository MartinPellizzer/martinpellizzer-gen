    "intro": "Cyclosorus perglanduliferus, commonly known as the glandular cyclosorus, is a rare and lesser-known species of liverwort. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its intricate, leaf-like structures that form dense, mat-like growths. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with specialized glands that secrete substances, possibly for protection or nutrient absorption. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
