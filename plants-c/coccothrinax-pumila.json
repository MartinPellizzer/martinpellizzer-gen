It is characterized by its short, sturdy trunk and clustered, fan-shaped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to salty air and sandy soils. It produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into round, fuzzy fruits. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
