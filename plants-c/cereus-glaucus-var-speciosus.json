    "intro": "Cereus glaucus var. speciosus, commonly known as the showy night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in white, woolly hairs. The plant produces striking, white, funnel-shaped flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water once established."
