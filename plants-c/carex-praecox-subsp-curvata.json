    "intro": "Carex praecox subsp. curvata, commonly known as the early sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features grass-like leaves that are usually narrow and slightly curved, giving it its subspecific name. Its flowering spikes consist of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Carex praecox subsp. curvata plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
