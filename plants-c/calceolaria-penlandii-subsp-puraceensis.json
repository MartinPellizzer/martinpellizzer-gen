    "intro": "Calceolaria penlandii subsp. puraceensis, commonly known as the Purace Mountain slipper orchid, is a rare and specialized plant native to the high-altitude regions of western Colombia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically purple or violet in color. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in cloud forests at elevations above 2,500 meters. Its morphology includes hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, adapted to withstand the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
