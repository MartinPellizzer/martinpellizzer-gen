    "intro": "Crassula nodulosa var. nodulosa, commonly known as the Jade Plant or Crassula ovata, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slight reddish tinge under direct sunlight. The plant produces small, star-shaped white flowers during the summer months. It is a compact shrub that can grow up to 1 meter tall, often forming a dense, bushy structure. Due to its ability to store water in its leaves, it is highly drought-tolerant and well-suited for arid environments."
