    "intro": "Cocos elegantissima, commonly known as the elegant coconut palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces coconuts that are typically smaller and more ornamental than those of the common coconut palm. It thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. Due to its aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a landscape plant."
