    "intro": "Chaenactis gracilenta, commonly known as the slenderleaf biscuitbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a low, sprawling growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer."
