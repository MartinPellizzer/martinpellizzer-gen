    "intro": "Colchicum pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean colchic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers in late summer, which are borne on tall, slender stems. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and often withering by the time the flowers appear. Colchicum pyrenaicum is part of the Colchicaceae family and is notable for its ornamental value and ecological significance in its native habitat."
