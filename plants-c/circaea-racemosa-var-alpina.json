    "intro": "Circaea racemosa var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and well-drained soils, often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in harsh environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
