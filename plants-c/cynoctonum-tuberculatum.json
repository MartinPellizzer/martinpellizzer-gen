    "intro": "Cynoctonum tuberculatum, commonly known as the roughleaf cycad, is a species of cycad native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, compound leaves with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, cone-like structures. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires ample sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth rate, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
