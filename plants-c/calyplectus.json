    "intro": "Calyplectus, commonly known as the bottlebrush plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Scrophulariaceae. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which resembles a bottlebrush due to its dense clusters of tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with woody stems and opposite leaves. Calyplectus species are native to regions of southern Africa and are often found in rocky or arid habitats. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their striking floral displays."
