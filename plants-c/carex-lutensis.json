It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, rushes, and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in moist or waterlogged soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are grass-like, with a triangular cross-section, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes. Carex lutensis plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
