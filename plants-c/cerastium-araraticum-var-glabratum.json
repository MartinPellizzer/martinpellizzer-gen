    "intro": "Cerastium araraticum var. glabratum, commonly known as the smooth mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, though the 'glabratum' variety is notable for its reduced hair coverage. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a common sight in moist, temperate regions where it contributes to the understory vegetation."
