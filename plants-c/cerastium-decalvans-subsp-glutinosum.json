    "intro": "Cerastium decalvans subsp. glutinosum, commonly known as sticky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes or rocky habitats. The plant features prostrate stems covered with glandular hairs that produce a sticky secretion, giving it its common name. Its small, white or pinkish flowers appear in clusters, and the leaves are usually linear and covered with a fine, waxy coating. This subspecies is adapted to harsh environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience."
