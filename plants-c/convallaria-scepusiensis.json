    "intro": "Convallaria scepusiensis, commonly known as the Scepusian lily, is a rare and endemic plant species native to a limited geographic region. It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
