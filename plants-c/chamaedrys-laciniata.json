It features small, oval leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery or grayish pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it can be invasive in some regions if not properly managed."
