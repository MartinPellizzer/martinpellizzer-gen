    "intro": "Carex mukdenensis, commonly known as Mukden sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Mukden sedge is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
