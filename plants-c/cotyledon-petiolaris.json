    "intro": "Cotyledon petiolaris, commonly known as the coral cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed leaves that are typically green with red or purple edges, which help it store water and perform photosynthesis efficiently. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Cotyledon petiolaris thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments."
