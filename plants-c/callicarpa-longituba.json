    "intro": "Callicarpa longituba, commonly known as the long-tube beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, oval-shaped leaves and its striking, vibrant purple berries that appear in late summer. The plant's flowers are typically pale green to pink and are borne in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The berries are edible for humans but are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
