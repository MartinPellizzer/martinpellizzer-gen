    "intro": "Ctenitis wacketii, commonly known as the Wackett's sea holly, is a rare and unique species of flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features robust, succulent leaves with a waxy coating, adapted to withstand the harsh coastal environment. Its flowers are typically blue or purple, arranged in dense, spherical clusters that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Ctenitis wacketii is considered a vulnerable species."
