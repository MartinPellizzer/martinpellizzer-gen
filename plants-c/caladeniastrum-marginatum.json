    "intro": "Caladeniastrum marginatum, commonly known as the Narrow-leafed Spider-orchid, is an orchid species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its striking, spider-like flowers that are typically pale yellow with red or brown markings. The plant produces a single, erect flowering stem that bears several small, delicate orchid flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Caladeniastrum marginatum is a protected species due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss."
