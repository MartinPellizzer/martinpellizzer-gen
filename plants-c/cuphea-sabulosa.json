    "intro": "Cuphea sabulosa, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant has hairy, succulent-like leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Cuphea sabulosa is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
