    "intro": "Crucifera bulbifera, commonly known as the bulb-bearing crucifer, is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers. This plant produces unique bulb-like structures that serve as modified stems, often containing nutrients for propagation. Its leaves are typically lobed or toothed, with a rough texture, and it thrives in temperate climates. The plant is known for its ability to store water in its bulbs, aiding in survival during dry periods. It is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
