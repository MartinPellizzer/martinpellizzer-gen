    "intro": "Ceratophyllum muricatum subsp. kossinskyi, commonly known as the spiny watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to South America. It has whorled leaves that are serrated and often covered in small spines, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is characterized by its branching structure and the presence of small, white flowers that appear in late summer. It thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes and slow-moving rivers. Its rapid growth and dense foliage make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems, though it can also become invasive in certain regions."
