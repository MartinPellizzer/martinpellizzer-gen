    "intro": "Cenchrus mitis, commonly known as sand couch grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread aggressively, often forming dense mats in disturbed soils."
