    "intro": "Centaurea alba subsp. brunnea, commonly known as the pale centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in summer. The subspecies brunnea differs from the typical Centaurea alba by having darker, more reddish-brown flower bracts. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. This plant is often found in Mediterranean climates and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
