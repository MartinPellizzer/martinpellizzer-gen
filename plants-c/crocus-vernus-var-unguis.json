    "intro": "Crocus vernus var. unguis, commonly known as the violet crocus, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It produces showy, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive, rounded shape that resembles a small boot, hence its botanical name. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often as early as February, making it one of the first crocuses to appear. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it prefers well-drained, slightly alkaline soils. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its early spring display."
