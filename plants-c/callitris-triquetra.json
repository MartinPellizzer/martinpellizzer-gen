    "intro": "Callitris triquetra, commonly known as the triquetra cedar, is a species of conifer native to Australia. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and is typically found in coastal and heathland environments. The plant produces cones that contain both male and female reproductive structures, typical of conifers. Its bark is thick and fibrous, providing some resistance to fire and drought. The triquetra cedar plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting various wildlife species."
