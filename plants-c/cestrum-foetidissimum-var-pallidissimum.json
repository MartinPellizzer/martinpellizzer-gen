    "intro": "Cestrum foetidissimum var. pallidissimum, commonly known as the pale stinkwood, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its strong, unpleasant odor, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant despite its pungent scent."
