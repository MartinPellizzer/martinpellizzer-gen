It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, trifoliate leaves that are often mistaken for those of other similar species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Centaurea triniifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
