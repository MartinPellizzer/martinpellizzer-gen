    "intro": "Cardamine sylvatica, commonly known as the forest buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks, preferring rich, loamy soils. The plant features a basal rosette of heart-shaped, doubly-lobed leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in early spring. Its flowers are clustered in a raceme and are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady garden settings."
