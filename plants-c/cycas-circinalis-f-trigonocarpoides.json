    "intro": "Cycas circinalis f. trigonocarpoides, commonly known as the Trigonocarpoides cycad, is a rare variant of the cycad species characterized by its distinctive three-lobed seed cones. This plant is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are pinnately compound, featuring a feathery appearance with numerous narrow, glossy leaflets. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
