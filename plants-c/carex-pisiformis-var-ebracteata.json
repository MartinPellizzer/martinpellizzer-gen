    "intro": "Carex pisiformis var. ebracteata, commonly known as the broad-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wetlands, and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are broad and flat, with a distinctive bluish-green color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
