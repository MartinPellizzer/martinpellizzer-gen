    "intro": "Ctenopteris longiuscula, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that helps it anchor and spread in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, elongated shape that gives it its common name. Ctenopteris longiuscula thrives in humid climates and is often found in rainforests and along stream banks."
