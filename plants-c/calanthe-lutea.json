    "intro": "Calanthe lutea, commonly known as the yellow calanthe, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich substrates. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies in its natural habitat. Calanthe lutea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
