    "intro": "Chirita macrophylla subsp. tirapensis, commonly known as the Tirap chirita, is a perennial herb native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the warm season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
