    "intro": "Clidemia fluminensis, commonly known as the Florida morning glory, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas and wetlands. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
