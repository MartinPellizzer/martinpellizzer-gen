    "intro": "Ceropegia punctata var. framesii, commonly known as the String of Hearts, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, attracting pollinators like moths and bees. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
