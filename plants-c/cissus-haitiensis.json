    "intro": "Cissus haitiensis, commonly known as Haitian devil's ivy, is a climbing vine native to the Caribbean, particularly Haiti. It is characterized by its trailing stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by translucent, waxy fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found growing on rocks or trees in its natural habitat. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in tropical gardens."
