    "intro": "Calophyllum woodii, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, orange-colored fruits that contain seeds. Calophyllum woodii is valued for its durable, aromatic timber, which is used in furniture and cabinetry. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
