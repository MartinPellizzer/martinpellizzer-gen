    "intro": "Cyclotaxis, commonly known as the spiral arrangement of leaves or flowers around a stem, is a botanical phenomenon observed in certain plant species. This arrangement follows a logarithmic spiral, which allows for optimal exposure to sunlight and efficient space utilization. It is most commonly seen in plants like sunflowers, daisies, and some species of grasses. The pattern is governed by the Fibonacci sequence, which contributes to its mathematical elegance. This structural adaptation enhances the plant's growth and survival in natural environments."
