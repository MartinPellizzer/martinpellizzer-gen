    "intro": "Celastrus glaber, commonly known as the smooth staffvetch, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia and the United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring slender, often branched stems covered in smooth, grayish bark. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red berries that attract various bird species. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and oval-shaped with a smooth margin. Celastrus glaber is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
