    "intro": "Coelogyne floresensis, commonly known as the Flores orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Indonesian island of Flores. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its erect, leafy stems and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The plant typically blooms in late winter to early spring, producing pale yellow to orange-red flowers with a distinctive lip. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies in its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
