    "intro": "Carduus nutans subsp. scabrisquamus, commonly known as the roughleaf thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and wastelands. Its leaves are covered in a rough, sandpapery texture, which gives it its subspecies name. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
