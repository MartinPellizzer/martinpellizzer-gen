    "intro": "Chrysophyllum barbasco, commonly known as the wild cocoa tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces smooth, oval fruits that contain a single seed surrounded by a sticky, aromatic pulp. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a source of natural compounds used in traditional medicine and as a relative of the cacao plant."
