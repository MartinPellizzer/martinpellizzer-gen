    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 southgatense, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium \u00d7 morganianum. It is a herbaceous perennial with a distinctive, showy flower that resembles a slipper, typically pink or white in color. The plant has a long, fleshy rhizome and produces a single, large, pouch-shaped lip that is a key feature of the genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is also considered a rare and protected species in the wild."
