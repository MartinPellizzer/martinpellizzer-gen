    "intro": "Carex canina subsp. collifera, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in three ranks, a characteristic feature of the Carex genus. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like structure bearing small, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays an important ecological role in wetland habitats by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
