    "intro": "Carex melanantha f. pallida, commonly known as the pale form of the black sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is distinguished by its pale green to almost white foliage, setting it apart from the typical darker form of Carex melanantha."
