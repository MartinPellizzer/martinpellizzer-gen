    "intro": "Cantinoa erythrostachys, commonly known as the red-stemmed chamaedorea, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Central and South America. It features a slender, upright stem with a reddish hue, which becomes more pronounced as the plant matures. The leaves are typically elongated, leathery, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by dark, spherical berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental foliage plant."
