    "intro": "Cerastium glutinosum var. alpestre, commonly known as alpine sticky chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, hairy, sticky leaves and produces white or pale pink flowers with five petals. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. It is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes. Its sticky secretions on the leaves help reduce water loss and deter herbivores."
