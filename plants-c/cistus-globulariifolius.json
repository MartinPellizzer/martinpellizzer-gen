    "intro": "Cistus globulariifolius, commonly known as the globular-leaf rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has thick, leathery leaves that help it conserve water in its arid habitat. It produces small, woody fruits that contain numerous seeds. Cistus globulariifolius is well adapted to rocky soils and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
