    "intro": "Cyrtospermum trifoliatum, commonly known as the three-leaved bluebell, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors. The plant features trifoliate leaves, meaning each leaf is divided into three leaflets, and produces small, bell-shaped blue or purple flowers. It is part of the Campanulaceae family, which includes many other bell-shaped flowers. Cyrtospermum trifoliatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
