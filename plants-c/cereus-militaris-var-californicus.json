    "intro": "Cereus militaris var. californicus, commonly known as the California night-blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to the western United States. It is a low-growing, spiny plant with a branching structure and thick, ribbed stems. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night and remain open for only one day. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Its unique blooming habit makes it a popular choice for desert gardens and rockeries."
