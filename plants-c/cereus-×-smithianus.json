It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its segmented, branching stems that bear vibrant, showy flowers. The plant typically blooms during the holiday season, producing flowers in shades of red, pink, orange, and white. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
