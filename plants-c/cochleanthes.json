    "intro": "Cochleanthes, commonly known as the orchid genus, consists of flowering plants belonging to the family Orchidaceae. These plants are native to various regions in Africa, particularly in the eastern and southern parts of the continent. Cochleanthes species are typically epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks rather than in soil. They are characterized by their intricate, often fragrant flowers with a variety of colors and shapes. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by horticulturists for its beauty and unique floral structures."
