    "intro": "Clematis tessen, commonly known as the Japanese Clematis, is a deciduous vine native to East Asia. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are typically white or pale blue with five petals. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Clematis tessen is also valued for its ability to climb and cover trellises or walls effectively."
