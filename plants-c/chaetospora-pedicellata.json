    "intro": "Chaetospora pedicellata, commonly known as the coral-like lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive, branched thallus structure. It typically grows on bark, soil, or rock surfaces in moist, shaded environments. The plant's morphology features a dense, velvety upper surface with a network of lobes and a smooth, pale lower surface. It is characterized by its unique reproductive structures, including apothecia with distinct, tooth-like margins. This lichen is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality and environmental conditions."
