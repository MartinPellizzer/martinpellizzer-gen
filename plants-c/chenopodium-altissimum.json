    "intro": "Chenopodium altissimum, commonly known as giant goosefoot, is a tall annual plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its rapid growth and extensive root system, it can become a nuisance in agricultural areas."
