    "intro": "Ctenocladus, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a genus of evergreen shrubs belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, scale-like leaves and their ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Ctenocladus species typically grow in dense mats or low shrub-like forms, often found in temperate regions. They reproduce via spores rather than seeds, a trait that distinguishes them from modern flowering plants. Their ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making them living fossils with significant ecological and evolutionary importance."
