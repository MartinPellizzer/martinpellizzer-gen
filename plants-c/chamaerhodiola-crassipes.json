    "intro": "Chamaerhodiola crassipes, commonly known as the alpine rose or stonecrop, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial herb with a compact, cushion-like growth form that helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers during the short growing season, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are fleshy and covered in a waxy cuticle, which reduces water loss in nutrient-poor soils. Chamaerhodiola crassipes is adapted to low light conditions and can thrive in rocky or gravelly habitats."
