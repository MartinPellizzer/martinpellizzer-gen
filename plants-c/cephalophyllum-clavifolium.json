    "intro": "Cephalophyllum clavifolium, commonly known as the club-leaved candelabra, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive candelabra-like growth habit, with multiple stems emerging from a single base. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a vibrant touch to its natural habitat. Its leaves are narrow and clustered at the base, giving it a compact appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
