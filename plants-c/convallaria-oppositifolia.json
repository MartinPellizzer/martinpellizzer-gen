    "intro": "Convallaria oppositifolia, commonly known as the oppositeleaf lily of the valley, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Convallariaceae. It is characterized by its opposite arrangement of leaves, which gives it its scientific name, and its clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest floors. It produces red berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
