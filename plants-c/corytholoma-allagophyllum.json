    "intro": "Corytholoma allagophyllum, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in rocky, arid environments. It forms a dense, crust-like growth on limestone and sandstone surfaces, often in mountainous regions. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, relying instead on its ability to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. This plant plays a vital role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms."
