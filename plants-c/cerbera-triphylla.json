    "intro": "Cerbera triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaf cerbera, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its simple, trifoliate leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas or near water sources. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care."
