    "intro": "Calamagrostis villosa var. nutans, commonly known as the nodding feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, silver-green leaves and its distinctive, drooping inflorescence that gives it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is also cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
