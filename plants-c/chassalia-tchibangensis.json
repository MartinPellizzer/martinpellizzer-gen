    "intro": "Chassalia tchibangensis, commonly known as the Cameroon chassalia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Due to its restricted habitat and limited research, Chassalia tchibangensis remains a lesser-known but ecologically significant species in its native region."
