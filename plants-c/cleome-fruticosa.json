    "intro": "Cleome fruticosa, commonly known as the \"spider flower,\" is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a shrub-like plant that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring upright stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often resembling spider webs, hence its common name. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its seed pods are cylindrical and split open to release the seeds. Cleome fruticosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
