    "intro": "Cassytha dispar, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through haustoria that attach to the stems of its host plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and is often found growing on a variety of hosts, including shrubs and trees. Its stems are usually yellow or green and can become woody as the plant matures. Cassytha dispar plays a role in ecological systems by influencing host plant growth and providing food for certain insects and animals."
