    "intro": "Crataegus asperata, commonly known as the rough hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to ovate leaves, and small, white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Crataegus asperata is often found in woodland edges, stream banks, and other moist habitats. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential cardiovascular benefits."
