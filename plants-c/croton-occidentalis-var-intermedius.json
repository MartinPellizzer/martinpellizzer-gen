    "intro": "Croton occidentalis var. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate croton, is a tropical shrub native to regions of Southeast Asia. It features large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically green with prominent veins, often displaying a striking yellow or orange hue on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental foliage. Due to its attractive appearance, it is popular in horticulture but requires careful management to prevent invasive spread."
