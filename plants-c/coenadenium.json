    "intro": "Coenadenium, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa and are characterized by their fleshy, thick leaves and showy, tubular flowers. Coenadenium species typically have a rosette growth habit, with leaves arranged in a compact, circular pattern. The flowers come in a variety of colors, including shades of purple, pink, white, and red, making them popular ornamental plants. They thrive in bright, indirect light and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
