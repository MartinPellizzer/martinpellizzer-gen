    "intro": "Cyperus digitatus f. contractior, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Its inflorescence consists of small, clustered spikes that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more compact leaves compared to the typical form of Cyperus digitatus."
