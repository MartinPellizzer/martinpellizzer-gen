    "intro": "Carex angustiutricula, commonly known as narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes. This plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in wetland habitats. Carex angustiutricula is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
