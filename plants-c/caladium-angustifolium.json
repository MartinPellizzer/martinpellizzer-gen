    "intro": "Caladium angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf arrowleaf, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that can be green, red, or variegated in color. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening for its vibrant and unique appearance. Caladium angustifolium is typically grown as an annual in temperate climates due to its sensitivity to frost."
