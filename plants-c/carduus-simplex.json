    "intro": "Carduus simplex, commonly known as the common thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and is often found in disturbed soils, roadsides, and fields. Its leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures that contribute to its defensive mechanisms against herbivores. The flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets, making it a member of the Asteraceae family."
