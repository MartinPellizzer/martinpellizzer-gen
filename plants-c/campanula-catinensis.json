    "intro": "Campanula catinensis, commonly known as the bellflower or mountain bellflower, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Campanula catinensis is noted for its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
