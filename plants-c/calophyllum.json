These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, the Americas, and Asia. Calophyllum species are typically evergreen trees or shrubs, characterized by their smooth, often reddish or yellowish bark and glossy, lance-shaped leaves.

The genus is notable for its aromatic oils and is used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
