    "intro": "Comarostaphylis diversifolia subsp. planifolia, commonly known as the flat-leaf comarostaphylis, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or white, arranged in spikes at the ends of the branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed beyond its native range."
