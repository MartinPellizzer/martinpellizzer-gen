It features dense, scale-like leaves that are dark green and emit a subtle, resinous fragrance. This variety is native to the eastern Mediterranean, particularly in the mountains of Lebanon. It is well adapted to rocky soils and can tolerate drought conditions. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its unique appearance and resilience."
