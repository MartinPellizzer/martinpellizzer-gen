It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant has dark green, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, typically at elevations above 3,000 meters.
