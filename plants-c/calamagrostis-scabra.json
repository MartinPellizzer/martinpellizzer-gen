    "intro": "Calamagrostis scabra, commonly known as rough silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered with fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, fluffy flowers in late summer, which are often used in floral arrangements. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Calamagrostis scabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
