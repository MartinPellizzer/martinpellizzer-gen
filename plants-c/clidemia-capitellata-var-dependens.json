    "intro": "Clidemia capitellata var. dependens, commonly known as the hanging mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, white, clustered flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The leaves are typically opposite, elliptical, and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form thick ground cover."
