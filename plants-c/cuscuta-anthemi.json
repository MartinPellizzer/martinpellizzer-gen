    "intro": "Cuscuta anthemi, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, thread-like appearance due to its slender, branching stems. The plant attaches to its host using specialized haustoria, which penetrate the host's tissues to extract water and nutrients. Cuscuta anthemi is often found on crops such as wheat, barley, and legumes, making it a significant agricultural pest. Its life cycle involves seed germination, rapid growth toward a host, and the formation of a dense network of stems around the host plant."
