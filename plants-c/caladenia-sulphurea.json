    "intro": "Caladenia sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphur spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its striking yellow and green flowers that resemble a spider, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in sandy soils and is found in open habitats such as heaths and woodlands. It has a slender, erect stem with a single or occasionally two flowers at the top. Caladenia sulphurea is a protected species due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss."
