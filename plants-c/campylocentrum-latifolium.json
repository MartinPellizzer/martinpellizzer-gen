It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers. The plant produces yellow-orange fruits that resemble small starfruits, though they are not related to the common starfruit (Carambola). It thrives in tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits. The species is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
