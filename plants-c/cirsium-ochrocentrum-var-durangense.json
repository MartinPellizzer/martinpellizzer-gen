    "intro": "Cirsium ochrocentrum var. durangense, commonly known as the Durango thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Its flowering period occurs during the summer months, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
