    "intro": "Camellia phaeoclada, commonly known as the pale-leaf camellia, is a species of flowering plant in the Theaceae family. It is native to southern China and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are usually pale green and have a waxy texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its natural habitat. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant produces elliptical, woody fruits that contain several seeds."
