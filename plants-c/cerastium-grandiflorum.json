    "intro": "Cerastium grandiflorum, commonly known as the greater mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often appearing before the leaves fully develop. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are arranged in pairs along the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its flowers attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance."
