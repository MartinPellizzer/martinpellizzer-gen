    "intro": "Coelogyne subulibrachia, commonly known as the slender-leaved orchid, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, typical of many epiphytic and terrestrial orchid species. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a distinctive red lip. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to the humid, shaded environments where it grows. Coelogyne subulibrachia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
