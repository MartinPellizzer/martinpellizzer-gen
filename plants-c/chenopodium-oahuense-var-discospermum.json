    "intro": "Chenopodium oahuense var. discospermum, commonly known as Oahu goosefoot, is a native Hawaiian plant characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. It typically features broadly ovate to rounded leaves with a bluish-green hue and a hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often subtended by modified leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
