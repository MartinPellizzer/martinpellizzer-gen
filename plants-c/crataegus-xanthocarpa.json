    "intro": "Crataegus xanthocarpa, commonly known as the yellow-fruited hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its oval, dark green leaves and small, yellowish-orange fruits that ripen in the fall. The plant produces white or pinkish flowers in the spring, which are often clustered in groups of three. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
