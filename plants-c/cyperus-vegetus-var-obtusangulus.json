    "intro": "Cyperus vegetus var. obtusangulus, commonly known as the broad-angled flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to saturated soils. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, three-sided spikelets, which are usually wind-pollinated. This variant is distinguished by its broader, more rounded leaf bases compared to other Cyperus species."
