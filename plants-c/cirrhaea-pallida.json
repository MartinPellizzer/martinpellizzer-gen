    "intro": "Cirrhaea pallida, commonly known as the pale cirrhaea, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America. It has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes and produce small, white or pale pink flowers. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-green hue, and are arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
