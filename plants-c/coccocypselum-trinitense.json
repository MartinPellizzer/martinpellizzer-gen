    "intro": "Coccocypselum trinitense, commonly known as the Trinidad cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean, particularly Trinidad and Tobago. It is a low-growing, spiny plant with a compact structure and a thick, fleshy stem that stores water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season, typically in the summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. Coccocypselum trinitense is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
