    "intro": "Coffea arabica var. columnaris, commonly known as the slender coffee plant, is a rare and unique variant of the arabica coffee species. It is characterized by its tall, slender growth habit and elongated leaves, which distinguish it from the more common bushy forms of Coffea arabica. This variety is native to Ethiopia and is typically found in high-altitude regions with cool, moist climates. Its flowers are small and white, producing berries that contain the seeds used for coffee. Due to its rarity and specific growing requirements, it is less commonly cultivated compared to other coffee varieties."
