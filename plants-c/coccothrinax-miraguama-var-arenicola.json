    "intro": "Coccothrinax miraguama var. arenicola, commonly known as the sand palm, is a small, slow-growing palm native to the Caribbean. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in dune environments where it helps stabilize sand dunes. The plant has a slender trunk with a crown of feather-like leaves, and it produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into edible fruits. It is well adapted to salt spray and wind, making it a resilient species in harsh coastal conditions. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
