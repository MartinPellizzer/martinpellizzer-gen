    "intro": "Clinopodium grandiflorum subsp. grandiflorum, commonly known as meadow basil or sweet basil, is a flowering plant in the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale blue to lavender flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and along streambanks, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are often used in herbal teas and as a culinary herb due to their fragrant, slightly sweet scent. The subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and its role in attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
