    "intro": "Colubrina vellozoi, commonly known as the Brazilian beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded areas of tropical and subtropical forests. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue berries that are edible for some animals but generally unpalatable to humans. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth texture with a glossy appearance. Colubrina vellozoi is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and fragrant flowers."
