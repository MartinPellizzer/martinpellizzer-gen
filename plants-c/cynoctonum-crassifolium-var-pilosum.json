    "intro": "Cynoctonum crassifolium var. pilosum, commonly known as the hairy broadleaf cycad, is a unique cycad species characterized by its large, broad, leathery leaves covered in dense, soft hairs. Native to tropical regions of South America, it thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk that supports a crown of feathery foliage. It produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
