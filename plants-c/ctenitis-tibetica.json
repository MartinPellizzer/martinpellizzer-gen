    "intro": "Ctenitis tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan ctenitis, is a rare fern species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a unique, segmented structure. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its spores are dispersed through wind, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to its ecological significance and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
