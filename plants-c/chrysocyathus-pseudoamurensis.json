    "intro": "Chrysocyathus pseudoamurensis, commonly known as the Amur sea anemone, is a marine cnidarian belonging to the family Cyathostomataceae. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent polyps and a central, hollow tube that serves as a digestive cavity. This species thrives in shallow coastal waters, particularly in the Sea of Japan and the eastern part of the Sea of Okhotsk. Its structure includes a flexible, fleshy column with numerous tentacles surrounding the oral opening. Chrysocyathus pseudoamurensis plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to nutrient cycling."
