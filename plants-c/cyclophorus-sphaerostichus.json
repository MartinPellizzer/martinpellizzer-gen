    "intro": "Cyclophorus sphaerostichus, commonly known as the globular liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a central axis covered in small, rounded lobes that give it its distinctive appearance. Its reproductive structures, known as sorocarps, contain spores that are dispersed by wind. Cyclophorus sphaerostichus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
