    "intro": "Catha dryandri, commonly known as khat, is a flowering plant native to the horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by woody, three-lobed capsules containing the seeds. Its leaves contain stimulant compounds, primarily cathinone and cathine, which contribute to its traditional use. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils and requires moderate to high levels of sunlight."
