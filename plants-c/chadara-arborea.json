    "intro": "Chadara arborea, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by round, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its valuable timber, it is also an important species in traditional medicine and local economies."
