    "intro": "Cocos nucifera var. tamisan, commonly known as the Tamisan coconut, is a variant of the coconut palm native to the Pacific Islands. This variety is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves. The fruits are typically smaller than those of the common coconut, with a thinner husk and a higher oil content. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires ample sunlight. The Tamisan coconut is valued for its oil and is often cultivated for both culinary and commercial purposes."
