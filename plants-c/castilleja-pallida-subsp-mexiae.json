    "intro": "Castilleja pallida subsp. mexiae, commonly known as the Mexican pale castilleja, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves, relying instead on chlorophyll-containing stems for photosynthesis. The plant produces showy, red-orange to yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its parasitic nature, it forms symbiotic relationships with the roots of other plants, drawing nutrients from them."
