    "intro": "Catasetum bungerothii var. randii, commonly known as the Bunge's Catasetum, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, showy flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. The plant produces a unique structure called a \"labellum,\" which is highly specialized and plays a role in pollination by mimicking the appearance of female bees. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil with consistent moisture. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
