    "intro": "Cochlospermum vitifolium, commonly known as the wine-leaf cochlospermum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with reddish or purple hues. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically red or orange, which attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its spread in natural habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
