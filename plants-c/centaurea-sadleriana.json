    "intro": "Centaurea sadleriana, commonly known as Sadler's knapweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. Its bright yellow to orange flowers bloom in summer, and it produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind. Centaurea sadleriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and hardy nature."
