    "intro": "Clematis atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple clematis, is a vigorous climbing vine native to Europe and western Asia. It features heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of purple and pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are covered in fine, silky hairs, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade with well-drained soil. Clematis atropurpurea is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to climb trellises or walls."
