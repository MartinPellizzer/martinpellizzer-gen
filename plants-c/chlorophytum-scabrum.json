    "intro": "Chlorophytum scabrum, commonly known as spider plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its long, arching leaves that are typically variegated with shades of green, white, and yellow. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers on slender stalks, which are followed by clusters of bright green, football-shaped berries. It is a popular houseplant due to its ease of care and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Chlorophytum scabrum is also known for its ability to purify air and is often used in indoor gardening."
