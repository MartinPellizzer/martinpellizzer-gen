    "intro": "Cirsium pendulum, commonly known as the hanging thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, spiny stems and large, purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has deeply lobed, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Cirsium pendulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
