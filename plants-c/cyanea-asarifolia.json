    "intro": "Cyanea asarifolia, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandalwood, is a member of the Rutaceae family and is native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a small tree or shrub characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored wood and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, spherical fruits. Cyanea asarifolia is known for its slow growth and is often found in moist, shaded habitats on windward slopes. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
