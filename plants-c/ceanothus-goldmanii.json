    "intro": "Ceanothus goldmanii, commonly known as Goldman's ceanothus, is a deciduous shrub native to the coastal regions of California. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. The plant features small, ovate leaves with a bluish-gray underside, and it produces clusters of fragrant, pale blue to purple flowers in the spring. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some areas outside its native range."
