    "intro": "Chupalon viridiflorum, commonly known as the green-flowered chupalon, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, vibrant green petals that contrast with its deep green foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Chupalon viridiflorum is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental appeal."
