    "intro": "Caragana media, commonly known as the Siberian peashrub, is a deciduous shrub native to the cold climates of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 11 pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow pea-like flowers in early summer, followed by small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Caragana media is known for its hardy nature, thriving in poor soils and harsh environmental conditions. It is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a windbreak due to its dense growth habit."
