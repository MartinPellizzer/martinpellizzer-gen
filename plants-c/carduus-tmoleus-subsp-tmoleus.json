    "intro": "Carduus tmoleus subsp. tmoleus, commonly known as the narrowleaf thistle, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers. The plant has a robust taproot system, which helps it survive in arid conditions. Its flowers are arranged in a spherical shape, and it produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds. This species is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber."
