It is characterized by its vibrant, slipper-shaped flowers that range in color from purple to red, often with contrasting yellow markings. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, thriving in cool, moist environments such as Andean cloud forests. Its leaves are elongated and slightly hairy, adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Calceolaria altissima is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
