    "intro": "Carex wootonii, commonly known as Wooton\u2019s sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers. Carex wootonii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
