    "intro": "Cirsium engelmannii, commonly known as Engelmann's thistle, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and large, silver-green leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces purple to pink flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a distinctive, spherical shape. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert habitats. Due to its prickly foliage and showy blooms, it is both a notable weed and an important part of local ecosystems."
