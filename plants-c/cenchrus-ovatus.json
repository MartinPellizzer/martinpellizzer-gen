    "intro": "Cenchrus ovatus, commonly known as the slender grass or slender panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, hairless leaves that are often slightly folded. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is drought-tolerant. Cenchrus ovatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
