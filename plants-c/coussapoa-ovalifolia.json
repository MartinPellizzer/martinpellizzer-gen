    "intro": "Coussapoa ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf arrowroot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Araceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive inflorescence known as a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it a unique appearance. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine and as a source of starchy roots. Coussapoa ovalifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid lowland forests."
