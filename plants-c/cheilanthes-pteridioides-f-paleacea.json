    "intro": "Cheilanthes pteridioides f. paleacea, commonly known as the pale-leaved rock fern, is a terrestrial fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its pale, glaucous foliage and compact, cushion-like growth habit. The fronds are typically narrow and lanceolate, with a leathery texture that helps it thrive in arid environments. This fern is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in crevices, where it can access moisture from rainfall. Its unique morphology and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
