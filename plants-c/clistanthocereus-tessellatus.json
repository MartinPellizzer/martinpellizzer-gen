    "intro": "Clistanthocereus tessellatus, commonly known as the tessellated cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its ribbed, spiny stems that form a dense, globular shape. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and ability to store water make it a popular choice for succulent gardens."
