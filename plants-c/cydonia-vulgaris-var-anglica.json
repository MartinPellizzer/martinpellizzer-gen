    "intro": "Cydonia vulgaris var. anglica, commonly known as the English quince, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces fragrant, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by yellow, inedible fruits that ripen in autumn. The plant is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and alternate, oval-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often used in hedging or as an ornamental plant. The fruit, though tough and astringent when unripe, becomes sweet and aromatic when fully mature."
