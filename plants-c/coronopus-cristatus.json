    "intro": "Coronopus cristatus, commonly known as the crowned bellflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant has a low-growing habit with hairy stems and leaves that are usually opposite in arrangement. Its scientific name reflects its unique appearance, with \"cristatus\" referring to the crown-like structure at the base of the flower. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats."
