    "intro": "Cyperus hermaphroditus var. longiradiatus, commonly known as the broadleaf paperplant, is a perennial wetland plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often dark green and slightly glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that are arranged in dense, cylindrical spikelets. It thrives in moist or wet soil conditions, making it a common sight in marshes and along waterways. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, contributing to its ecological significance in wetland ecosystems."
