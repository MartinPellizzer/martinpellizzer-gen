    "intro": "Cyperus zollingeri var. robusta, commonly known as the robust flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas or along waterways. It produces small, clustered inflorescences that are usually inconspicuous, with wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily in suitable environments."
