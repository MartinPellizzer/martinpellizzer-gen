    "intro": "Coffea nandiensis, commonly known as the Nandi coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to eastern Africa, particularly Kenya and Tanzania, and grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage and produces small, white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. Its seeds, enclosed within the berries, are used to make coffee, though it is less commonly cultivated than other coffee species. The plant's botanical features make it an important subject in both ecological and agricultural studies."
