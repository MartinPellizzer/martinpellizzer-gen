    "intro": "Cassine crocea, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features simple, alternate, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Cassine crocea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
