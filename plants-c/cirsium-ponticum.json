    "intro": "Cirsium ponticum, commonly known as the Pontic thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, wastelands, and rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and large, lobed, gray-green leaves. Its flowers are pale purple to blue, forming dense, spherical clusters at the top of the plant. Cirsium ponticum is known for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
