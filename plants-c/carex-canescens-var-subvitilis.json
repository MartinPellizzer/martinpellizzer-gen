    "intro": "Carex canescens var. subvitilis, commonly known as the pale hairgrass, is a variant of the common sedges, characterized by its pale green to almost white coloration. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has triangular stems and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This variant is notable for its unique coloration and ecological adaptability, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
