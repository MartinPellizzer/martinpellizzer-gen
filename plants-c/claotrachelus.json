    "intro": "Claotrachelus, commonly known as the golden cup fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, frond-like structures that are typically bright green with a waxy coating. They thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The fronds are often divided into small, overlapping segments that resemble cups, giving the plant its common name. Claotrachelus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
