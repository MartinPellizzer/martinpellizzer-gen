    "intro": "Cynanchum serpyllifolium, commonly known as field bindweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its rapid growth and invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
