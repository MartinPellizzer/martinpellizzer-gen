    "intro": "Cochlearia officinalis var. maritima, commonly known as the sea kale, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to salty, maritime environments. Its growth is often limited to tidal zones, where it tolerates frequent exposure to seawater. The plant has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
