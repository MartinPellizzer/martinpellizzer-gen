    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna var. sericea, commonly known as the silky hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed, silvery-haired leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in spring, followed by red, fleshy berries in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. The silky hawthorn is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and insects."
