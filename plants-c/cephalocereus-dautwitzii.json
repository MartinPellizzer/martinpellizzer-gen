    "intro": "Cephalocereus dautwitzii, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in sparse, pale green spines. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, often in shades of white or pale pink. These flowers emit a sweet fragrance and are pollinated by moths and bats. Cephalocereus dautwitzii is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic gardens."
