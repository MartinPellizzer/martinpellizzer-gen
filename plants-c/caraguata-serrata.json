    "intro": "Caraguata serrata, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its ornamental, compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in shaded, moist environments. Due to its historical use in musical instrument making, it has become a subject of conservation concern."
