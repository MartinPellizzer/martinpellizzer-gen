    "intro": "Cordia obliqua, commonly known as the zigzag tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped branches and heart-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Cordia obliqua thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitats."
