    "intro": "Capethia, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, velvety flowers. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, often with a waxy coating. Capethia species are popular as houseplants due to their ability to thrive in indoor conditions with moderate light and humidity. They produce small, tubular flowers in a variety of colors, including purple, pink, white, and yellow."
