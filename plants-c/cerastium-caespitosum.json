    "intro": "Cerastium caespitosum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features prostrate stems that produce small, clustered leaves resembling mouse ears, hence its common name. The plant produces white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Cerastium caespitosum is known for its dense growth habit, making it an effective ground cover in garden settings."
