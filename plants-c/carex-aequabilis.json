    "intro": "Carex aequabilis, commonly known as the smooth sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and clusters of small, spike-like flowers. Native to North America, it thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant produces three-sided, cylindrical inflorescences that are typically green to brown in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems."
