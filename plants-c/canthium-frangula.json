    "intro": "Canthium frangula, commonly known as the common hogweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, and its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, giving it a somewhat similar appearance to the toxic giant hogweed. The fruits are capsule-like and contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in the plant's spread. However, it is important to note that while not as toxic as its larger relative, it can still cause skin irritation in some individuals."
