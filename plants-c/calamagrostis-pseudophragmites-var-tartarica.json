    "intro": "Calamagrostis pseudophragmites var. tartarica, commonly known as the Siberian reed, is a grass species native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. This plant thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike that bears small, spikelet-like flowers. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
