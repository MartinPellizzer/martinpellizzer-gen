It is characterized by its small, green, four-angled stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are typically narrow and opposite, contributing to its compact growth habit. Calycothrix tetragona is adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a resilient species in challenging conditions."
