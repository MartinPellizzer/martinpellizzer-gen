    "intro": "Chondrocarpus, commonly known as the \"hedgehog grass,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive, spiky inflorescence that resembles a hedgehog. The plants are typically found in wet or marshy environments, thriving in temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere. Chondrocarpus species have small, spikelet-based flowers with two to three bracts, and their seeds are often dispersed by water. These plants play an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting local biodiversity."
