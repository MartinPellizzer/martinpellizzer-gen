    "intro": "Cyrtandra ponapensis, commonly known as the Ponap\u00e9 cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the island of Pohnpei in the Caroline Islands. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a smooth texture, while its stems are often woody and branched. Due to its limited geographic range, Cyrtandra ponapensis is considered a rare and endemic species."
