    "intro": "Chrysopogon tener, commonly known as slender goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in harsh environmental conditions. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
