    "intro": "Campanula montana, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright stems covered in soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Campanula montana thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
