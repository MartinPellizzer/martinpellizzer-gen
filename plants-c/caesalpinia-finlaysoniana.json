It is characterized by its striking red, feathery flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the summer months. The plant has bipinnate leaves, which are divided into small, delicate leaflets, giving it a fern-like appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The fruit is a long, slender pod that splits open to release its seeds."
