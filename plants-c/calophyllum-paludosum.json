    "intro": "Calophyllum paludosum, commonly known as the swamp calophyllum, is a tropical evergreen tree native to regions of Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green on the upper surface. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, orange-red fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in moist, swampy habitats and is often found in lowland rainforests. Calophyllum paludosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local communities."
