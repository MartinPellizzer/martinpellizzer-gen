    "intro": "Cytisus nigricans var. elongatus, commonly known as the long-stemmed broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, woody stems that are often more elongated than those of the typical variety, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring, which are borne in clusters along the branches. Its leaves are small, trifoliate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its hirsute appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens and natural landscapes."
