    "intro": "Cattleya \u00d7 juno, commonly known as the Juno Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid prized for its vibrant, fragrant flowers. It originates from a cross between Cattleya labiata and Cattleya mosquensis, resulting in a plant with strong stems and large, showy blooms. The flowers typically feature a combination of white, pink, and purple hues, with a distinctive lip that is often a different color. It is a popular choice for both indoor cultivation and garden displays due to its hardiness and ornamental value. This orchid prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
