    "intro": "Centranthus calcitrapae var. gutierrezii, commonly known as the Sierra Madre erythronium, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
