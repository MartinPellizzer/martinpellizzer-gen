The plant grows in shallow coastal waters, typically on rocky substrates, and is found in the temperate regions of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Its structure consists of a central axis with lateral branches that are often coiled or spiraled. Cyrtosiphonia reflexa plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various small marine organisms."
