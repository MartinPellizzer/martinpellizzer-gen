    "intro": "Cirsium amplifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf thistle, is a perennial plant native to western North America. It is characterized by its large, spiny leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant can grow up to 2 meters tall. Cirsium amplifolium is known for its defensive spines, which deter herbivores and aid in its survival in harsh environments."
