    "intro": "Calyptrocarya bullata, commonly known as the bullate calyptrocarya, is a rare and unique member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded, and often hairy fruits that are covered in a calyptra, a cap-like structure that protects the developing seeds. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are usually pinnately divided, and the flowers are small and white or greenish in color. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
