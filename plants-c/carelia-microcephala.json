    "intro": "Carelia microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf carelia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, dark green foliage with small, rounded leaves that give it a compact appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often used in landscaping for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
