    "intro": "Cologania procumbens, commonly known as the creeping cologania, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Cologania procumbens is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
