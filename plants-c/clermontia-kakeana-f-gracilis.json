    "intro": "Clermontia kakeana f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender Clermontia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories on the island of Molokai. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
