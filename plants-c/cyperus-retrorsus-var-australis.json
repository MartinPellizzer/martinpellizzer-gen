It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and is characterized by its triangular stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and the edges of water bodies, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often wind-pollinated. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and support local wildlife."
