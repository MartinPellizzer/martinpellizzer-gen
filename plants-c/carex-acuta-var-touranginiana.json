It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological restoration projects and wetland habitats."
