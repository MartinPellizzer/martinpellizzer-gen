    "intro": "Cynanchum neei, commonly known as the Chinese milkweed or the Chinese snake's head, is a perennial herb native to China. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by follicles containing toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is typically avoided by herbivores and is used in traditional Chinese medicine."
