    "intro": "Celsia nudicaulis, commonly known as the naked-stemmed celsia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with five petals and prominent stamens. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often have a slightly wavy or toothed margin. Celsia nudicaulis thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions."
