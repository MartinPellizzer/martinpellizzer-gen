    "intro": "Carex wazmanni, commonly known as the Wazmann's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Carex wazmanni is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its ornamental value has also made it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant, low-maintenance plants."
