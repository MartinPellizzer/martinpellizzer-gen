    "intro": "Cranichis scripta, commonly known as the script lily, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white or pale green flowers that resemble script-like patterns, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at high altitudes. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it has a long flowering period that extends into early summer. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species and is protected in many regions."
