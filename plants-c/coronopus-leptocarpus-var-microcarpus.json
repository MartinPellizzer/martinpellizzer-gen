It is a small annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, delicate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by narrow, elongated fruits. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
