It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in sandy or loamy soils in open forests and heathlands. It produces its flowers during the autumn season, and the flowers are pollinated by specific insect species. This variety is part of the Caladenia genus, which is known for its intricate and often striking floral structures."
