    "intro": "Cavallium comosum, commonly known as the hairy thistle, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a robust root system and thrives in well-drained soils. Its fuzzy, glandular hairs on the stems and leaves help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Cavallium comosum is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
