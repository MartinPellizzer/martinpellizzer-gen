It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
