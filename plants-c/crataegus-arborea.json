    "intro": "Crataegus arborea, commonly known as the European hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches, oval leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers in spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus arborea is often found in woodlands, hedgerows, and along stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
