    "intro": "Coelogyne angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a slender, pseudobulb-like stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, arranged in a raceme. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Coelogyne angustifolia is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
