    "intro": "Carpopogon volubilis, commonly known as the creeping grassvetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its small, blue to purple flowers are clustered in dense spikes, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds. Carpopogon volubilis plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations."
