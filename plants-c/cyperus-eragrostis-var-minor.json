It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often brown or pale in color. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in wetland restoration projects. Its botanical features make it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
