    "intro": "Calamagrostis lanceolata var. stricta, commonly known as narrowleaf bluejoint, is a perennial grass native to North America. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces panicles of spikelets that are typically golden to reddish in hue, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other wet habitats. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective erosion control plant in riparian zones."
