    "intro": "Caltha fistulosa f. atrorubra, commonly known as the black-red marsh marigold, is a variant of the marsh marigold native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its striking, dark red to black petals that contrast with its yellow stamens, making it visually distinctive. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often near streams or in marshy areas. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and the leaves are heart-shaped with a waxy surface. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
