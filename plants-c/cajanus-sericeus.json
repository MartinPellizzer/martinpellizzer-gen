It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often grown as a cover crop or for its ornamental value due to its delicate appearance. Cajanus sericeus has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
