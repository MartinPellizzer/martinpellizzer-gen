It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes other milkweeds known for their milky sap. The plant typically grows in moist woodlands and stream banks, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a hairy texture, while its flowers are clustered in umbels and are usually pink or reddish. The plant produces seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
