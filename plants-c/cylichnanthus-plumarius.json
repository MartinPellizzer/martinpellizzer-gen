    "intro": "Cylichnanthus plumarius, commonly known as the golden cup plant, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Cylichnanthus plumarius is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
