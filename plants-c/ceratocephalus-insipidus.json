It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that cling to animals and clothing, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its life cycle is closely tied to seasonal rainfall patterns, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
