    "intro": "Ctenopteris fendleri, commonly known as the Mexican water fern, is a species of fern native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green and slightly curled. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid woodlands. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats on the forest floor. Ctenopteris fendleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
