    "intro": "Cicuta mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican water hemlock, is a highly toxic plant native to North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, but it is notorious for its potent toxicity. The plant features hollow, aromatic stems and small, umbrella-like clusters of greenish-white flowers. Its roots contain cicutoxin, a powerful neurotoxin that can be fatal if ingested. Due to its extreme danger, it is often referred to as one of the most poisonous plants in the region."
