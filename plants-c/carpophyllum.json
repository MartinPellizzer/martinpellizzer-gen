    "intro": "Carpophyllum, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and showy, dandelion-like yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to southern Africa and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Carpophyllum species are typically herbaceous, with smooth, sometimes hairy stems and linear to lance-shaped leaves. They are known for their ability to thrive in poor soils and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
