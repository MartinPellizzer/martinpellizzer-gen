    "intro": "Currania dryopteris, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow fronds that stand out against its dark green foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are pinnately divided, with a distinctive appearance that makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
