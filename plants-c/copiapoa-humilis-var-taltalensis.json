    "intro": "Copiapoa humilis var. taltalensis, commonly known as the Taltal cactus, is a small, columnar cactus native to the coastal regions of northern Chile. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a light green to bluish-green color, often adorned with sparse, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and moths. It is adapted to arid and coastal environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water. This variety is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated in cactus gardens."
