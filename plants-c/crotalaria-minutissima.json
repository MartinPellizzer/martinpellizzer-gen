    "intro": "Crotalaria minutissima, commonly known as the dwarf rattlepod, is a small annual herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tiny, yellow flowers and slender, branching stems. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the genus Crotalaria. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its small size and rapid growth, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
