    "intro": "Crocus samarasii, commonly known as the Samarasii crocus, is a rare and striking bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, cup-shaped flowers that range from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant produces slender, grass-like leaves and has a short, underground bulb that stores nutrients. It blooms in late winter or early spring, making it one of the earliest flowering crocuses. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
