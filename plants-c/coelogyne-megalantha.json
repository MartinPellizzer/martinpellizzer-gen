    "intro": "Coelogyne megalantha, commonly known as the giant coelogyne, is a striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter, often featuring vibrant red or orange hues with contrasting white or yellow markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients, which helps it survive in its often-dry environment. Coelogyne megalantha blooms once every few years, making it a prized species among orchid enthusiasts."
