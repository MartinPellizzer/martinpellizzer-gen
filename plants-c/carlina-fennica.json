    "intro": "Carlina fennica, commonly known as the Arctic carline thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky, open habitats and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are grayish-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its flowering heads are composite, consisting of yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale blue to purple ray flowers. Carlina fennica is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
