It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments."
