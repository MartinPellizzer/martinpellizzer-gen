    "intro": "Centaurea raphanina f. interdicta, commonly known as the edible centaury, is a variant of the common centaury, characterized by its distinctive blue to purple flowers and hairy stems. It is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, typically found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its seeds are small and hardy, allowing it to thrive in disturbed environments. The plant is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves and flowers, which have a slightly bitter, peppery flavor."
