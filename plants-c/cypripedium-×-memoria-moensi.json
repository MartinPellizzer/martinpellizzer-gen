    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 memoria-moensi, commonly known as the Moench's ghost orchid, is a rare hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically feature a pale pink or white color with a deep purple lip. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
