    "intro": "Calamagrostis canescens f. ramosa, commonly known as the silver bluestem grass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and tufted, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet to mesic habitats, such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. It has a clumping growth habit and produces viable seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its ornamental value and ecological role in stabilizing soil make it a notable species in wetland restoration projects."
