    "intro": "Cyathodes robusta, commonly known as the robust cyathodes, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive cyathium inflorescence, which consists of a cup-shaped structure that houses multiple small, reduced flowers. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually large, palmately lobed, and often have a velvety texture. Cyathodes robusta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral structure."
