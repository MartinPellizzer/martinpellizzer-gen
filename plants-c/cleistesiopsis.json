It is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plants typically have small, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white or pale pink petals. They are often found in rocky soils and can withstand drought conditions due to their succulent leaves. Cleistesiopsis species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their delicate appearance."
