    "intro": "Cheiridopsis longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed ice plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss. Cheiridopsis longipes is well adapted to arid environments and thrives in full sun with minimal water."
