    "intro": "Crenulluma kalmbacheriana, commonly known as the Kalmbach's crenulate, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique crenulated leaf margins, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, often with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
