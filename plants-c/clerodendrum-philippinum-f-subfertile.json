The plant is a shrub or small tree with opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and slightly pubescent. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and as a landscape plant in its native region."
