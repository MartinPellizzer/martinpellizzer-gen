    "intro": "Centaurea polyacantha, commonly known as the many-stemmed knapweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Centaurea polyacantha is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its invasive growth habits."
