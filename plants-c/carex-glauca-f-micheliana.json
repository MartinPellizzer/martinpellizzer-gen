    "intro": "Carex glauca f. micheliana, commonly known as the blue-green sedge, is a variant of the common sedge species Carex glauca. It is characterized by its striking blue-green foliage, which gives it a unique and ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds and streams. It produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers in the spring. This sedgy plant is valued in wetland restoration projects and as a decorative plant in water gardens."
