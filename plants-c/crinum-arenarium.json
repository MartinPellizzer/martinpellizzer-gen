    "intro": "Crinum arenarium, commonly known as the sand crinum, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant produces large, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. Crinum arenarium thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is often found growing in dunes or along the edges of the sea. It is a hardy perennial that is well adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure."
