    "intro": "Cactus serpens, commonly known as the snake cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its long, cylindrical stems that resemble the shape of a serpent, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which are often followed by small, red fruits. Its stems are covered in spines that provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss through transpiration. Cactus serpens is well adapted to harsh desert environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
