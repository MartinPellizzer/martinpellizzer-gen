    "intro": "Centaurea fuscomarginata, commonly known as the brown-margin centaury, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This species is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower heads. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas."
