    "intro": "Cleistochloa, commonly known as the spike grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It is characterized by its compact, spike-like inflorescence and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plants typically grow as annual or perennial herbs, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Cleistochloa species are known for their small, inconspicuous flowers that are often enclosed within the spike, a feature that gives the genus its scientific name. These plants play a role in soil stabilization and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
