    "intro": "Carex muricata subsp. ashokae, commonly known as the Ashokae sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of southern India. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a slightly rough texture, while the stems are erect and often clustered. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
