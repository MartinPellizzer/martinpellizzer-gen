    "intro": "Centaurium tenuiflorum f. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered lesser centaury, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Gentianaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its notably lighter floral coloration compared to the typical form of Centaurium tenuiflorum."
