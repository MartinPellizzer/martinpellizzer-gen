    "intro": "Convolvulus preissii, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and distinctive, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh, semi-arid environments. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed in certain areas."
