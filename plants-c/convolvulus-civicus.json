    "intro": "Convolvulus civicus, commonly known as the common bindweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its twining stems that climb or trail along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are heart-shaped and opposite, with a rough texture. Convolvulus civicus is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit."
