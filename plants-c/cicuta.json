    "intro": "Cicuta, commonly known as water hemlock, is a highly toxic member of the parsley family (Apiaceae). It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant contains potent compounds such as cicutoxin, which can cause severe poisoning in humans and animals. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams. Due to its extreme toxicity, it is often referred to as one of the most dangerous plants in North America."
