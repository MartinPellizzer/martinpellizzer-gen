    "intro": "Camphorosma perennis, commonly known as the everlasting pea, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers. The plant is perennial, meaning it lives for more than two years, and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The plant's ability to thrive in arid conditions makes it an important species in its native habitat."
