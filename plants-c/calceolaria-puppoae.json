    "intro": "Calceolaria puppoae, commonly known as the Puppo's slipper orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that resemble small cups. The plant produces showy, violet-colored blooms with intricate patterns, which attract specific pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calceolaria puppoae is considered a species of conservation concern."
