    "intro": "Canthium bipinnatum, commonly known as the two-feathered spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and showy inflorescences. The plant has alternate, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are clustered in cyathium structures, typical of the spurge family, and are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Canthium bipinnatum typically grows as an upright shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters."
