    "intro": "Cylindropuntia \u00d7 viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered prickly pear, is a hybrid cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are often covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow or green flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its greenish-gray foliage. Its stems are capable of photosynthesis, a common trait in cacti, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The species is also known for its ability to form dense colonies, making it both an ornamental plant and a potential weed in certain regions."
