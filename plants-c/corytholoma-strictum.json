    "intro": "Corytholoma strictum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cow-wheat, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The plant has trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being elliptical and hairy on the underside. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Corytholoma strictum plays a role in supporting local insect populations, particularly bumblebees, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
