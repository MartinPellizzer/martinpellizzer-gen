    "intro": "Crepidium godefroyi, commonly known as the Godefroy's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, intricately patterned flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a compact growth habit with a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its often harsh, high-altitude environment. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it prefers cool, shaded habitats with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
