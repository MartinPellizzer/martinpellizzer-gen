    "intro": "Cyperorchis wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's sedge-orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces showy, orchid-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
