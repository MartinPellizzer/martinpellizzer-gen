    "intro": "Cacalia palmatisecta f. pilipes, commonly known as the hairy-leaved bellflower, is a unique variant of the bellflower species native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately divided leaves that are covered in fine, hairy textures, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage and floral structure make it a striking addition to rock gardens and alpine plant collections. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to preserve its botanical characteristics."
