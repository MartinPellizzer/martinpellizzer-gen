It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-shaped clusters called umbels. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found along stream banks and in woodland areas. Its aromatic foliage and delicate flowers make it a distinctive addition to native plant gardens."
