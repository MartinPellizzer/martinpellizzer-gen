    "intro": "Callitriche concinna, commonly known as lesser water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, opposite leaves that are oval to lance-shaped. Its flowers are tiny, usually white or pale pink, and are arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. Callitriche concinna plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
