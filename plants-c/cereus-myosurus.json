It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces large, white, night-blooming flowers that are highly fragrant. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in arid, well-drained soils. Cereus myosurus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique floral display."
