    "intro": "Cactus polycephalus, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its spherical shape and prominent, spiny areoles that bear both flowers and branches. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its thick, waxy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
