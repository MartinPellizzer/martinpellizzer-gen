    "intro": "Cyphia glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular cyphia, is a flowering plant native to the eastern regions of Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, often found in heathlands and open forests. The plant is characterized by its small, glandular leaves and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are covered in tiny, sticky glands, which give it its scientific name. Cyphia glandulifera is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its coastal environment."
