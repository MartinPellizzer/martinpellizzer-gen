    "intro": "Cupressus, commonly known as cedar, is a genus of coniferous evergreen trees and shrubs native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. These plants are characterized by their scale-like leaves, which are typically arranged in flat sprays, and their distinctive, aromatic wood. Cupressus species often have thick, fibrous bark that provides protection against fire and pests. They produce small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, and they are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value. The genus includes several species, such as the Arizona cedar and the Monterey cypress, each with unique growth habits and environmental adaptations."
