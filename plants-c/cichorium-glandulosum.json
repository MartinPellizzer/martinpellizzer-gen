    "intro": "Cichorium glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular chicory, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is native to southern Europe and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. It has a taproot system and is known for its bitter taste, which is due to the presence of sesquiterpene lactones. Cichorium glandulosum is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
