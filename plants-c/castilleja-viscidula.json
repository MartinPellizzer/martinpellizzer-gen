    "intro": "Castilleja viscidula, commonly known as sticky castilleja, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its yellow to reddish-orange flowers for visual appeal. The plant attaches itself to the roots of other plants, drawing nutrients and water from its host. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecosystem dynamics, influencing both plant community structure and nutrient cycling."
