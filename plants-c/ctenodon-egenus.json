    "intro": "Ctenodon egenus, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, delicate leaves and specialized structures for capturing prey, such as bladder-like traps. They are typically found in freshwater habitats, including ponds and slow-moving streams. The genus is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Ctenodon egenus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to water filtration and providing habitat for microorganisms."
