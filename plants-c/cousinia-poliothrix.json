    "intro": "Cousinia poliothrix, commonly known as the purple sandmat, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its striking purple to violet flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and sandy plains. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a woolly texture, adapted to reduce water loss. Cousinia poliothrix is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and dry landscapes."
