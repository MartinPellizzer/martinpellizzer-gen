    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 vanmolianum, commonly known as the Van Molian lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white with a yellow or orange lip. The plant has a pseudobulb structure and produces a single, lanceolate leaf. It thrives in cool, shaded environments with moist, well-drained soil. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
