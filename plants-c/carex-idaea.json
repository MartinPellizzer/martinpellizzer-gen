    "intro": "Carex idaea, commonly known as the snowgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and shady environments. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense mats. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
