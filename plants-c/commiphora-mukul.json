    "intro": "Commiphora mukul, commonly known as guggul, is a small deciduous tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and small, elliptical leaves that turn red in the autumn. The plant produces a resinous gum, known as guggul resin, which has been used in traditional medicine for centuries. This resin is secreted from the bark and is harvested during the dry season. Commiphora mukul thrives in dry, arid environments and is often found in regions with well-drained soils."
