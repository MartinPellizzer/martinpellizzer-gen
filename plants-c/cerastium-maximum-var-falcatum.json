    "intro": "Cerastium maximum var. falcatum, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via runners make it a common weed in gardens and natural habitats."
