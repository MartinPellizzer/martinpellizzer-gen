    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 hartii var. bradleyi, commonly known as the Bradley's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage, with narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in dense, compact clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are usually borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization and wetland ecosystem health."
