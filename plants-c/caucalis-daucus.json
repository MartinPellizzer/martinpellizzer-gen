    "intro": "Caucalis daucus, commonly known as the lesser cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its umbrella-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. Its leaves are finely divided and have a mild, aromatic scent, while its flowers are white or pale yellow. Caucalis daucus is often mistaken for other members of the carrot family due to its similar appearance."
