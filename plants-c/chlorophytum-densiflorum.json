    "intro": "Chlorophytum densiflorum, commonly known as the snake plant, is a hardy, evergreen perennial native to South Africa. It features long, arching leaves that are typically dark green with white or yellow variegation. The plant produces tall, cylindrical inflorescences topped with small, white flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to low-light conditions and requires minimal water, making it an ideal houseplant. Its air-purifying qualities also make it a popular choice for indoor environments."
