    "intro": "Chimaphila monticola subsp. monticola, commonly known as the mountain flameless candle, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically thrives in acidic, well-drained soils found in shaded, forested environments. The plant features opposite, elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy, with a waxy coating. Its flowers are small, tubular, and pinkish-red, clustered in dense inflorescences, and bloom in late spring to early summer. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils through mycorrhizal associations."
