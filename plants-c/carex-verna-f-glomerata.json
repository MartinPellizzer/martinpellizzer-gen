    "intro": "Carex verna f. glomerata, commonly known as the clustered spring sedge, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 cm and thrives in rich, well-drained soil. It is often found in woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. Due to its low maintenance and ability to form dense ground cover, it is a popular choice for native plant gardens."
