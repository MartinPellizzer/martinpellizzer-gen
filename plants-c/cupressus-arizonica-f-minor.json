    "intro": "Cupressus arizonica f. minor, commonly known as the Arizona cypress, is a shrub-like form of the Arizona cypress, characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, typically found in rocky soils and arid environments. The plant features scale-like leaves that are closely pressed to the stems, giving it a textured appearance. Its cones are small and contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in full sun, making it a resilient plant in harsh climates."
