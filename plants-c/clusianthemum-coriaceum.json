    "intro": "Clusianthemum coriaceum, commonly known as the rough clusia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom during the dry season. It is often found growing in rocky or coastal areas where it can tolerate saline conditions. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, sun-exposed habitats."
