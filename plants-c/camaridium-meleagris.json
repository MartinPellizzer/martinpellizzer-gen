    "intro": "Camaridium meleagris, commonly known as the spotted bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers with distinctive spots, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are opposite in arrangement. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Camaridium meleagris is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ease of care."
