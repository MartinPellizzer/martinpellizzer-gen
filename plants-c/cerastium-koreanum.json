    "intro": "Cerastium koreanum, commonly known as the Korean chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Korea. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered with fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Cerastium koreanum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and rocky slopes."
