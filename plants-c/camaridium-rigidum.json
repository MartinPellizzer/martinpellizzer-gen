    "intro": "Camaridium rigidum, commonly known as the rigid sea lettuce, is a marine green alga found in coastal regions. It has a flat, blade-like structure with a firm, waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its aquatic environment. The plant typically grows in shallow waters, often attached to rocks or other substrates. Its cellular structure contains chlorophyll, enabling it to perform photosynthesis efficiently. Camaridium rigidum plays a vital role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
