The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear greenish to brownish flowers, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other wet habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
