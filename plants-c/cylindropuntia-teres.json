    "intro": "Cylindropuntia teres, commonly known as the small spine cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a flowering plant in the cactus family, Cactaceae, and is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions and extreme temperatures. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant in desert gardens."
