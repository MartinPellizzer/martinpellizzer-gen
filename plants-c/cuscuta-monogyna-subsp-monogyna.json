    "intro": "Cuscuta monogyna subsp. monogyna, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrition. It produces small, yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found on plants such as thistles and sunflowers. Its life cycle involves germinating on host seeds and forming haustoria to extract water and nutrients. The species is an example of a holoparasitic plant, meaning it depends entirely on its host for survival."
