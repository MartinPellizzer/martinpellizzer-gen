    "intro": "Chrysosplenium holochlorum, commonly known as the yellow spleenwort, is a species of flowering plant in the family Saxifragaceae. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features delicate, alternate leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually white or pale yellow, and are borne on short pedicels. The species is characterized by its ability to thrive in cool, humid climates and its preference for well-drained, acidic soils."
