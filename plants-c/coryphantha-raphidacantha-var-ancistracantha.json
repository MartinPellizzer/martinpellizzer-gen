    "intro": "Coryphantha raphidacantha var. ancistracantha, commonly known as the narrow-leafed hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, cylindrical stems that are typically green to blue-green in color, covered with fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
