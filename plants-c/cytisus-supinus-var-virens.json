    "intro": "Cytisus supinus var. virens, commonly known as the creeping yellow broom, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a vibrant touch to its foliage. The plant has slender, wiry stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets that are covered in fine hairs. This variety is well adapted to rocky or dry soils and is often found in sunny, open habitats."
