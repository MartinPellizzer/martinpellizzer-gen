    "intro": "Coelogyne hastata, commonly known as the Orchid of the Moon, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters of 5 to 10, often in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte on trees, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered in a thick, velvety coating, which helps retain water. Coelogyne hastata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
