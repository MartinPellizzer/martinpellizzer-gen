    "intro": "Chenopodium effusum, commonly known as smooth lambsquarters, is an annual herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves that are usually hairless or only slightly hairy. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, and its seeds are covered in a fine, powdery coating. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Chenopodium effusum is a common weed but also has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a food source."
