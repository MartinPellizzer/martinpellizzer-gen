    "intro": "Chloris gracilis, commonly known as slender grass or slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Chloris gracilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
