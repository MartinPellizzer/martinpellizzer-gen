    "intro": "Carex tolmiei, commonly known as Tolmieu's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the sedge family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, Carex tolmiei is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
