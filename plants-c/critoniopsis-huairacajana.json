    "intro": "Critoniopsis huairacajana, commonly known as the Huairacaja orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the cloud forests of Peru. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its humid, shaded habitat. Its botanical features include small, lance-shaped leaves and a delicate, fragrant bloom that appears during the wet season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
