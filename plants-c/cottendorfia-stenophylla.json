    "intro": "Cottendorfia stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cottendorfia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its botanical features include a short, herbaceous stem and a preference for well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
