    "intro": "Convolvulus althaeoides var. repandus, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to spread make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in certain environments."
