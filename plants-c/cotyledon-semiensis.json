    "intro": "Cotyledon semiensis, commonly known as the African ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the growing season. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Cotyledon semiensis is popular as a houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
