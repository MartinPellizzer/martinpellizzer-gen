    "intro": "Chrysolaena flexuosa, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging stems that give it its common name. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stems. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes, and it is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance. Chrysolaena flexuosa is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade."
