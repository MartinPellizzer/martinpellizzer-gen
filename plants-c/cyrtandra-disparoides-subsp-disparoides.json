It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue and purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and along stream banks. It has opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and produces small, fleshy fruits. Due to habitat loss and introduced species, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
