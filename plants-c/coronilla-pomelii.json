    "intro": "Coronilla pomelii, commonly known as the Spanish brome, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. It produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind, and it has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits. Its ability to thrive in arid conditions makes it an important plant for ecological restoration in degraded landscapes."
