    "intro": "Calamagrostis mutabilis, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and fluffy, silver-tan plumes that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and marshes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that contrasts with the fluffy seed heads. Calamagrostis mutabilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting wetland biodiversity."
