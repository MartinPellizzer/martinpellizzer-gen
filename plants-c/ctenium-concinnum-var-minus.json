It typically features slender, branching stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots are adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils, making it a hardy species in arid environments. The foliage is often used in traditional herbal practices for its mild aromatic properties."
