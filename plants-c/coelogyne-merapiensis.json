    "intro": "Coelogyne merapiensis, commonly known as the Merapi orchid, is a tropical orchid native to the Indonesian island of Java. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters of up to 20 blossoms, typically in shades of yellow and green. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in its natural habitat. It prefers high light conditions and well-draining soil, often growing in forested areas with high humidity. Coelogyne merapiensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is a subject of interest in botanical research due to its unique floral structure and ecological adaptations."
