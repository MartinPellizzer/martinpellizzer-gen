    "intro": "Crataegus aliena, commonly known as the European hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Crataegus aliena is often found in woodlands, hedgerows, and along stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and garden cultivation."
