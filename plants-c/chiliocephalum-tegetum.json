    "intro": "Chiliocephalum tegetum, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are surrounded by a crown of bracts. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
