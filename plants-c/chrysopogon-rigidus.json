    "intro": "Chrysopogon rigidus, commonly known as rigid grass or rigid sedge, is a perennial grass species native to various regions of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features upright, stiff stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. Its flowering heads are small and clustered, producing tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind. Chrysopogon rigidus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
