    "intro": "Cyperus repens, commonly known as flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It features grass-like leaves that are typically flat and narrow, growing in dense clusters. The plant produces small, three-lobed flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered in panicles. Cyperus repens thrives in moist to wet soils and is commonly found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its adaptability makes it an important component of aquatic and wetland ecosystems."
