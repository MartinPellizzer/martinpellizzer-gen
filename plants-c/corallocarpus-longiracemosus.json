    "intro": "Corallocarpus longiracemosus, commonly known as the long-branch coral tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and consist of several pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in dense, branched inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant's ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in warm climates."
