    "intro": "Clematis vermifuga, commonly known as the wormseed clematis, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and showy, usually white or pale blue flowers. The plant produces small, green, seed-like structures called achene, which are often mistaken for seeds. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets that are deeply lobed. Clematis vermifuga is often grown for its ornamental value in gardens, though it requires support due to its vigorous climbing nature."
