    "intro": "Calinea bentegeati, commonly known as the Bentegeati's bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in sunny, open habitats. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, elongated fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
