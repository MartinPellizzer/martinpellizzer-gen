    "intro": "Campanula lusitanica f. filiformis, commonly known as the slender bellflower, is a rare and distinctive cultivar of the Campanula genus. It is characterized by its slender, elongated stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet. Native to Portugal, this plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its unique morphology makes it a sought-after addition to rock gardens and alpine displays. Due to its limited natural range, it is often cultivated in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
