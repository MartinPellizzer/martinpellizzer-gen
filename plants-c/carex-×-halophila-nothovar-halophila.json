    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 halophila nothovar. halophila, commonly known as the salt marsh sedge, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, typically Carex acutata and Carex lyngbyei. It is native to coastal wetlands and is adapted to saline and brackish environments, making it an important component of tidal ecosystems. The plant forms dense tussocks with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Its ability to tolerate high salinity and periodic flooding makes it a key species in salt marsh restoration efforts."
