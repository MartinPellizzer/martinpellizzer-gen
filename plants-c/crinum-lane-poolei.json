    "intro": "Crinum lane-poolei, commonly known as the Lane-Poole's crinum, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllis family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in coastal and sandy habitats. The plant features large, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad, strap-like, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Crinum lane-poolei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
