    "intro": "Cyanus akcadaghensis, commonly known as the Aksu blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces striking blue to violet ray florets surrounded by yellow disk florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
