    "intro": "Claytonia saxosa, commonly known as the rock chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early spring. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Claytonia saxosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
