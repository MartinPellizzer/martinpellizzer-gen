It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny, smooth seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or sandy habitats."
