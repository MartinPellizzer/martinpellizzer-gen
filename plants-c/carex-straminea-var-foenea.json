    "intro": "Carex straminea var. foenea, commonly known as the foenea sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants commonly found in wet or moist environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in shaded, damp habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its native range."
