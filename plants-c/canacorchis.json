    "intro": "Canacorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale greenish-white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Canacorchis is considered a conservation concern."
