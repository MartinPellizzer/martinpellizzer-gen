It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in Guyana and northern Brazil. The plant is characterized by its glandular hairs on the leaves and stems, which give it its subspecific name. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. The flowers are usually yellow or orange, and the plant produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds."
