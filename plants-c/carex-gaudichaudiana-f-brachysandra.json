    "intro": "Carex gaudichaudiana f. brachysandra, commonly known as the short-stalked sedge, is a compact, clump-forming perennial plant native to New Zealand. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy, with a dense, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or wetland habitats. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments."
