    "intro": "Condylocarpon rauwolfiae, commonly known as the Rauwolfia lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish thallus, which often has a distinctive, wrinkled appearance. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide photosynthetic capability, while the fungal component offers structural support and protection. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to mycologists and ecological researchers."
