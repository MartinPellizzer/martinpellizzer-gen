It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a striking silver-green color, often with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that develop into dark blue berries, which are a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and forested areas. Coprosma putida is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native gardens."
