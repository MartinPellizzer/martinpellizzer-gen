    "intro": "Cleome anomala, commonly known as the spider flower, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, spindly stems and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that resemble spider legs. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Cleome anomala is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun. Its rapid growth and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plant."
