    "intro": "Ceanothus circumscissus, commonly known as the coastal ceanothus, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of narrow, leathery leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, sky-blue flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
