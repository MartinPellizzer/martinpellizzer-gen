    "intro": "Caltha glabra, commonly known as the white marsh marigold, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features showy, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has smooth, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shady environments. Caltha glabra is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges."
