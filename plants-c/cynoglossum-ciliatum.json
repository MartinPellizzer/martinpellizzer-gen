    "intro": "Cynoglossum ciliatum, commonly known as the hairy tongue or blueweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, typically from July to September. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Cynoglossum ciliatum is also known for its medicinal properties, having been used traditionally for its potential anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic effects."
