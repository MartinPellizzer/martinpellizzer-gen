    "intro": "Crataegus boissieri, commonly known as the Boissier hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often have a sour taste. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate to subtropical climates. Crataegus boissieri is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
