    "intro": "Crataegus coccinea var. pubescens, commonly known as the red thornapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive red, orange, or yellow berries that appear in the fall, which are edible but have a tart flavor. The plant has compound leaves with five to seven leaflets and produces small, white, five-petaled flowers in the spring. Its thorny branches and showy fruits make it a notable species in botanical gardens and natural habitats. It is also valued for its ecological role in supporting wildlife, particularly birds."
