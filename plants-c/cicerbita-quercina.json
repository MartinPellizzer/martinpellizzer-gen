    "intro": "Cicerbita quercina, commonly known as the oak bittercress, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. The plant has a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early spring. The seeds are enclosed in a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release the seeds when mature."
