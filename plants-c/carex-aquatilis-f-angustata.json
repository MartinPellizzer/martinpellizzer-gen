    "intro": "Carex aquatilis f. angustata, commonly known as narrow-leaved water sedge, is a variant of the water sedge species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly curved. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often submerged or partially submerged in water. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. This form is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic biodiversity."
