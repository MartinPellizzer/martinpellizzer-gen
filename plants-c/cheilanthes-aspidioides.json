    "intro": "Cheilanthes aspidioides, commonly known as the broad-leaved rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a perennial plant characterized by its leathery, evergreen leaves that are often covered with a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Native to regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus on the underside of its fronds. Its ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it a resilient and adaptive species within its native habitat."
