It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are arranged in fascicles, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Casuarina luehmannii is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
