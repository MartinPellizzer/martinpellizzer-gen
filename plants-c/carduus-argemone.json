It is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, oval seeds that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its botanical features make it both a weed and a plant of ecological significance."
