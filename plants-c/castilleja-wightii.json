    "intro": "Castilleja wightii, commonly known as the Wight's Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red, spurred flowers that resemble a paintbrush. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its root system to absorb nutrients from neighboring plants. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Castilleja wightii plays a role in pollination and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ecological significance."
