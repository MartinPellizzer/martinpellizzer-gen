    "intro": "Corynabutilon \u00d7 suntense, commonly known as the hybrid sunbuttercup, is a rare and intriguing plant resulting from the cross between Corynabutilon corymbosum and Corynabutilon umbellatum. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that resemble those of the buttercup, though it exhibits unique structural features. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments, often found in forested areas with rich, loamy soil. Its foliage consists of broad, heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
