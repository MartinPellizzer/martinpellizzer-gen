    "intro": "Craniotome furcata, commonly known as the forked craniotome, is a rare and specialized plant species found in specific alpine regions. It is characterized by its distinctive bifurcated stem and narrow, elongated leaves that are adapted to high-altitude conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in clusters at the tips of its branches. Its reproductive structures are designed for wind pollination, which is common in its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, Craniotome furcata is considered a vulnerable species in conservation assessments."
