    "intro": "Catalpa arborea, commonly known as the western catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. The tree produces long, cylindrical pods that contain sticky, seed-coated fibers. Catalpa arborea is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in open woodlands. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in the production of cotton-like fibers."
