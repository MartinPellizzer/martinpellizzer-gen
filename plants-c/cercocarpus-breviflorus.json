    "intro": "Cercocarpus breviflorus, commonly known as the cliff-fruit or short-flower curlleaf buckthorn, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces small, red or pinkish flowers in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
