    "intro": "Cyste montana, commonly known as the mountain cyst, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It features a robust root system and erect, branching stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture, and are arranged alternately along the stem. Cyste montana is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often thriving in high-altitude environments."
