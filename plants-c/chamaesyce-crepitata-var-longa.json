It is a low-growing perennial with finely divided, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecological dynamics in its native range."
