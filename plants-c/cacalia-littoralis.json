    "intro": "Cacalia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal cacalia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in salty and windy conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and white or pale pink. Cacalia littoralis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small insects and birds."
