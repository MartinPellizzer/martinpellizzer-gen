It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often fragrant. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense panicles, which are typically borne at the ends of the stems. It is widely cultivated for its essential oils, which are used in perfumes, insect repellents, and traditional medicine. The subspecies hamatulus is distinguished by its hairy, bristly leaves and is often preferred for its strong aromatic properties."
