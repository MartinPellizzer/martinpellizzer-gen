    "intro": "Calcearia selangorensis, commonly known as the Selangor starwort, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its star-shaped, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and often prostrate. Calcearia selangorensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution."
