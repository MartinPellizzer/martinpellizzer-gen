    "intro": "Cyperus brevis, commonly known as the narrow flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and pond margins, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. Cyperus brevis has fibrous roots and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, which are often inconspicuous. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
