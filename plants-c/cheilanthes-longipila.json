    "intro": "Cheilanthes longipila, commonly known as the long-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The fronds are typically gray-green in color, with a leathery texture that helps reduce water loss. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. This resilient fern is often found in crevices and on rock faces, where it forms dense mats that stabilize soil and provide microhabitats for other organisms."
