    "intro": "Carex paucifructus, commonly known as the few-fruited sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its flowering stems produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are often wind-pollinated. Carex paucifructus is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
