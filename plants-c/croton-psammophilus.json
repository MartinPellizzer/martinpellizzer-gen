    "intro": "Croton psammophilus, commonly known as the sand-loving croton, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its ability to thrive in sandy soils makes it an important component of desert ecosystems. Croton psammophilus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh conditions."
