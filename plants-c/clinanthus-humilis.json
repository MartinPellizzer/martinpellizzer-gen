    "intro": "Clinanthus humilis, commonly known as the dwarf clinanthus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of less than 30 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Clinanthus humilis is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
