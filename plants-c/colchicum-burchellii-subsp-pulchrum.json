It features tall, slender stems that bear large, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, often appearing in late summer to early autumn. The plant has large, palmate leaves that are dark green and velvety in texture. It produces distinctive, spathaceous bracts that enclose its true flowers, which are small and clustered at the base of the bracts. This species is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or grassland habitats."
