    "intro": "Cuscuta racemosa var. racemosa, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a raceme, and its seeds are typically dispersed by wind or animals. The plant's slender, thread-like stems can\u7f20\u7ed5 (twine) around host plants, forming a dense network. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in agricultural areas. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, with germination occurring after the host plant has established."
