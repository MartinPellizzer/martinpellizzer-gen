    "intro": "Celtis muku, commonly known as the African boxthorn, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, elliptical leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by round, fleshy fruits that are edible when ripe. Celtis muku thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in savannas and woodland areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
