    "intro": "Croton argyratus var. microcarpus, commonly known as the silver croton, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, glossy, silver-green foliage with intricate veining. The leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, and the plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental leaves and relatively low maintenance requirements."
