    "intro": "Cereus auratus var. mollissimus, commonly known as the velvety night bloomer, is a cactus species native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are covered in a dense, velvety coating of fine hairs. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for both ornamental and horticultural purposes."
