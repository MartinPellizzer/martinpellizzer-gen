    "intro": "Canthium junodii, commonly known as the African spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny calyces that encase its small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds, and it is often found in disturbed soils and open woodlands. Canthium junodii is noted for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
