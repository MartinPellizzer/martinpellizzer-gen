    "intro": "Cerasus avium f. brevipetiolata, commonly known as the short-petioled cherry, is a botanical variant of the sweet cherry. It is characterized by its shorter petioles, which are the stalks connecting the leaves to the stem. This form exhibits typical cherry morphology, with simple, alternate leaves and showy white flowers. The fruit is similar to that of the parent species, featuring a sweet, juicy pulp and a thin skin. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and mild flavor, making it suitable for both gardens and small-scale cultivation."
