    "intro": "Cyperus alpinus, commonly known as the alpine flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family, which includes over 5,000 species. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Its slender, grass-like leaves are arranged in a triangular cross-section, a characteristic feature of many sedges. Cyperus alpinus produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the Cyperaceae family."
