    "intro": "Convolvulus aridus subsp. intermedius, commonly known as the desert bindweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, hairy stems, and small, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its botanical features make it a resilient and often invasive species in disturbed soils."
