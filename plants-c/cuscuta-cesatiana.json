    "intro": "Cuscuta cesatiana, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow-orange flowers and has a vine-like structure with thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to various regions in the Americas and is often found on agricultural crops and native vegetation. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, contributing to its widespread distribution. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and is considered a weed in many areas."
