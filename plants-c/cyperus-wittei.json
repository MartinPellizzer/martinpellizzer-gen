    "intro": "Cyperus wittei, commonly known as the marsh grass or Witte's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Cyperus wittei is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa and parts of Asia. Its ability to thrive in saturated soils makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
