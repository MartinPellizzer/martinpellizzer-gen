    "intro": "Crotalaria cytisoides, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Crotalaria cytisoides is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in open, sunny environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of certain ecosystems, particularly in areas where it contributes to soil stabilization."
