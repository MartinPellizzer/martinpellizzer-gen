    "intro": "Cerastium corniculatum, commonly known as the mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a mat-forming growth habit, often carpeting the ground in moist, shaded areas. It is commonly found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks. Cerastium corniculatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
