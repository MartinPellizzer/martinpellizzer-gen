    "intro": "Cyperus prolixus var. vialis, commonly known as the swamp cyperus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features slender, grass-like stems that often form dense clusters near water bodies. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread rapidly, making it a common invasive species in disturbed aquatic habitats. Cyperus prolixus var. vialis is adapted to thrive in shallow, freshwater or brackish conditions, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds."
