It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length, often floating on the water's surface. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the edges of ponds and lakes. Its leaves are typically a vibrant green, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in water gardens due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
