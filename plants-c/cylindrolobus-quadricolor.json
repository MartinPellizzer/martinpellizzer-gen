    "intro": "Cylindrolobus quadricolor, commonly known as the four-colored cylinder orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its elongated, cylindrical pseudobulbs and vibrant, four-colored flowers that display a unique combination of red, yellow, orange, and white. Its flowers are typically borne in clusters and are highly prized by orchid enthusiasts for their ornamental value. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat challenging plant to cultivate."
