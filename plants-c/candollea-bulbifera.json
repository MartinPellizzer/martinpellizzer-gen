    "intro": "Candollea bulbifera, commonly known as the bulbous fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its clustered, bulb-like rhizomes from which its common name is derived. The plant produces fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into lanceolate, serrated leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
