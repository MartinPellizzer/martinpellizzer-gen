    "intro": "Cyathea kenepaiana, commonly known as the Kenepaiana tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its rhizome is robust, supporting its tall stature, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Cyathea kenepaiana plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability."
