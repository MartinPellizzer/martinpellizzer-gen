    "intro": "Cuscuta kilimanjari var. rukararana, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to grasses and shrubs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex system of haustoria to extract water and nutrients from its host. It is an important component of the ecological dynamics in its native habitat. Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a unique role in the local flora and fauna interactions."
