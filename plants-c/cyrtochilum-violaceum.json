    "intro": "Cyrtochilum violaceum, commonly known as the violet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of violet and white. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and it often grows in association with other epiphytic and terrestrial orchids. Cyrtochilum violaceum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
