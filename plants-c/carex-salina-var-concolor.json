    "intro": "Carex salina var. concolor, commonly known as the salt marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal and brackish wetlands. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated, and it thrives in saline or brackish environments. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Due to its salt tolerance, it is often found in estuaries, salt marshes, and other coastal areas."
