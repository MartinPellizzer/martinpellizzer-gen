    "intro": "Comaropsis sibirica, commonly known as Siberian goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to the colder regions of Asia, including Siberia and parts of Mongolia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as tundra and grasslands. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Comaropsis sibirica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
