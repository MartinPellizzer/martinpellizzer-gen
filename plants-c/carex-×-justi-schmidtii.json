    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 justi-schmidtii, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Carex justi and Carex schmidtii, two species native to Europe. This plant typically forms dense clumps of grass-like foliage with narrow, sword-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are characteristic of the sedge family."
