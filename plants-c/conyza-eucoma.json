It is an annual herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender stems and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs. It is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
