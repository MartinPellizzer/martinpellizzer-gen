This cultivar is characterized by its large, showy blooms that often feature a mix of purple, pink, and white hues. It originates from a cross between Cattleya forbesii and Cattleya andreana, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parent species. The plant typically produces 2\u20134 flowers per spike, with petals that are broad and velvety to the touch. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot."
