    "intro": "Carpinus rupestris, commonly known as the rock hornbeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by oval, shiny, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its fruits are small, woody drupes that contain a single seed, and the plant is adapted to grow in rocky or well-drained soils. Carpinus rupestris is often found in woodlands and rocky outcrops, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
