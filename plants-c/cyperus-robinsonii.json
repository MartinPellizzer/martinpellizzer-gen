    "intro": "Cyperus robinsonii, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 inch wide, with a smooth, dark green surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered at the base of the stems. Cyperus robinsonii thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a food source for various wildlife species and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic habitats."
