    "intro": "Chytropsia, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, waxy leaves and clusters of small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Chytropsia species are perennial herbs that can grow up to 30 cm in height, with some varieties exhibiting a distinctive scent. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in gardens."
