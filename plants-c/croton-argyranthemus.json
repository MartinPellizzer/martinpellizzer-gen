    "intro": "Croton argyranthemus, commonly known as silverleaf croton, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates. However, it is considered invasive in some regions where it can outcompete native vegetation."
