    "intro": "Coronilla petraea, commonly known as the rock coronilla, is a perennial leguminous plant native to rocky and arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on limestone or chalky substrates. Coronilla petraea is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
