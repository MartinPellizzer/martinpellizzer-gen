    "intro": "Cynanchum nigrum, commonly known as black swallowwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by distinctive, spiny fruits that contain toxic seeds. It is often considered an invasive species in North America due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its chemical composition includes various alkaloids, which contribute to its medicinal and toxic properties."
