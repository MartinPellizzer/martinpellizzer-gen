    "intro": "Corymbia sphaerica, commonly known as the white ghost gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey to white bark that peels in thin sheets, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a leathery texture and a bluish-green hue. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species."
