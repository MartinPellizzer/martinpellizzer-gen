    "intro": "Clusia cylindrica, commonly known as the fatshed or cylinder plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and Central America. It features thick, waxy, dark green leaves that are typically oval or elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. Clusia cylindrica is known for its ability to thrive in shaded to partially sunny conditions and its tolerance for dry environments. Its ornamental value comes from its glossy foliage and its use in landscaping and as a houseplant."
