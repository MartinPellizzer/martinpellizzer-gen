    "intro": "Cubeba phyllosticta, commonly known as the cubeba leaf spot fungus, is a plant pathogen that primarily affects the cubeba plant (Piper cubeba). It causes distinctive leaf spot symptoms characterized by dark brown to black lesions on the leaves. The fungus belongs to the family Mycosphaerellaceae and is typically spread through spores carried by wind or water. It thrives in humid conditions and can lead to significant defoliation if left unchecked. Management often involves cultural practices such as proper spacing and pruning to improve air circulation."
