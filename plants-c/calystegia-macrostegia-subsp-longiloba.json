    "intro": "Calystegia macrostegia subsp. longiloba, commonly known as the long-stemmed bindweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit, with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, blooming in summer. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found in disturbed soils, fields, and along roadsides. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
