    "intro": "Clarionea dicephala, commonly known as the two-headed clarion, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bi-colored flowers that bloom in clusters along its slender stems. The plant's leaves are elongated and slightly hairy, adapted to thrive in the humid, shaded environments of its habitat. Clarionea dicephala is noted for its unique floral structure, with two distinct heads on each flower, giving it its common name. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
