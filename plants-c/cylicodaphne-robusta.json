    "intro": "Cylicodaphne robusta, commonly known as the robust arrowroot or giant arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Araceae family and is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by spadices, which are typical of the Araceae family. Its rhizomes are the primary part used, containing a starchy substance similar to arrowroot. Cylicodaphne robusta is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as for its edible rhizomes."
