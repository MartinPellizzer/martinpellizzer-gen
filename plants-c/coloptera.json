    "intro": "Coloptera, commonly known as jewel beetles, are a family of beetles characterized by their metallic or iridescent coloration. They are primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, where they inhabit a variety of habitats including forests, grasslands, and wetlands. The larvae of Coloptera are typically wood-boring, playing a significant role in the decomposition of plant material. Adult beetles are often attracted to light and can be found near light sources at night. Their life cycle involves complete metamorphosis, transitioning from egg to larva, pupa, and finally adult."
