It features showy, yellow to orange ray flowers that surround a central disk, creating a crown-like appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to sandy soils.
