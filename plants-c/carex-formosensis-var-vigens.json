    "intro": "Carex formosensis var. vigens, commonly known as the vigorous flat sedge, is a perennial plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spikes of small, greenish-brown flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshy areas or along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
