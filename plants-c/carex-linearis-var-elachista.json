    "intro": "Carex linearis var. elachista, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in width. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers in the summer, which are followed by triangular, spikelet-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological importance, it is a valuable component of riparian and wetland ecosystems."
