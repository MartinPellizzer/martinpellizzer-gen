    "intro": "Centrosema cuspidatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically narrow and pointed, and its small, yellow to reddish flowers. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are often used as forage or in traditional medicine. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Centrosema cuspidatum has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation."
