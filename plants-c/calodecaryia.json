    "intro": "Calodecaryia, commonly known as the \"ghost orchid,\" is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Calodecaryia has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
