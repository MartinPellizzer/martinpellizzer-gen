It produces striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive purple-tipped style, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy layer, giving it its subspecies name \"vestitum,\" meaning \"cloaked\" or \"dressed.\" It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
