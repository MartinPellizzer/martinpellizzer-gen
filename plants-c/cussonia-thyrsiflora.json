    "intro": "Cussonia thyrsiflora, commonly known as the African nettle or false arrowroot, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters called thyrses. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
