It is a small herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves and small white or pale yellow flowers. Its leaves and stems are edible but have a sharp, peppery flavor due to the presence of glucosinolates. It is often found in temperate regions of Europe and Asia."
