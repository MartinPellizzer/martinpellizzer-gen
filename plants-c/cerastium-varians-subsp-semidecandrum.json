    "intro": "Cerastium varians subsp. semidecandrum, commonly known as the five-leaf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has distinctive basal leaves that are palmately divided into five lobes, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical name reflects its variable growth habits and the presence of five leaflets in some specimens."
