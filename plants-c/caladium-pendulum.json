    "intro": "Caladium pendulum, commonly known as the weeping caladium, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that hang in cascading clusters, creating a dramatic visual effect. The leaves are typically a vibrant mix of red, white, and green, with a waxy texture that reflects light beautifully. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This ornamental plant is often used in hanging baskets or as a decorative foliage plant in shaded areas."
