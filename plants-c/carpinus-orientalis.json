    "intro": "Carpinus orientalis, commonly known as the Oriental hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by edible, round berries that are consumed by various bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. The Oriental hornbeam is also valued for its ability to tolerate urban environments and air pollution."
