    "intro": "Cephalaria mauritanica subsp. maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan cephalaria, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
