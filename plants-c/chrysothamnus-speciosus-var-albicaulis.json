    "intro": "Chrysothamnus speciosus var. albicaulis, commonly known as the white-stemmed goldenbush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and white, hairy stems, which distinguish it from other varieties of goldenbush. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soils in native plant gardens."
