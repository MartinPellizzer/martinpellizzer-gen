It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a dense rosette, with a distinctive pale green to bluish-green coloration. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along stream edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
