    "intro": "Ctenitis crinita var. setacea, commonly known as the hairy ctenitis, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant's fronds are typically long and slender, with a hairy texture on the underside, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
