    "intro": "Clermontia macrocarpa var. hawaiiensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian mountain ginger, is a flowering plant native to the island of Hawaii. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble gingers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, with a glossy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
