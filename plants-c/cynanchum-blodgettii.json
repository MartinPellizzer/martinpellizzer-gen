    "intro": "Cynanchum blodgettii, commonly known as Blodgett's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to survive in poor soil conditions. Cynanchum blodgettii is also known for its milky sap, which is a characteristic feature of many species in its family."
