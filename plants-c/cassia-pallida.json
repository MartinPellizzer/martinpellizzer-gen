    "intro": "Cassia pallida, commonly known as white cassia, is a shrub native to parts of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and large, palmately compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, seed-rich seeds. Cassia pallida is known for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments."
