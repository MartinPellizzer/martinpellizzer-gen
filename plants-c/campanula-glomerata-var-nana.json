    "intro": "Campanula glomerata var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf bellflower, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features clusters of small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to both wildflower gardens and cultivated landscapes."
