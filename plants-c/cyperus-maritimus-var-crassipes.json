It typically grows in saline or brackish wetlands, thriving in muddy or sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale to brownish flowers. It is often found in estuaries and tidal flats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms. Its adaptability to high salinity and fluctuating water levels makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
