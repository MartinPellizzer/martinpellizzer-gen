    "intro": "Croton pulegioides, commonly known as the pennyroyal plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, opposite leaves that are often aromatic and have a distinctive, mint-like scent. The plant produces tiny, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used historically for its antiseptic and insect-repelling qualities."
