    "intro": "Cirsium schakaptaricum, commonly known as Schakaptari thistle, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, spiny leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in stiff, prickly hairs, which help to deter herbivores. The flowers, which bloom in late summer, are usually purple or pink and are arranged in a rounded, spherical shape."
