    "intro": "Corylus atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple husk hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark purple to reddish-brown husks that encase its edible nuts. The plant produces catkin-like male flowers and female flowers that develop into the distinctive husks. Its leaves are oval with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Corylus atropurpurea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
