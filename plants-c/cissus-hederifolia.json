The plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. It is a member of the family Vitaceae, which includes many climbing plants. Cissus hederifolia is also known for its ability to exude a sticky substance from its stems, which can be used as a natural adhesive."
