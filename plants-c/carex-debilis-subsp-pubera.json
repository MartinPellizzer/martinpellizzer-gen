    "intro": "Carex debilis subsp. pubera, commonly known as the silky sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely covered with short, soft hairs, giving it a silky texture. Its inflorescence consists of a single spike of small, three-sided flowers, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. This subspecies is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
