It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and spiny pods. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, and the plant is often used in forage and soil improvement due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. However, it can be invasive in some areas, posing challenges to local ecosystems."
