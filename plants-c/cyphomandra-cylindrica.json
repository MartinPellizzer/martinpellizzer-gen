    "intro": "Cyphomandra cylindrica, commonly known as the golden apple gum, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits that turn yellow when mature. The fruit is edible and has a tangy, sour flavor, making it popular in local cuisines. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry forests."
