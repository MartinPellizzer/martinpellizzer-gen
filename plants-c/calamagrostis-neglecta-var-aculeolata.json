    "intro": "Calamagrostis neglecta var. aculeolata, commonly known as the needlegrass panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive silvery-blue hue, and its culms are often covered in fine, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
