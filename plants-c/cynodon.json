    "intro": "Cynodon, commonly known as Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species belonging to the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and dense growth habit, making it highly adaptable to various environments. The plant has a rhizomatous and stolonal growth system, allowing it to spread rapidly and form a dense sod. It thrives in full sun and is drought-tolerant, which contributes to its widespread distribution. Cynodon is also known for its ability to recover quickly from damage, making it a popular choice for lawns and erosion control."
