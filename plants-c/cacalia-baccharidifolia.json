    "intro": "Cacalia baccharidifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which reflects sunlight and reduces water loss, an adaptation to its arid environment. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a desirable addition to native plant gardens."
