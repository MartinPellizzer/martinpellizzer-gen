    "intro": "Copiapoa knizei, commonly known as the Knizei's cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is a columnar cactus with a ribbed structure and typically features a single, spiny stem. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers during the cooler months, usually in spring. Its dense, woolly covering helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Copiapoa knizei is adapted to extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient and unique member of the cactus family."
