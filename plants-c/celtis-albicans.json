    "intro": "Celtis albicans, commonly known as the white hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Elaeocarpaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, white flowers that appear in spring. The tree produces small, round berries that are edible for some wildlife but not typically for humans. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value in landscaping. Celtis albicans is often found in moist bottomlands and along streams, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various species."
