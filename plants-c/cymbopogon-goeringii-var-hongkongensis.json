    "intro": "Cymbopogon goeringii var. hongkongensis, commonly known as Hong Kong citron grass, is a perennial grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are often aromatic and used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along riverbanks or in forest understories. Its flowering stems produce small, clustered inflorescences, and it is valued for its essential oils, which are used in aromatherapy and culinary applications. This variety is closely related to other members of the Cymbopogon genus, which includes lemongrass and citronella."
