    "intro": "Callionia, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It consists of several species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, featuring woody stems and palmate leaves. Callionia species are well adapted to dry conditions, with thick leaves and deep root systems that help them survive in harsh environments."
