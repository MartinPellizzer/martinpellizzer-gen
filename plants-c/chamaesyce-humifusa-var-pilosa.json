    "intro": "Chamaesyce humifusa var. pilosa, commonly known as woolly groundsel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, fuzzy silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive, mat-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its hairy leaves are adapted to retain moisture and reduce water loss, making it drought-tolerant. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, often found in open woodlands and disturbed sites."
