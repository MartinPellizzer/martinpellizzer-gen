    "intro": "Cyperus gracilis var. rigidellus, commonly known as rigid flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, erect stems that are typically less than 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are often clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common weed in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
