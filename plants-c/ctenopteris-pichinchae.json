    "intro": "Ctenopteris pichinchae, commonly known as the Ecuadorian water fern, is a species of fern native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often submerged, allowing it to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions. Ctenopteris pichinchae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
