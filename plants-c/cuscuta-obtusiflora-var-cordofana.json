    "intro": "Cuscuta obtusiflora var. cordofana, commonly known as the Southern dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, hairless stems. The plant is native to the southeastern United States and thrives in moist, disturbed habitats. It is often found parasitizing crops such as soybeans and cotton, causing significant agricultural damage. Its life cycle involves germination, attachment to a host, and the production of seeds that can remain viable in the soil for years."
