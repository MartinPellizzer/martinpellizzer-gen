    "intro": "Clitandra membranacea, commonly known as the membranous clitandra, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky pubescence. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
