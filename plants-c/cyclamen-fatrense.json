    "intro": "Cyclamen fatrense, commonly known as the Fatrense cyclamen, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves and vibrant, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Its tuberous roots allow it to survive in harsh conditions, storing nutrients and water. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclamen fatrense is considered a conservation concern."
