    "intro": "Cynanchum taxifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to regions of East Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by follicles containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested or mountainous areas. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
