    "intro": "Cyrtandra jellesmani, commonly known as the Jellesman's heliconia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, and is characterized by its striking, inflorescence-like structures that resemble a spiral of brightly colored bracts. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with broad, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers, which are actually modified leaves, are often yellow or orange in color and serve as a nectar source for various pollinators. Cyrtandra jellesmani is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
