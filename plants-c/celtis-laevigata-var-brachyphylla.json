    "intro": "Celtis laevigata var. brachyphylla, commonly known as the dwarf honeylocust, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by smooth, round fruits that are typically eaten by wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for urban landscaping and small garden spaces."
