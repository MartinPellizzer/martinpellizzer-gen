It features heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed and have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, grape-like berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Its vigorous growth makes it suitable for trellises or hanging baskets."
