    "intro": "Cypripedium spicerianum leodiense, commonly known as the Leodiense\u6753\u5170, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to specific regions of North America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive pouch-shaped lip and a dark, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. It has thick, fleshy rhizomes and produces a single, upright stem with broad, ovate leaves. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
