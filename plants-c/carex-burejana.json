    "intro": "Carex burejana, commonly known as the Burejana sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Europe. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are grass-like and arranged in a triangular cross-section, a characteristic feature of many sedges. The flowering spikes are usually clustered at the top of the plant, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers."
