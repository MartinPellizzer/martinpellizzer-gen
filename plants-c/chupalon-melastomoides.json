    "intro": "Chupalon melastomoides, commonly known as the scarlet bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from red to purple. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, with opposite, ovate leaves that have a glossy surface. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Chupalon melastomoides thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in association with other epiphytic and shade-tolerant species."
