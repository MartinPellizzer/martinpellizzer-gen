    "intro": "Cyclosorus queenslandicus, commonly known as the Queensland cyclosorus, is a rare and endemic fern species native to Australia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests or wetlands. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
