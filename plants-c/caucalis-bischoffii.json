    "intro": "Caucalis bischoffii, commonly known as the Balkan bellflower, is a perennial herb native to parts of the Balkan Peninsula. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or grassy habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
