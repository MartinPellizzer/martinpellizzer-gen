    "intro": "Cereus tunilla, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The flowers are short-lived, often closing by dawn, making it a striking but brief addition to any garden."
