    "intro": "Cyperus glaucus var. gracilis, commonly known as slender flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, ponds, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
