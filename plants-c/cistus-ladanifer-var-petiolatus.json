    "intro": "Cistus ladanifer var. petiolatus, commonly known as the petiolate rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a resinous substance called ladanum, which has been historically used in perfumery and traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or arid environments. Its hardy nature and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and garden landscapes."
