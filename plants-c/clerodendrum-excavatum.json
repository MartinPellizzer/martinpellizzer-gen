    "intro": "Clerodendrum excavatum, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, papery, orange-red bracts that resemble small lanterns, which are often used in ornamental horticulture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly rough texture, contributing to its unique botanical appearance."
