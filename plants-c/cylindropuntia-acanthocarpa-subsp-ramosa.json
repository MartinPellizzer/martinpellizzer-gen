    "intro": "Cylindropuntia acanthocarpa subsp. ramosa, commonly known as the ramose cholla, is a spineless cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, segmented stems that branch profusely, giving it a bushy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its stems are covered in small, hair-like structures called areoles, which serve as the attachment points for spines, flowers, and branches. This subspecies is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
