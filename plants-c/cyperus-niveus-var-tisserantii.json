    "intro": "Cyperus niveus var. tisserantii, commonly known as the white flatsedge, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in dense, spike-like clusters. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, often with a slight sheen, and it produces distinctive, three-lobed seed heads. This variant is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or bog landscapes."
