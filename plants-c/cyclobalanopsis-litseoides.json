    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis litseoides, commonly known as the broad-leaved ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and broad, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, chestnut-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forests. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is considered a valuable but threatened species in its native range."
