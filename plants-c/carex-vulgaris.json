    "intro": "Carex vulgaris, commonly known as common sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of flowers that are typically green or brown in color. The plant thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, stream banks, and pond edges. It has a robust rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense stands. Carex vulgaris plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
