    "intro": "Cytheris cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often above the water surface. Its roots are adapted for anchoring in muddy substrates and for absorbing nutrients from the water. Cytheris cordifolia plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
