    "intro": "Campanula bononiensis var. ruthenica, commonly known as the Ruthenian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically lanceolate and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is well-suited for moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to both wildflower gardens and naturalized settings."
