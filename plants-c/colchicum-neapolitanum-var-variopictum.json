    "intro": "Colchicum neapolitanum var. variopictum, commonly known as the Naples colchicum, is a striking bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It features showy, spurred flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette, and its bulbs are adapted for storage of nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is also threatened by habitat loss and over-collection."
