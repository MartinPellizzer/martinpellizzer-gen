    "intro": "Celastrus buxifolius var. venenatus, commonly known as the poisonwood vine, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, glossy, ovate leaves that are often mistaken for those of the common boxleaf (Celastrus buxifolius). The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by small, fleshy berries that contain toxic seeds. It is known for its potent toxicity, with all parts of the plant containing various alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided in horticulture and is more commonly found in wild, undisturbed habitats."
