It is a low-growing annual herb with a sprawling habit, featuring slender, branched stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical heads, followed by woody, spiny pods that contain several seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough, hairy texture. Cremastosperma dolichopodum is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
