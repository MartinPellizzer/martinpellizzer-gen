    "intro": "Cyperus luteus var. brevinux, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and shallow water areas, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. Its small, clustered flowers are usually greenish or brownish, and it produces small, three-angled seeds. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical Cyperus luteus."
