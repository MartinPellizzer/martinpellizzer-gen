    "intro": "Coptis quinquefolia var. stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous golden thread, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features a rhizomatous root system that spreads horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by small, oval-shaped berries. Its leaves are typically trifoliate or palmately compound, with a distinctive waxy coating. This variant is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its alkaloid content, which has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
