    "intro": "Cyathea alticola, commonly known as the highland tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate rainforests. Its rhizomes are robust and help anchor it to the forest floor, while its fronds are used for photosynthesis. Cyathea alticola plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various native species."
