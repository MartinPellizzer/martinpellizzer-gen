    "intro": "Claytonia megarhiza var. bellidifolia, commonly known as the bell-shaped spring beauty, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are broad and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in its woodland habitat. Its roots are fibrous and often form a dense network, aiding in nutrient absorption and soil stabilization. The species is well-suited to moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
