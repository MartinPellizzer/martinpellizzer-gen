    "intro": "Carex scita var. koraginensis, commonly known as the Koragin's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of eastern Europe and western Siberia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of ponds. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many Cyperaceae species. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
