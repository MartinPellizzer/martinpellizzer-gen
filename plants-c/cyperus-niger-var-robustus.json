    "intro": "Cyperus niger var. robustus, commonly known as black flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy areas. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green with a reddish or purplish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered at the base of the plant. It thrives in moist to waterlogged soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its dense growth habit, it can become invasive in certain wetland environments."
