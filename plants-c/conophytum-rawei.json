It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Conophytum rawei produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
