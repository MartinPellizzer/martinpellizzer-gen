It is characterized by its distinctive blue-green leaves and spiny, prickly fruits that resemble small, inflated balls. The plant produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Cocculus glaucescens is often found in fields, roadsides, and along creek banks. It is a member of the Bindweed family (Convolvulaceae) and is known for its rapid growth and invasive tendencies in certain regions."
