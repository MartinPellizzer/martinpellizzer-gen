    "intro": "Cissus bussei, commonly known as the African snow vine, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing stems and distinctive, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, fleshy fruits that are typically red or yellow when ripe. Cissus bussei is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its unique appearance and ability to climb make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
