    "intro": "Cousinia stechmanniopsis, commonly known as the Stechmann's cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish composite flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are typically silver-gray, covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Cousinia stechmanniopsis is adapted to cold, dry climates and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
