    "intro": "Celsia betonicifolia, commonly known as the marsh gentian, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of blue to violet, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. It is a perennial species that plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Its botanical features make it an important indicator plant for wetland ecosystems."
