    "intro": "Cyperus uniflorus var. pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf umbrella sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a compact rosette. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered at the base of the leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along water edges. Its compact size and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and wetland restoration projects."
