It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its aromatic foliage has been historically used in herbal remedies and as a flavoring agent."
