It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically ranging in color from pale blue to deep violet. The plant has lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and forest edges at high elevations. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
