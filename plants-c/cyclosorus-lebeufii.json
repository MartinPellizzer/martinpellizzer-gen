    "intro": "Cyclosorus lebeufii, commonly known as the Lebeuf's water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to the freshwater habitats of South America. It belongs to the family Hydrocharitaceae and is characterized by its dense, floating mats of narrow, ribbon-like leaves. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving waters, often forming dense colonies that provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are usually arranged in a whorled pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged. Cyclosorus lebeufii is valued in aquatic gardens for its ornamental appearance and ability to improve water quality by absorbing nutrients."
