    "intro": "Clitoriopsis mollis, commonly known as the soft clawviolet, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in spring. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Clitoriopsis mollis is considered a rare and endangered species."
