    "intro": "Cleyera grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered cleyera, is a deciduous shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Actinidiaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring or early summer. Its fruits are red, fleshy berries that mature in the fall and are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Cleyera grandiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil with partial shade."
