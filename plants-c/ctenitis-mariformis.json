    "intro": "Ctenitis mariformis, commonly known as the sea holly, is a rare and unique fern species native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate fronds that resemble the shape of a sea urchin, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments near the shoreline, where it benefits from the saline mist and nutrient-rich substrates. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are clustered on the undersides of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ctenitis mariformis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
