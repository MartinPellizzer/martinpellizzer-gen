    "intro": "Crotalaria stipularia var. serpyllifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf false flax, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow, butterfly-shaped flowers. The plant has slender, branching stems and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being narrow and serrated. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
