    "intro": "Crataegus aronia, commonly known as the black hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red, juicy berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Crataegus aronia is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, thriving in partial to full shade. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a valuable plant in native landscapes."
