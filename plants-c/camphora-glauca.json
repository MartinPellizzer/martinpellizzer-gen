    "intro": "Camphora glauca, commonly known as the white camphor tree, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its essential oils, particularly camphor, have been used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent. The tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in forest ecosystems."
