    "intro": "Chloris radiata, commonly known as the silver grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It features slender, silver-blue foliage with a distinctive, fluffy appearance due to its fine, hair-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental gardening for its striking visual appeal. Chloris radiata is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects and its low maintenance requirements."
