    "intro": "Cinna pendula var. acutiflora, commonly known as the slender cinnamon fern, is a striking ornamental plant native to eastern North America. It features a tall, arching frond that can reach up to 3 feet in height, with a distinctive cinnamon-brown fiddlehead at the base. The plant produces small, delicate white flowers in late spring, which develop into spore-bearing structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often used in wetland restoration projects. Its unique appearance and ecological benefits make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
