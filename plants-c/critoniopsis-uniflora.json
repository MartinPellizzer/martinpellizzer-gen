    "intro": "Critoniopsis uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower rock cress, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or arid environments. The plant produces a single, showy flower per stem, usually in shades of white or pale yellow. Its leaves are linear and succulent, adapted to conserve water in its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
