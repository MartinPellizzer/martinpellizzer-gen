    "intro": "Carex heleochariformis, commonly known as the marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, triangular leaves and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. Native to wetland environments, it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by water or wind. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems."
