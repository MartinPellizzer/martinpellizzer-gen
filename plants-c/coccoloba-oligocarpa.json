It is native to tropical regions of the Americas, including the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its small, red, fleshy fruits that are adapted for dispersal by water. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It plays an important ecological role in coastal and brackish water environments."
