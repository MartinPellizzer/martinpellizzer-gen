It features a pseudobulb with a single leaf and produces racemes of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Its flowers are typically short-lived but highly prized in horticulture for their beauty and fragrance. Coelogyne senagangensis is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
