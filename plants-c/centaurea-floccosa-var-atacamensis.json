    "intro": "Centaurea floccosa var. atacamensis, commonly known as the Atacama cottonthrift, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its soft, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which give it its common name. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, yellow to orange flowers. It is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, with a deep root system and reduced leaf surface area. This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations to harsh desert environments."
