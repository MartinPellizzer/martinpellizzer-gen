It belongs to the Cannabaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by small, round drupes that turn red when mature. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in dry forests and woodlands. Celtis madagascariensis is valued for its hard wood and is also used in traditional medicine."
