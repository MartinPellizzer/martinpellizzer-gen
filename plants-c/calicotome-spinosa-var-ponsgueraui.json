    "intro": "Calicotome spinosa var. ponsgueraui, commonly known as the Socotra cactus, is a unique succulent native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its spiny, branching stems and small, fleshy leaves that help it store water in its arid environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. It is adapted to survive in extreme conditions with minimal rainfall and high temperatures. Its distinctive morphology makes it a notable species in the flora of Socotra."
