    "intro": "Cocos mamillaris, commonly known as the milk nut or milk tree, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its palm-like appearance, with a smooth, often grayish trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fruit that resembles a small coconut. Its unique structure and ornamental value make it a popular choice for indoor gardening. The plant is relatively easy to care for, requiring bright indirect light and well-draining soil."
