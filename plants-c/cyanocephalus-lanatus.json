    "intro": "Cyanocephalus lanatus, commonly known as the blue-headed cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a striking blue-gray coloration that becomes more pronounced with age. The plant features dense, spiny stems covered in white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its flowers are typically pale blue or purple, appearing in the spring and attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cyanocephalus lanatus is a slow-growing, drought-tolerant plant that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun."
