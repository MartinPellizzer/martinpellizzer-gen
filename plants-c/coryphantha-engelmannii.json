    "intro": "Coryphantha engelmannii, commonly known as Engelmann's coryphantha, is a species of flowering plant in the cacti family, Cactaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its globular shape, spiny stems, and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It has small, paddle-shaped leaves that are often hidden beneath its spines, which help reduce water loss. Coryphantha engelmannii is well adapted to desert conditions, making it a resilient and drought-tolerant species."
