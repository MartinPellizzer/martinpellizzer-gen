    "intro": "Cercis \u00d7 yaltirikii, commonly known as the Persian maple, is a hybrid deciduous tree that combines traits from Cercis orientalis and Cercis siliquastrum. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. The tree produces small, pea-like flowers in clusters, typically appearing before the leaves in early spring. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming more textured with age. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens for its seasonal color changes."
