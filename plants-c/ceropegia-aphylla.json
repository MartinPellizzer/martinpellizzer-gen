    "intro": "Ceropegia aphylla, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, trailing stems and small, waxy leaves that help it store water. The plant produces delicate, tubular flowers that are often pale green or white, adapted for specific pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
