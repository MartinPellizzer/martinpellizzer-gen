    "intro": "Celtis aculeata var. serrata, commonly known as the serrate box-elder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in urban environments. The species is valued for its adaptability and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental qualities."
