    "intro": "Castanea ozarkensis, commonly known as the Ozark chestnut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southern United States. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and hickories, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and cupule fruits. The plant produces edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, similar to other chestnut species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas of the Ozark and Ouachita Mountains. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts."
