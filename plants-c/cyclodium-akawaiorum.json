    "intro": "Cyclodium akawaiorum, commonly known as the Hawaiian cyclodium, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often lance-shaped, adapted to the dry, coastal environments where it thrives. It is an endemic species, found primarily on the islands of Oahu and Molokai. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered vulnerable and is protected under conservation efforts in Hawaii."
