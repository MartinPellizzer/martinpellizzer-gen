    "intro": "Calliandra medellinensis, commonly known as the Medellin calliandra, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is known for its leguminous plants that often have nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, feathery, pink or red inflorescences that bloom throughout the dry season. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. Calliandra medellinensis is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking floral display and adaptability to various soil types."
