    "intro": "Carex digitata subsp. quadriflora, commonly known as the four-flowered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in wetlands. The subspecies is distinguished by its four-flowered spikelets, which are a key identifying feature."
