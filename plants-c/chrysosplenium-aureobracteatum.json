It is characterized by its delicate, creeping growth habit and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels. The plant features serrated, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
