    "intro": "Conopodium marizianum, commonly known as the marizianum bladder nut, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, white flowers. The plant produces distinctive bladder-like fruits that enclose its seeds, a feature that aids in its dispersal. It thrives in rocky or calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
