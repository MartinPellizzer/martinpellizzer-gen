It is a member of the Asclepiadaceae family, which includes other milkweeds known for their milky sap. The plant typically grows as a perennial shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its showy, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in umbels and attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. The latex-like sap of this plant contains toxic compounds, which can be harmful if ingested."
