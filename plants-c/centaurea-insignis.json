It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flower heads and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous regions. It produces small, cylindrical seeds that are dispersed by wind. Centaurea insignis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
