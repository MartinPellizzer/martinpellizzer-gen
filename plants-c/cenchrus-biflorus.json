    "intro": "Cenchrus biflorus, commonly known as the two-flowered panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear two distinct flower clusters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it is often used in erosion control due to its hardy nature. Cenchrus biflorus is also valued in some regions for forage and as a component in traditional landscaping."
