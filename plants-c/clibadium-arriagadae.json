    "intro": "Clibadium arriagadae, commonly known as the Arriagada's sida, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, tropical environments and thrives in well-drained soils. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind or water. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
