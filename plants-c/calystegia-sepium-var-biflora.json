    "intro": "Calystegia sepium var. biflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered bindweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its twining stems that climb or trail along the ground. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are heart-shaped and alternate along the stems, while its roots are fibrous and can form extensive underground networks. This species is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
