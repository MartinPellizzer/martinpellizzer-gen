It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or dune environments. Due to its historical significance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical and ecological research."
