    "intro": "Cocos coronata var. todari, commonly known as the Todari coconut, is a variant of the coconut palm native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into hard-shelled fruits. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained sandy soil, and it requires full sun exposure for optimal growth. Its fruit is typically harvested when the outer husk begins to split, revealing the white, fleshy endosperm. The Todari coconut is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and coastal areas."
