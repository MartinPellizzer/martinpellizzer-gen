    "intro": "Candollea despecta, commonly known as the \"ugly orchid,\" is a rare and striking orchid native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its unusual, often distorted floral structure, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, thriving in cool and humid conditions. Its flowers are usually a mix of green, yellow, and orange, with a peculiar, almost grotesque appearance. Candollea despecta is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its unique morphology and limited distribution."
