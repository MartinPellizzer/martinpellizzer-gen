It features delicate, spurred flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is complemented by its historical use in traditional medicine."
