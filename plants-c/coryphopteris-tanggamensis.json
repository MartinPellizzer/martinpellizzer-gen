    "intro": "Coryphopteris tanggamensis, commonly known as the Tenggaring fern, is a species of fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, a common feature among ferns. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
