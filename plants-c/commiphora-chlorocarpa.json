It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by small, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed. Its sap, which is pale yellow, has been used traditionally in some regions for medicinal purposes. The tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
