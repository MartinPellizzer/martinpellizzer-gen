    "intro": "Cerastium austroalpinum, commonly known as the alpine chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically thrives in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense mats to withstand harsh conditions. Its leaves are usually opposite and covered in fine hairs, and it produces white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. Cerastium austroalpinum is often found in meadows, screes, and slopes at high altitudes."
