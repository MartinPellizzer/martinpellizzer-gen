    "intro": "Croton mongue var. borealis, commonly known as the Arctic croton, is a rare and cold-hardy variant of the Croton genus. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features striking, variegated foliage with shades of green, yellow, and red, making it a visually appealing ornamental species. Its leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and challenging plant to cultivate outside its native range."
