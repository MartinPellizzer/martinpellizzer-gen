    "intro": "Caragana grandiflora, commonly known as the peashrub, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 pairs of leaflets, and its distinctive yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Caragana grandiflora is adapted to harsh environments, including arid and semi-arid climates, and is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
