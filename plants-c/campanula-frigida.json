    "intro": "Campanula frigida, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic regions and subarctic areas of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dark green, lance-shaped leaves and striking blue or violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in cold, rocky environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Campanula frigida is often found in tundra and alpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying plant adaptations to extreme environments."
