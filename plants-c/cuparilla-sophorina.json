    "intro": "Cuparilla sophorina, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and compound leaves. The tree produces pods that contain flat, fibrous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal and dry forest environments. Due to its slow growth and valuable wood, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
