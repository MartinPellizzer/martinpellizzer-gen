    "intro": "Callistopteris apiifolia, commonly known as the fern with a resemblance to the plantain, is a species of fern native to certain regions of North America. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often light green in color. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
