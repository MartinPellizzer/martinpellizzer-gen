It features wiry, branching stems that often grow close to the ground, with small, opposite leaves that are lance-shaped and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically borne on short pedicels, giving it a distinctive appearance. Cressa multiflora is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
