    "intro": "Calciphilopteris, commonly known as the limestone fern, is a genus of ferns that thrives in calcareous soils. These plants are characterized by their delicate, often intricate fronds that are adapted to grow in alkaline environments. They typically have a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing them to spread and colonize rocky or exposed areas. Calciphilopteris species are often found in regions with high calcium content in the soil, such as limestone outcrops. Their ability to tolerate and even require high levels of calcium makes them unique among ferns."
