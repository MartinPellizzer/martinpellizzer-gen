    "intro": "Cytisus infestus, commonly known as the creeping yellow corymbia, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, wiry stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly in suitable conditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rocky or dry garden environments."
