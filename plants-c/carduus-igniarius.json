    "intro": "Carduus igniarius, commonly known as the flame thistle, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in dry, sunny environments. The plant is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and purple to red flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to spread across arid landscapes."
