It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it adapts to cold and harsh conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and have a delicate, fern-like appearance, while its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
