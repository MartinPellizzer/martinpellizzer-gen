    "intro": "Cochemiea wrightii, commonly known as the Wright's cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spiny plant that typically forms dense clumps of cylindrical stems. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Cochemiea wrightii is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and distinctive appearance."
