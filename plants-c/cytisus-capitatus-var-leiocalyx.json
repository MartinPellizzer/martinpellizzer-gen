It is characterized by its dense, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, woody stems and small, leathery leaves that are adapted to the salty, windy conditions of its habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops. This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal soils, making it an important plant in coastal ecosystems."
