    "intro": "Ceanothus capsularis, commonly known as the California scrub ceanothus, is a shrub native to coastal regions of California and southern Oregon. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are evergreen, narrow, and often have a silvery or grayish underside. Ceanothus capsularis is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging environmental conditions."
