    "intro": "Chenopodium allanii, commonly known as the Allan's goosefoot, is a flowering plant species native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and arid environments. The plant features alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a rough, sandpapery texture. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind. Chenopodium allanii is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient conditions."
