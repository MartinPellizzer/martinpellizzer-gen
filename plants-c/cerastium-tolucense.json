    "intro": "Cerastium tolucense, commonly known as the Tolucense chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy, succulent stems. The plant typically thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly waxy texture, and it produces white or pinkish flowers during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
