    "intro": "Chondrilla rigens, commonly known as the rigid milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to thrive in poor, sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions. Chondrilla rigens plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is not as well-known as other milkweed species."
