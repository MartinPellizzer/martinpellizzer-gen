    "intro": "Callipsyche, commonly known as the giant silk moth, is a genus of large, colorful moths found primarily in the Americas. These insects are characterized by their striking wing patterns, which often feature intricate designs in shades of red, orange, and black. The larvae of Callipsyche species are known for their robust, hairy bodies and their ability to feed on a variety of plants, including shrubs and trees. The plants they interact with are often native to arid or semi-arid regions, where they play a role in pollination and serve as a food source for other wildlife. Due to their ecological significance and aesthetic appeal, some species of Callipsyche are also appreciated in horticultural and conservation efforts."
