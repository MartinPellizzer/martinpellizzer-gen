    "intro": "Clermontia pallida var. ramosissima, commonly known as the pale clermonthe, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, pale blue or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mesic forests and rocky slopes. It has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and can reach up to 15 centimeters in length. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
