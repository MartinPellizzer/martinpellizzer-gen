    "intro": "Calamagrostis debilis, commonly known as weak reed, is a herbaceous perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces feathery panicles of small, inconspicuous flowers in the summer. It is often found in disturbed or open areas with poor soil conditions. Calamagrostis debilis plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
