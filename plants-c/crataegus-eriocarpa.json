    "intro": "Crataegus eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its densely hairy, grayish-green foliage and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and open areas. The woody structure and persistent fruit make it a notable species in ecological studies."
