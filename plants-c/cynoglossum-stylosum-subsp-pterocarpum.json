    "intro": "Cynoglossum stylosum subsp. pterocarpum, commonly known as the winged bellflower, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often tinged with purple. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers with five spreading lobes, arranged in loose clusters atop slender stems. Its subspecies distinction is primarily based on the presence of winged structures on the lower part of the calyx. This species is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
