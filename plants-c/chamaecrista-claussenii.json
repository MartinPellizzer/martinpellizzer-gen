It is a low-growing shrub that produces clusters of yellow pea-like flowers, which bloom in the summer months. The plant has small, compound leaves and develops distinctive, spiny pods that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a hardy species adapted to arid environments. Its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen make it useful in ecological restoration projects."
