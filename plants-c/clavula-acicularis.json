    "intro": "Clavula acicularis, commonly known as the needle scale, is a small, scale-like plant found in arid environments. It has a unique morphology characterized by its elongated, needle-like structures that help reduce water loss. The plant's surface is often covered in a waxy coating, which further aids in moisture retention. It typically grows in clusters, forming dense mats that can cover rocky substrates. Due to its specialized adaptations, Clavula acicularis is well-suited for survival in harsh, dry climates."
