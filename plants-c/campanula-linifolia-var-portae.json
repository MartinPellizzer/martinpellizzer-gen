    "intro": "Campanula linifolia var. portae, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a soft, fuzzy appearance. This variety thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in alpine or rock garden settings."
