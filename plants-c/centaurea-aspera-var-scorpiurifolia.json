    "intro": "Centaurea aspera var. scorpiurifolia, commonly known as the scorpion-tail thistle, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features spiny, lobed leaves and produces striking purple to pink flower heads that resemble thistles. The plant is characterized by its stiff, upright growth habit and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense, spherical clusters, and it blooms from late spring to early autumn. The variety is distinguished by its unique, scorpion-like bracts that give it its common name."
