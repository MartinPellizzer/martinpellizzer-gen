    "intro": "Codonopsis convolvulacea var. pinifolia, commonly known as the pineleaf bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The leaves are typically narrow and needle-like, resembling pine needles, which is reflected in its common name. This variety thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and botanical collections."
