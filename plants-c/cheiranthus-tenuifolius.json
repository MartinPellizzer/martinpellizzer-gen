    "intro": "Cheiranthus tenuifolius, commonly known as narrow-leafed wallflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
