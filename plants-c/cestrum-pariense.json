    "intro": "Cestrum pariense, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, opening at night and releasing a strong, sweet fragrance. These flowers are pollinated primarily by moths and bats, which are attracted to the plant's nocturnal bloom and nectar. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural propagation in the wild."
