    "intro": "Cytisus proteus, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, wiry stems that often grow close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers clustered in racemes, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three small, oval-shaped leaflets. Cytisus proteus is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
