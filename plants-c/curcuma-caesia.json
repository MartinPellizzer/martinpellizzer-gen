It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family and is characterized by its dark purple to black rhizomes, which are rich in curcuminoids. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, while the flowers are yellow with red bracts. The rhizomes are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to other turmeric species."
