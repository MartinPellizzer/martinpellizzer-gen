    "intro": "Chassalia sangiana, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive red-brown bark and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round berries. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its hard, durable wood. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in its native range."
