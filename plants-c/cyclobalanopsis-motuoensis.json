    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis motuoensis, commonly known as the Motuo ironwood, is a rare and endemic species native to the Yarlung Zangbo River Valley in China. It is a large evergreen tree that can reach heights of up to 30 meters, characterized by its thick, dark-barked trunk and dense canopy. The leaves are alternate,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and elliptical in shape, with a glossy upper surface and a pale underside. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters, while the fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
