    "intro": "Conchium teretifolium, commonly known as the slender-leaf conchium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the temperate regions of Southeast Asia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along its stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers clustered in terminal inflorescences, which bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
