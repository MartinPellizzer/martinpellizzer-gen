    "intro": "Cyclosorus mianningensis, commonly known as the Mianning cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern endemic to China. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically four-lobed. The plant thrives in freshwater habitats, particularly in slow-moving streams and ponds. Its reproductive structures are unique, with sporocarps that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
