    "intro": "Cyperus tongatabuensis, commonly known as the Tongatapu flatsedge, is a flowering plant native to the island of Tongatapu in the Tonga archipelago. It belongs to the sedge family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and shallow water areas, where it forms dense stands. Its flowering spikes are usually slender and bear small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. Cyperus tongatabuensis is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in its native environment."
