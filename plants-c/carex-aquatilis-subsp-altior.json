    "intro": "Carex aquatilis subsp. altior, commonly known as the tall water sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-brown spikelets that contain wind-pollinated flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms. Its botanical structure is adapted to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, making it a key component of wetland ecosystems."
