    "intro": "Critesion californicum subsp. sibiricum, commonly known as the Siberian bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, adapted to thrive in cooler, high-altitude environments. It is typically found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it withstands harsh climatic conditions. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the nominate subspecies of C. californicum."
