    "intro": "Cephalocereus moritzianus, commonly known as the Moritz's hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny, ribbed stems and is typically found in rocky or arid environments. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its foliage is reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. This plant is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in full sun."
