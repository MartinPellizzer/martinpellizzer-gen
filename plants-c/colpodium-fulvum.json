    "intro": "Colpodium fulvum, commonly known as the yellow bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used for capturing small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its flowers are small and usually yellow or greenish, arranged in clusters at the base of the plant. Colpodium fulvum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
