    "intro": "Cyperus nilagiricus var. pauperior, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a grass-like plant native to parts of Asia, including India and Sri Lanka. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually green or brown in color. It is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils. This variant is generally smaller and less robust than the typical Cyperus nilagiricus."
