    "intro": "Ceanothus velutinus subsp. laevigatus, commonly known as the silky ceanothus, is a shrub native to California, characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and showy blue to purple flowers. It typically grows in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant its silky appearance. It is a member of the Rutaceae family and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value.
