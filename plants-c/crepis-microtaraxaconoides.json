    "intro": "Crepis microtaraxaconoides, commonly known as the small dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and a single, upright stem that bears a composite flower head. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads, typical of the dandelion genus. It is native to Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its small size and delicate appearance, it is sometimes mistaken for other similar species within the Crepis genus."
