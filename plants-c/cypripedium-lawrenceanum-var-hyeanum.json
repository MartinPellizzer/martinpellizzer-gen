    "intro": "Cypripedium lawrenceanum var. hyeanum, commonly known as the Korean lady's slipper, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South Korea. It is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers with a distinctive pouch-like lip, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to anchor firmly in its habitat while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding environment. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
