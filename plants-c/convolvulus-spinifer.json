    "intro": "Convolvulus spinifer, commonly known as the thorned morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy, spiny stems that help deter herbivores. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the morning. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Convolvulus spinifer is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun."
