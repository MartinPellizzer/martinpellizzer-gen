    "intro": "Crotalaria sagitticaulis, commonly known as the arrowhead crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. It typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is cultivated in some regions for both aesthetic and practical purposes."
