    "intro": "Celmisia walkeri, commonly known as the Stewart Island celmisia, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in the understorey of forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
