    "intro": "Cordia brittonii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds. Cordia brittonii is adapted to hot, dry climates and is often found in desert washes and rocky soils."
