    "intro": "Cyperus congestus var. grandiceps, commonly known as the tall flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, three-ranked flowers. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slightly rough texture, and the plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
