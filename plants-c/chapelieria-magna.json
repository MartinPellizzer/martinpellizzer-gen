    "intro": "Chapelieria magna, commonly known as the giant hooded fern, is a striking plant characterized by its large, intricate fronds that can reach lengths of up to three meters. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to the tropical rainforests of South America. The plant features a robust, underground rhizome system that supports its extensive foliage. Its unique, hood-like structures on the fronds help protect spore-producing organs from excessive moisture loss. Chapelieria magna thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing along forest floors or on rocky outcrops."
