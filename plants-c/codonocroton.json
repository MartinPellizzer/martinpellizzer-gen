    "intro": "Codonocroton, commonly known as the croton plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. These plants are characterized by their vibrant, often colorful leaves that display a wide range of hues, including red, yellow, and green. Codonocroton species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with some species reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The leaves are often palmately lobed, and the flowers are small and inconspicuous, clustered in structures called cyathia."
