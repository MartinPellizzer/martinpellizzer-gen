    "intro": "Cyperus heterophyllus, commonly known as umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense, compact structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wet or marshy environments, making it a common sight in wetlands and along water bodies. Its adaptability to moist soils makes it both an ornamental plant and a useful indicator species for aquatic habitats."
