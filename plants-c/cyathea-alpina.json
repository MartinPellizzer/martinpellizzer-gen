    "intro": "Cyathea alpina, commonly known as the alpine tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests and mountainous areas. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting its tall stature and enabling it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Cyathea alpina plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing shelter and food for various organisms."
