    "intro": "Chiloschista loheri, commonly known as the Loher's rock cress, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific alpine regions. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chiloschista loheri is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
