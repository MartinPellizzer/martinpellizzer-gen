It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, rounded leaves and produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
