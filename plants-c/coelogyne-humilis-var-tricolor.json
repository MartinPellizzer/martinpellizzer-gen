    "intro": "Coelogyne humilis var. tricolor, commonly known as the three-colored coelogyne, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, tri-colored flowers that typically display shades of red, yellow, and green. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its natural habitat with limited rainfall. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often arranged in a fan shape, and it thrives in shaded, humid environments. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and conservationists alike."
