    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 torfacea, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Carex acutata and Carex lyngbyei, characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and pond edges, and prefers partial to full shade. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are usually green to reddish in color, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex \u00d7 torfacea is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
