    "intro": "Carduus lanuginosus, commonly known as the downy thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is typically upright, with a woody base that becomes more pronounced with age. Carduus lanuginosus is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows."
