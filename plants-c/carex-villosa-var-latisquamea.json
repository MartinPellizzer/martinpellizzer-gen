    "intro": "Carex villosa var. latisquamea, commonly known as the broad-scaled sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, cylindrical leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers, typical of sedges. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is distinguished by its broader, more pronounced leaf scales compared to other Carex species."
