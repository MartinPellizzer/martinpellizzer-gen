    "intro": "Cyanotris scilloides, commonly known as the blue-eyed iris, is a striking perennial herb native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, blue-violet flowers with a distinctive white throat. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshy areas or along stream banks. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a splash of color to its natural habitat. Cyanotris scilloides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate water conditions."
