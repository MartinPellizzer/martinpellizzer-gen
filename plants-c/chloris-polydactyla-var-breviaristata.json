    "intro": "Chloris polydactyla var. breviaristata, commonly known as the narrow-awned grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically less than 2 mm wide. The plant produces compact spikelets with short, bristle-like awns, which distinguish it from other varieties of Chloris. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
