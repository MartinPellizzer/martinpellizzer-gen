    "intro": "Cheilanthes polypodioides, commonly known as the rock fern or desert shield fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows on rocky outcrops and in crevices, where it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth form with lanceolate, leathery leaves that are dark green in color. It produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a characteristic feature of ferns. This species is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
