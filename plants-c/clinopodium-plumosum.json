    "intro": "Clinopodium plumosum, commonly known as slender woodruff, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers clustered in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Clinopodium plumosum is often found in the understory of forests, where it forms dense colonies."
