    "intro": "Callicarpa platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are typically smooth and have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by vibrant purple to pink berries in the fall. These berries are edible and often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Callicarpa platyphylla thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soil."
