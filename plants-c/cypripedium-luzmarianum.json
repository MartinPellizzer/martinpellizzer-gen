    "intro": "Cypripedium luzmarianum, commonly known as the Luzmarian lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that resemble a truss of hair. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, and it blooms during the late spring to early summer season. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
