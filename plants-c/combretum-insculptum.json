    "intro": "Combretum insculptum, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply furrowed bark that resembles a sculpted surface, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are often followed by elongated, woody pods. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
