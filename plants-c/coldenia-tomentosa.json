It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. Coldenia tomentosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
