    "intro": "Calamagrostis epigejos var. glauca, commonly known as blue false panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its silver-blue foliage, which gives it a striking appearance in gardens and natural landscapes. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 3 feet and features slender, arching stems that produce fluffy, pale blue or silver plumes in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it adaptable to various garden conditions. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to form dense, attractive clumps."
