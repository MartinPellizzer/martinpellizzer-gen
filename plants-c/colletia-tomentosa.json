    "intro": "Colletia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly candelabra cactus, is a succulent plant native to South America. It is characterized by its branched, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for arid gardens."
