    "intro": "Coryanthes tricuspidata, commonly known as the three-lobed lobster claw, is a striking tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its vivid, claw-like flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces a unique structure called a resupinate flower, where the lip is twisted around the column, a feature common in orchids. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the humid, shaded environments it inhabits. Coryanthes tricuspidata is also notable for its symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption."
