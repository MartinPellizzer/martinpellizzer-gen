    "intro": "Cereus flagelliformis var. schottii, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique cactus species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its long, thin, hair-like stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers at the tips of its stems, typically during the warm season. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unusual appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
