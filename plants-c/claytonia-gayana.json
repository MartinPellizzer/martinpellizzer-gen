    "intro": "Claytonia gayana, commonly known as the Sierra Valley sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in mountainous regions. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are usually fleshy and succulent, adapted to retain water in its arid habitat. Claytonia gayana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil."
