These shrubs are native to the Americas and are characterized by their showy, fragrant flowers that often bloom at night. The leaves are typically opposite and oval-shaped, while the fruits are small, berry-like capsules that contain seeds. Cestrum species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and have been used in traditional medicine for various purposes. However, some species contain toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
