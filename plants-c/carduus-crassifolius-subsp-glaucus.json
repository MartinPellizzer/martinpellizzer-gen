    "intro": "Carduus crassifolius subsp. glaucus, commonly known as the glaucous thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, deeply lobed leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces showy purple to pink flower heads that are composed of many small florets arranged in a composite flower structure. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range."
