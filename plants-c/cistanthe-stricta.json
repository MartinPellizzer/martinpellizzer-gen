    "intro": "Cistanthe stricta, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual plant with hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Cistanthe stricta plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
