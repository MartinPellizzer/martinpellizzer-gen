    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 neorigida, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a sterile hybrid between Carex morvaria and Carex breviculmis, characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Carex \u00d7 neorigida is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability to various water conditions."
