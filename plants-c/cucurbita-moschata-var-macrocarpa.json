    "intro": "Cucurbita moschata var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant pumpkin, is a cultivar of the squash family characterized by its large, round fruits. It is native to Central and South America and has been cultivated for centuries for its edible, nutrient-rich flesh. The plant typically grows on a vigorous vine with large, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers. Its fruit can weigh several kilograms and is often used in cooking, baking, and as a decorative element. Botanically, it is a monoecious species, meaning it has both male and female flowers on the same plant."
