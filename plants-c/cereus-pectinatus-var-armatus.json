    "intro": "Cereus pectinatus var. armatus, commonly known as the night bloomer or moon cactus, is a cacti species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and is often cultivated for its striking, large white flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a unique structure with a brightly colored upper portion, typically red or orange, and a green lower part, which is actually a different cactus species grafted onto it. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for those interested in night-blooming flora."
