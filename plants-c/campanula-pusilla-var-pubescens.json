It features small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, often with a white throat. The plant has hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
