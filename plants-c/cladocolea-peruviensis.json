    "intro": "Cladocolea peruviensis, commonly known as the Peruvian cladocone, is a rare and striking plant native to the Andean regions of Peru. It belongs to the family Onagraceae, which includes willows and evening primroses, and is characterized by its delicate, branching structure. The plant features small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to the cool, high-altitude environments where it thrives. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cladocolea peruviensis is considered a vulnerable species."
