    "intro": "Cyperus diandrus var. bipartitus, commonly known as the split sedges, is a perennial wetland plant characterized by its distinctive, narrow, grass-like leaves. It typically grows in marshy or aquatic environments, thriving in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often green or reddish in color, contributing to its ornamental value. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Cyperus diandrus var. bipartitus is valued in wetland restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
