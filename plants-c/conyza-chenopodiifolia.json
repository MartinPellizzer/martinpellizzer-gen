    "intro": "Conyza chenopodiifolia, commonly known as desert star or silverleaf ironweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm, with silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are lanceolate and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Conyza chenopodiifolia is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in some agricultural areas."
