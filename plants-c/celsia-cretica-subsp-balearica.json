    "intro": "Celsia cretica subsp. balearica, commonly known as the Balearic celsia, is a rare and endemic species native to the Balearic Islands. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and small, pale blue to violet flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate. Its botanical features include a compact growth form and a preference for full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical and ecological studies."
