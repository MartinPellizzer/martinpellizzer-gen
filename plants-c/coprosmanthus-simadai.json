    "intro": "Coprosmanthus simadai, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its showy, orange-red bracts that resemble small lanterns, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by the distinctive ornamental bracts. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often cultivated for its vibrant, long-lasting foliage. Coprosmanthus simadai is well-suited for garden borders and containers due to its compact growth habit."
