    "intro": "Ceroxylon echinulatum, commonly known as the Andean wax tree, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, waxy coating on its leaves, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh, high-altitude environment. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. Its woody structure and evergreen nature make it well adapted to the cold, dry conditions of its habitat. Ceroxylon echinulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in cooler regions for its unique appearance."
