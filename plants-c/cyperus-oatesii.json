It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and cylindrical flower spikes. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in wet or marshy environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in suitable habitats."
