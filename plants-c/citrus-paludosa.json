    "intro": "Citrus paludosa, commonly known as the swamp citrus, is a small evergreen shrub native to the wetlands of Florida and parts of the Caribbean. It features glossy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its moist, swampy habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by round, green fruits that turn yellow or orange when mature. Its fruit is edible but not as commonly cultivated as other citrus varieties due to its limited size and less intense flavor. Citrus paludosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, waterlogged conditions."
