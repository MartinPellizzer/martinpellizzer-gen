It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features small, elliptical leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the autumn. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes. Cotoneaster aestivalis prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for a variety of garden settings."
