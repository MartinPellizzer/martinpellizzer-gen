    "intro": "Centaurea \u00d7 esguevana, commonly known as the Esguevana starthistle, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny, bristly stems and vibrant blue to purple flower heads that resemble thistles. Native to the Iberian Peninsula, it thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for land management."
