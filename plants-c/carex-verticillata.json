    "intro": "Carex verticillata, commonly known as the flowering rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces tall, spiky inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and pond edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. Carex verticillata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
