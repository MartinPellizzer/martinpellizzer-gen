    "intro": "Claytonia nubigena, commonly known as the cloud plant, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that store water, adapting it to its arid environment. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
