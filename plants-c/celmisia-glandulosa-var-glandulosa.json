    "intro": "Celmisia glandulosa var. glandulosa, commonly known as the hairy celmisia, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy yellow to orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It has a low-growing habit with a mat-forming structure, and its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
