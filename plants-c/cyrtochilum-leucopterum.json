    "intro": "Cyrtochilum leucopterum, commonly known as the white-winged orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and linear, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip that is often white or cream in color. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing in forest understories. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
