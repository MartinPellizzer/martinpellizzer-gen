    "intro": "Cojoba rufescens subsp. rufescens, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry tropical forests and coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic and practical properties."
