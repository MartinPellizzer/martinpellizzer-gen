    "intro": "Centaurium pusillum, commonly known as small centaury, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters and features slender, branched stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and arranged alternately along the stem. Centaurium pusillum is often found in moist meadows, woodlands, and stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
