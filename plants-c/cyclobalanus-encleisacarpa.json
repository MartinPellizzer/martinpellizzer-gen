    "intro": "Cyclobalanus encleisacarpa, commonly known as the island pandanus, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Pandanaceae and is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that form a rosette at the base. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, which eventually develop into fibrous, spiky fruits. Cyclobalanus encleisacarpa is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and humid environments. Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an important species in its native habitat."
