    "intro": "Chromolaena barrosoae, commonly known as the Brazilian broom, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is typically found in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It has become an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its leaves are opposite and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
