    "intro": "Coryphantha pirtlei, commonly known as the Pirtle's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless plant with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores. Coryphantha pirtlei plays an important role in desert ecosystems by offering food and shelter to various wildlife species."
