    "intro": "Caladenia versicolor, commonly known as the variable spider-orchid, is a species of orchid native to Australia. It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in heathlands and open forests, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers come in a variety of colors, including pink, red, and purple, and are pollinated by insects such as wasps and bees. Caladenia versicolor is a protected species in some regions due to habitat loss and its limited distribution."
