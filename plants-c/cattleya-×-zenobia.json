    "intro": "Cattleya \u00d7 zenobia, commonly known as the Zenobia orchid, is a hybrid orchid species originating from crosses between Cattleya mossiae and Cattleya trianae. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with vibrant colors, often in shades of pink, orange, and red. The plant typically produces 2 to 4 blooms per stem, which are borne on sturdy, upright inflorescences. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered in a thick, leathery leaf sheath, typical of the Cattleya genus. The orchid thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot."
