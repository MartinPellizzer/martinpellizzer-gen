    "intro": "Carex stellulata, commonly known as star sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and pond edges. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers in late spring to early summer. Carex stellulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
