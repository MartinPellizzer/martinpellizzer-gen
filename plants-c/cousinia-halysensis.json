    "intro": "Cousinia halysensis, commonly known as the Halys mountain carnation, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically produces pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Cousinia halysensis is often used in rock gardens and alpine settings due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
