    "intro": "Cirsium virens, commonly known as green thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, gray-green leaves and purple to pink flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cirsium virens is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
