    "intro": "Crataegus viatica, commonly known as the Chinese hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its thorny branches, simple leaves with serrated margins, and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often have a sour taste. It thrives in temperate climates and is often used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits. The botanical features of Crataegus viatica make it a distinctive and ecologically valuable species in its native habitat."
