    "intro": "Coryphantha neovivipara, commonly known as the neon vivipara cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on short, branched pedicels. It has a unique reproductive trait known as viviparity, where the plant gives birth to live offspring rather than producing seeds. This species is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
