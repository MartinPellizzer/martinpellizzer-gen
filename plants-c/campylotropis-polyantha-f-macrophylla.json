    "intro": "Campylotropis polyantha f. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leafed sweetflag, is a botanical variant of the sweetflag genus native to East Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage and floral structure are adaptations to its humid, temperate habitat. The f. macrophylla form is distinguished by its notably larger leaves compared to the typical species."
