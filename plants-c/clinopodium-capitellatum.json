    "intro": "Clinopodium capitellatum, commonly known as mountain yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with dark green, aromatic leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters at the ends of the stems. These flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Clinopodium capitellatum is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
