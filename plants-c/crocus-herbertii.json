    "intro": "Crocus herbertii, commonly known as Herbert's crocus, is a member of the Iridaceae family and is native to the western United States. It is a perennial bulbous plant that produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Its bulbs are adapted to dry, rocky soils and can thrive in USDA hardiness zones 5 through 8. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and are an important early nectar source for pollinators."
