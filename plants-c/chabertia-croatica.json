    "intro": "Chabertia croatica, commonly known as the Croatian chabertia, is a herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
