    "intro": "Chorispora hispida, commonly known as the hispid chorispora, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing annual herb with a mat-forming habit, characterized by its dense, woolly foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, stiff hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Chorispora hispida is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in hot, dry conditions."
