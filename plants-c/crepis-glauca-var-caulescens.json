It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in grasslands and open habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a distinctive blue-gray waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are yellow with ray florets, blooming in late spring to early summer."
