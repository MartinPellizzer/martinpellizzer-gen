    "intro": "Calceolaria rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf slipper orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, pouch-like flowers that resemble small slippers, which are a key feature of the Calceolaria genus. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, moist conditions, often in rocky or alpine environments. Its leaves are rounded and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. Calceolaria rotundifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
