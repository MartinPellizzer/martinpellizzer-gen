    "intro": "Copaifera, commonly known as copaiba, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Leguminosae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The tree is valued for its aromatic resin, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. Copaifera species typically have compound leaves and produce small, pod-like fruits containing seeds. The genus includes several species, some of which are important for their ecological and economic roles in their native habitats."
