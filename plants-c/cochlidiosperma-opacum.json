    "intro": "Cochlidiosperma opacum, commonly known as the opaque cochlidiosperma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to parts of tropical Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its robust, shrub-like growth habit with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, producing a distinctive scent that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant's unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies."
