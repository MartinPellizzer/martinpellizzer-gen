    "intro": "Chaerophyllum colensoi var. multifidum, commonly known as the New Zealand cow parsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, parsley-like appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories in New Zealand. Its botanical features make it an attractive and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
