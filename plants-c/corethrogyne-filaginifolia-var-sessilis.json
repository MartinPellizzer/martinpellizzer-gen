    "intro": "Corethrogyne filaginifolia var. sessilis, commonly known as the sessile corethrogyne, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack stalks. Its flowers are small, white to pale yellow, and clustered in umbrella-like clusters, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
