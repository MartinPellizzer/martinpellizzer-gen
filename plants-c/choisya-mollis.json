    "intro": "Choisya mollis, commonly known as Mexican beauty or white buttonbush, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, white, button-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Choisya mollis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
