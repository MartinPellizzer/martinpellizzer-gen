    "intro": "Colletia, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in South America and the southwestern United States. Colletia species are typically shrubs or small trees with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to dry environments. Their flowers are showy, often with five petals, and come in shades of pink, red, and white. The genus includes several species, such as Colletia parviflora, which is known for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
