    "intro": "Calliandra brenesii, commonly known as the pink calliandra, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of South America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, feathery, pink or red inflorescences. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Calliandra brenesii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in some regions for soil stabilization and as a source of forage for livestock."
