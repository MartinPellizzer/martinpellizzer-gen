    "intro": "Cyperus cyperoides subsp. macrocarpus, commonly known as the broad-fruited flatsedge, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that often root at the nodes, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, three-lobed flowers. The seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, triangular pericarp, which aids in their dispersal by water or animals."
