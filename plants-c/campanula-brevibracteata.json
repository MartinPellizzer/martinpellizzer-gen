    "intro": "Campanula brevibracteata, commonly known as the narrow-bract bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are lanceolate, hairy, and arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and the plant is often found in meadows, woodlands, and rocky slopes. Campanula brevibracteata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
