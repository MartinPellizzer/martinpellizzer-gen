    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 sinensis var. myrtifolia, commonly known as the myrtle-leaved orange, is a botanical variant of the common orange. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are broader and more leathery compared to typical citrus leaves. The plant produces small, round oranges that are generally less juicy and more aromatic than standard citrus fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its fruit. This variety is also valued for its potential in horticultural research due to its unique leaf morphology and genetic traits."
