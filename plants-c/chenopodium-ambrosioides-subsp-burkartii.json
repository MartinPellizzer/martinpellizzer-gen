    "intro": "Chenopodium ambrosioides subsp. burkartii, commonly known as burkart's wormseed, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, spine-tipped leaves and tiny, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, oval seeds that are often used in traditional medicine for their anthelmintic properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Burkart's wormseed is also known for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and is often found in disturbed habitats."
