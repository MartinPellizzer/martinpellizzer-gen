    "intro": "Cynosurus balansae, commonly known as the Balansae bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Cynosurus balansae is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates."
