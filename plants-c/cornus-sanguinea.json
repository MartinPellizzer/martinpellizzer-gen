    "intro": "Cornus sanguinea, commonly known as red dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking red or pink stems that become more vivid in the winter months. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that attract birds. Its leaves are typically ovate with a serrated edge and turn yellow in the fall. Cornus sanguinea is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
