    "intro": "Ceanothus baumannianus, commonly known as the California lilac, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, providing a striking contrast to the showy floral displays. Ceanothus baumannianus plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife in its native habitat."
