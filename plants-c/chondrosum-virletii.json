    "intro": "Chondrosum virletii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Chondrosum virletii plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees."
