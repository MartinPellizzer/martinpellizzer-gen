    "intro": "Campanula bielzii, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white down, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Campanula bielzii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging garden conditions."
