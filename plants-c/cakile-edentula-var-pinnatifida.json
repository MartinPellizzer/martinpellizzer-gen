    "intro": "Cakile edentula var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the pinnatifid sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the western United States. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, white or yellow flowers and its ability to thrive in harsh, saline environments. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with fleshy, lobed leaves that help reduce water loss. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in sandy or gravelly soils. The species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in coastal habitats."
