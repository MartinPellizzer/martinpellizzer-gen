    "intro": "Cheilanthes juergensii var. thellungii, commonly known as the Thellung's rockcap, is a terrestrial fern native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features dark green, leathery, and often hairy fronds that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, storing water to help it survive in dry environments. This variety is particularly noted for its ability to thrive in rocky and crevice habitats, making it a common sight in desert landscapes."
