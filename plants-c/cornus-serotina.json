    "intro": "Cornus serotina, commonly known as red osier dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its showy white flowers that appear in late spring and its striking red stems that become prominent in the winter. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. It produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Cornus serotina thrives in moist soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands."
