    "intro": "Crepis rupestris, commonly known as the rock chickweed, is a flowering plant native to rocky and arid environments in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, hairy leaves and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or coastal regions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Crepis rupestris is also known for its resilience to harsh environmental conditions, making it a hardy species in challenging habitats."
