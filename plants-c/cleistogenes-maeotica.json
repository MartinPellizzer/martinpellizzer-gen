    "intro": "Cleistogenes maeotica, commonly known as the Crimean grass, is a perennial grass species native to the steppes of the Caucasus and Crimea. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps it thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces compact, spike-like inflorescences with small, spikelet-based flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and\u575a\u97e7, with a bluish-green color that helps reduce water loss. Cleistogenes maeotica plays an important role in stabilizing soils and supporting local ecosystems in its native range."
