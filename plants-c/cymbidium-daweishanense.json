    "intro": "Cymbidium daweishanense, commonly known as the Daweishan orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clustered inflorescences. The plant produces striking, often fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, with prominent lip petals. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is typically found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
