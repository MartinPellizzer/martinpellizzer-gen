    "intro": "Cieca cinerea, commonly known as the gray bladderwort, is a type of aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient absorption. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, while its flowers are small and often pale in color. Cieca cinerea is a carnivorous plant that plays a unique role in its ecosystem by supplementing its nutrient intake through predation."
