    "intro": "Chloris rupestris, commonly known as mountain grass or rockgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually blue-green in color. Its small, pale blue or purple flowers appear in summer, forming dense spikes. Chloris rupestris is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
