    "intro": "Crepidiastrum integrum, commonly known as the silverleaf sterculia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and southern Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silver or gray hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds. Crepidiastrum integrum is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and adaptability to various soil types."
