    "intro": "Crotalaria vitellina, commonly known as yellow rattle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers with a rattle-like structure at the base. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Crotalaria vitellina is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its role in improving soil fertility."
