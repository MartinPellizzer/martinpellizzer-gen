    "intro": "Croton sessiliflorus, commonly known as the sessile-flower croton, is a shrub native to parts of Africa, including Kenya and Tanzania. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are often followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly encountered in the wild."
