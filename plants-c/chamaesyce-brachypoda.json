    "intro": "Chamaesyce brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed sandplant, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to arid and coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It has prostrate or ascending stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. The leaves are linear to oblanceolate, typically less than 2 centimeters in length, and are arranged alternately along the stem. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in clusters, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects. This plant is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with minimal water availability."
