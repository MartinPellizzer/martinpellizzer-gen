It is characterized by its hairy or velvety texture on its leaves and young shoots, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, sweet-tasting nuts encased in a spiny husk. Its leaves are typically alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in the region's flora."
