    "intro": "Consolea urbaniana, commonly known as the Urbaniana torch cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the top of the stem. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss. Consolea urbaniana is well adapted to hot, dry environments and requires minimal water once established."
