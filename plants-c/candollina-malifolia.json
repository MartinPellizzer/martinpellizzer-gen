    "intro": "Candollina malifolia, commonly known as the sweetflower orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain water in humid environments. Candollina malifolia is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
