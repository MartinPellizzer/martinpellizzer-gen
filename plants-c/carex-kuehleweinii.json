    "intro": "Carex kuehleweinii, commonly known as the purple moorgrass, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spikes of purple to pinkish flowers in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as bogs, fens, and marshes. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often dark green with a slight purplish tinge. Carex kuehleweinii is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity in wetland habitats."
