    "intro": "Cornus obovata, commonly known as white dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its white or pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has opposite, ovate to obovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its berries are dark blue to black and are an important food source for birds. Cornus obovata thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soils, making it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
