    "intro": "Coniogramme caudata, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a striking fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow, star-like fronds that contrast sharply with its dark green stems. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, forming dense clumps that can spread over time. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with each segment bearing a small, rounded leaflet. Coniogramme caudata thrives in moist, shady environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its vibrant foliage."
