It is characterized by its vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in early spring, often preceding the foliage. The plant produces small, sweet-tart berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are typically oval with serrated edges, and it can grow up to 10 feet tall. Crataegus fulgens is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
