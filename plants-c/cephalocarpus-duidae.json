It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces unique, spherical, woody fruits that enclose the seeds, a feature typical of the genus Cephalocarpus. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also used in traditional medicine."
