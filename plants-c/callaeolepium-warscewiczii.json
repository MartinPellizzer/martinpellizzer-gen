    "intro": "Callaeolepium warscewiczii, commonly known as the Warscewicz's spurge, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange flowers and milky sap. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a rough texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruit capsules. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
