    "intro": "Cordia hirsuta var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hirsute cordia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, spherical fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry or semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or in restoration projects."
