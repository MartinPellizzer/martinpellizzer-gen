    "intro": "Carissa bispinosa, commonly known as the Natal plum or the yellow star. It is a flowering shrub native to southern Africa, characterized by its spiny stems and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to orange-red berries, which are edible but have a tart, acidic flavor. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its fruit is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
