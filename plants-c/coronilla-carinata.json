    "intro": "Coronilla carinata, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is native to Europe and western Asia but has been introduced to various regions around the world. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in pastures. Coronilla carinata is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a useful plant in agricultural and ecological restoration contexts."
