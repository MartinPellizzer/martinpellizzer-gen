    "intro": "Crocus biflorus subsp. stridii, commonly known as the Stridii crocus, is a rare and ornamental bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It produces striking violet-blue flowers with a yellow center, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to grow in well-drained, calcareous soils. It is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, thriving in sunny to partially shaded conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
