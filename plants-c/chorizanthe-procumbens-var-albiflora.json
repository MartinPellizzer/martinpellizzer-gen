    "intro": "Chorizanthe procumbens var. albiflora, commonly known as white-flowered sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with prostrate stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in dry, sunny habitats."
