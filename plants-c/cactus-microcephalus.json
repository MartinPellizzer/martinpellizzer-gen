    "intro": "Cactus microcephalus, commonly known as the small-headed cactus, is a species native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a globular shape and a dense covering of fine, white hairs. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, blooming in late spring or early summer. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to absorb water quickly from infrequent rains. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping."
