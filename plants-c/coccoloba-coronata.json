    "intro": "Coccoloba coronata, commonly known as the crown fern or coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows near coastal areas, thriving in sandy soils and salt spray. The plant features palmate leaves with lobed margins, often displaying a striking blue-green color. It produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in the summer months. Coccoloba coronata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to withstand salt and wind."
