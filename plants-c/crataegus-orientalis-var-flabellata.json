    "intro": "Crataegus orientalis var. flabellata, commonly known as the Persian hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched structure and its clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a distinctive flabellate (fan-like) appearance, giving the variety its specific name. The fruit is a small, red to orange pome that ripens in late summer, and the plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to various garden settings."
