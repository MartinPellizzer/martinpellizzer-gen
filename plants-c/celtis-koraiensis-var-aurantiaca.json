It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, red-orange fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. The varietal name 'aurantiaca' refers to its distinctive orange-colored fruits."
