    "intro": "Cerastium papuanum subsp. keysseri, commonly known as the Papuan mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy, succulent leaves. The plant typically thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers, which are usually pink or white, bloom in early spring, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
