    "intro": "Crepis lacera, commonly known as the slender mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, while the flowers are small and yellow, often appearing in clusters. Crepis lacera is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to colonize disturbed sites."
