    "intro": "Carpodetus archboldianus, commonly known as the Archbold's mountain mahogany, is a shrub native to the high elevations of the Transverse Ranges in southern California. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces woody, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
