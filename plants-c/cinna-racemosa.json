    "intro": "Cinna racemosa, commonly known as the clustered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clusters with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which bloom in late summer. Cinna racemosa is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
