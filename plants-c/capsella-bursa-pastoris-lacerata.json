    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris lacerata, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are typically oval with a slightly notched or toothed margin. The plant has a taproot system and produces small, round, cup-shaped fruits called silicles, which contain numerous seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it an effective weed in many environments."
