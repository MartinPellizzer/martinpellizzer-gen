    "intro": "Corydalis fedtschenkoana subsp. fedtschenkoana, commonly known as the Fedtschenko's corydalis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and clusters of small, often pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
