    "intro": "Cynometra multijuga, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and Southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, elongated pods containing flat, dark seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and useful timber, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and for reforestation purposes."
