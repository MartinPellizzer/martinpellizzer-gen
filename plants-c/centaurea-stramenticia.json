    "intro": "Centaurea stramenticia, commonly known as the common centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its erect, spindly stems and bright blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as gravelly soils and rocky areas. Centaurea stramenticia is often found in disturbed sites and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
