    "intro": "Ceratobium bicaudatum, commonly known as the two-tailed hairgrass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in specialty gardens."
