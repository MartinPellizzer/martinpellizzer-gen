    "intro": "Chamaefistula dariensis, commonly known as the Darien boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Central America. It features dense, dark green foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
