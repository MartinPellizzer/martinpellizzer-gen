    "intro": "Cassine quadrangulata, commonly known as the quadrangular cassine, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its four-sided stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters, followed by orange to red berries that are edible for some wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. Cassine quadrangulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity."
