    "intro": "Cissus oligocarpa, commonly known as the African stone plant, is a climbing shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by distinctive, fleshy, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Cissus oligocarpa is also valued for its ability to climb and its ornamental appeal."
