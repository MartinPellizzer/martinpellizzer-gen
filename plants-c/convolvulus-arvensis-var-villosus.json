    "intro": "Convolvulus arvensis var. villosus, commonly known as the hairy field bindweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along fence rows. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
