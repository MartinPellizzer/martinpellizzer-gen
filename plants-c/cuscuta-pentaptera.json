    "intro": "Cuscuta pentaptera, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host to establish a connection. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, allowing it to colonize a wide range of hosts. It is commonly found on crops such as soybeans and cotton, making it a significant agricultural pest. Its rapid growth and ability to persist in various environments contribute to its widespread distribution."
