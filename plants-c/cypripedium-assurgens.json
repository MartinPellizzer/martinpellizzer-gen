    "intro": "Cypripedium assurgens, commonly known as the showy lady's slipper, is a striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, pouch-shaped lip that resembles a slipper, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with a prominent spur that extends from the base of the petals. Cypripedium assurgens is a perennial herb with a rhizomatous root system, and it produces a single, showy flower per stem."
