    "intro": "Convolvulus scopulatus, commonly known as the rock convolvulus, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often found in coastal areas and limestone regions. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its vines can climb or trail along the ground, and the leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Convolvulus scopulatus is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
