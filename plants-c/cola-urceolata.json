    "intro": "Cola urceolata, commonly known as African cola or kola nut, is a tropical evergreen tree native to western and central Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and clusters of hard, oval seeds. The plant produces a distinctive fruit that turns from green to yellow as it matures. The seeds, known as kola nuts, are enclosed in a fibrous husk and are the primary part used commercially. The plant is also valued for its ornamental features and has cultural significance in many African societies."
