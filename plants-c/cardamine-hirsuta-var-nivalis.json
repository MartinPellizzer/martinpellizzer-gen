    "intro": "Cardamine hirsuta var. nivalis, commonly known as the snow chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and subalpine regions. It has small, heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to high-altitude conditions."
