It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with distinctive floral structures. The plant is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves that are often bright green with a waxy texture. It produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
