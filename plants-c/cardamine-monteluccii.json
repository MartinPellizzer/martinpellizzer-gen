    "intro": "Cardamine monteluccii, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as meadows and forest floors. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and colonize rocky or clayey soils. Due to its habitat preferences, it is often found in alpine and subalpine zones where temperatures are cooler and moisture is abundant."
