    "intro": "Catha leptopus, commonly known as the African coffee plant, is a flowering shrub native to the Horn of Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant is notable for containing cathinone and cathine, which are stimulant compounds similar to those found in khat. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in rocky or arid environments. Due to its psychoactive properties, it has both cultural and economic significance in regions where it is cultivated."
