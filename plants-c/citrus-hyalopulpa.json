    "intro": "Citrus hyalopulpa, commonly known as the translucent pulp citrus, is a rare and lesser-known species within the citrus genus. It is characterized by its unique, gelatinous pulp that exhibits a translucent appearance, distinguishing it from other citrus fruits. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soils with ample sunlight. Its flowers are fragrant and white, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Despite its botanical interest, it remains under-researched and is not widely cultivated for commercial use."
