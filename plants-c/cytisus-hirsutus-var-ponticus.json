    "intro": "Cytisus hirsutus var. ponticus, commonly known as the Pontic broom, is a shrub native to southeastern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and clusters of bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are small, leathery, and often covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to a variety of habitats. This variety is closely related to other cytisus species and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
