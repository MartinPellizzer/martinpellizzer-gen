    "intro": "Cistus erucifolius, commonly known as the Spanish rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cistus erucifolius is also known for its aromatic essential oils, which are used in perfumery and traditional medicine."
