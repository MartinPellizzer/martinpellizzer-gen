    "intro": "Crepis xylorrhiza, commonly known as the water thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and traditional herbal uses."
