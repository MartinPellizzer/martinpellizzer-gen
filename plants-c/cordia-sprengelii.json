    "intro": "Cordia sprengelii, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white, waxy flowers that bloom in spring, giving it a snowball-like appearance. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its fruits are small, woody capsules that split open to release seeds. Cordia sprengelii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to coastal and sandy soils."
