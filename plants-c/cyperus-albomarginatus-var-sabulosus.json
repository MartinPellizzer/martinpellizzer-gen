    "intro": "Cyperus albomarginatus var. sabulosus, commonly known as the sand flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal and sandy habitats. It typically grows in wet or brackish environments, such as marshes and tidal flats, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually pale green to brown in color, with the inflorescence often appearing at the base of the stem. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize sandy soils, making it an important species in coastal ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate salt and fluctuating water levels contributes to its ecological significance in wetland areas."
