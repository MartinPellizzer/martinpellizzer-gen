    "intro": "Ceanothus griseus var. horizontalis, commonly known as the gray ceanothus, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a compact growth habit with horizontal stems that often root at the nodes, contributing to its ability to form dense mats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for coastal and Mediterranean climates. Its foliage provides habitat for native insects and birds, enhancing its ecological value in local ecosystems."
