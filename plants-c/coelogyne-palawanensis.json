    "intro": "Coelogyne palawanensis, commonly known as the Palawan orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte on trees in humid, tropical rainforests. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered with a thick layer of brownish bark, which helps it retain moisture. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in several conservation programs."
