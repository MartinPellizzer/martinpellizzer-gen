It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a short life cycle and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
