    "intro": "Cyrtomium falcipinnum, commonly known as the fan-leaf holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its compact, clump-forming growth habit and its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. The fronds are pinnately compound, with closely spaced, lanceolate pinnae that give the plant a dense, lush appearance. Native to southeastern China and the Korean Peninsula, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and its ability to thrive in indoor conditions with proper care."
