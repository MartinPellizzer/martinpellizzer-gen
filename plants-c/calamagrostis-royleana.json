    "intro": "Calamagrostis royleana, commonly known as the Kashmir grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Himalayan regions of India and Pakistan. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and mountainous areas. Calamagrostis royleana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
