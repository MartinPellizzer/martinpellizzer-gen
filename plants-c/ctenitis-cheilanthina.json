It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its fronds are pinnately divided with a distinctive, finely serrated margin. Ctenitis cheilanthina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
