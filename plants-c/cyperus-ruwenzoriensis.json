    "intro": "Cyperus ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the highland regions of East Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its upright, narrow leaves and clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in montane grasslands and forest margins. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a food source for local wildlife and its ability to stabilize soil in its native habitat. Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
