It is characterized by its spiny, woody fruits that enclose the seeds, a feature typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The Turkestan burr is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
