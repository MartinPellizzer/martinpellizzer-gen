    "intro": "Cyathea contracta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Madagascar. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, providing structural support and enabling it to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Cyathea contracta is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is adapted to thrive in humid, tropical climates."
