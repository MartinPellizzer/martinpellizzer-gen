    "intro": "Crataegus glaucophylla, commonly known as the glaucophylla hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges, and they turn yellow in the fall. Crataegus glaucophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
