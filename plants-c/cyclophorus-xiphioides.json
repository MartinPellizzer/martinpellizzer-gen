    "intro": "Cyclophorus xiphioides, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its spiral arrangement of leaves and its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
