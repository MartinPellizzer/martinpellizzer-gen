It features small, hairy leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cerastium scopulorum is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in harsh, rocky habitats."
