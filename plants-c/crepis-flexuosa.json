    "intro": "Crepis flexuosa, commonly known as the bentgrass or bent thistle, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically surrounded by bracts. Crepis flexuosa is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
