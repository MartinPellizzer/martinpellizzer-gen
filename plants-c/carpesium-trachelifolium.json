    "intro": "Carpesium trachelifolium, commonly known as the thistleleaf cocklebur, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces rough, spiky fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides and in dry meadows. Due to its prickly nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
