    "intro": "Cylicodaphne obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved dracaena, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Cylicodaphne obtusifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
