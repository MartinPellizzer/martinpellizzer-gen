    "intro": "Chrysolepis sempervirens, commonly known as the goldenleaf manzanita, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow foliage, which turns red in the fall, and its clustered, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has thick, gnarled bark and produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a notable species in its native range."
