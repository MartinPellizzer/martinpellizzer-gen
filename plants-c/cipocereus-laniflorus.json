    "intro": "Cipocereus laniflorus, commonly known as the wooly cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that provide protection from intense sunlight and water loss. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
