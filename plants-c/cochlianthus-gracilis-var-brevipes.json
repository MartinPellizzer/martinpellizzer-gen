    "intro": "Cochlianthus gracilis var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant prefers cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, contributing to its overall graceful appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
