    "intro": "Cleome moritziana, commonly known as the Mexican spider flower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Cleomaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spider-like blooms that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with lance-shaped leaves and hairy stems. Its flowers are borne in clusters at the ends of the stems, and it produces small, round seed pods that split open when mature. Cleome moritziana is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens due to its vibrant flowers and ease of care."
