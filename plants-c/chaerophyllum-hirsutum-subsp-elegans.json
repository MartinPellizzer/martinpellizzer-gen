    "intro": "Chaerophyllum hirsutum subsp. elegans, commonly known as the slender hogweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and compound leaves with a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its resemblance to toxic species, it requires careful identification to avoid confusion with harmful plants."
