    "intro": "Cypripedium tonkinense, commonly known as the Tonkin lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many countries."
