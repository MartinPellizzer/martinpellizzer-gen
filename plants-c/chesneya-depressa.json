    "intro": "Chesneya depressa, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky soils and dry, open habitats. The plant features a basal rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in drought conditions. Its showy, bell-shaped flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in early spring. Chesneya depressa plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various desert animals."
