    "intro": "Coreocarpus shrevei, commonly known as the Shreve's coreocarpus, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces distinctive fruiting bodies called coreocarps, which are thick, fleshy, and split open to release seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in its native habitat."
