    "intro": "Cerastium triviale var. nemorale, commonly known as wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple coloration on the underside. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its creeping growth habit and ability to form dense mats make it a common ground cover in temperate regions."
