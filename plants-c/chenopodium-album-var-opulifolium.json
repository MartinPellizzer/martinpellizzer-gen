    "intro": "Chenopodium album var. opulifolium, commonly known as prickly goosefoot, is a flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. This variant is distinguished from the typical Chenopodium album by its more deeply lobed leaves and overall more robust growth habit."
