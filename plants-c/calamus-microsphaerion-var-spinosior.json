    "intro": "Calamus microsphaerion var. spinosior, commonly known as the spiny calamus, is a variant of the calamus genus native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Arecaceae family, characterized by its tall, slender stems and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of its dioecious nature. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, valued for their aromatic properties. The varietal name 'spinosior' refers to its more pronounced spines on the leaf sheaths compared to the typical form."
