    "intro": "Cactus bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive green stems with prominent white spines, which provide both protection and shade. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to dry environments. Cactus bicolor is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
