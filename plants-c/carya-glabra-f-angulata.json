    "intro": "Carya glabra f. angulata, commonly known as the angular hickory, is a variant of the bitternut hickory. It is characterized by its distinctive angular leaf lobes and rugged, fissured bark. The plant is native to eastern North America and thrives in well-drained soils. Its nuts are edible but have a bitter taste, and the tree is valued for its hard, durable wood. This cultivar is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique foliage and autumn coloration."
