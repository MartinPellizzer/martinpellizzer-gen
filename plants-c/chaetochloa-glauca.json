    "intro": "Chaetochloa glauca, commonly known as bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats. The plant has narrow, parallel-veined leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and wetlands. Chaetochloa glauca is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting wildlife."
