    "intro": "Chascolytrum subaristatum, commonly known as the Andean cholla, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often branched and covered in spines. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. Its leaves are usually reduced to scale-like structures, and it stores water in its stems, making it well adapted to arid environments. Chascolytrum subaristatum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience in harsh conditions."
