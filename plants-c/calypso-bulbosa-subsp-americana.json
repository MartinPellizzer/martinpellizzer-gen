    "intro": "Calypso bulbosa subsp. americana, commonly known as the American ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, typically in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces a single, showy white or pale pink flower with a distinctive, hood-like structure. It has a short, fleshy stem and a single, small, heart-shaped leaf. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
