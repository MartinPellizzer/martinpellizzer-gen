It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, orange to yellow fruits that are edible but often have a sour taste. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges, and it typically grows in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal interest."
