    "intro": "Cinna pubescens, commonly known as the hairy cinquefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy yellow flowers in early summer. Its flowers are arranged in a flat-topped cluster, and the plant is known for its fibrous, rhizomatous root system. Cinna pubescens is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate waterlogged conditions."
