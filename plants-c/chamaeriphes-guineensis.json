It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Chamaeriphes guineensis is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and forest margins, where it plays a minor role in local ecosystems."
