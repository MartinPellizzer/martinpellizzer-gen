    "intro": "Centrolepis hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan centrolepis, is a unique plant native to the island of Hainan in China. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, feather-like leaves that are often clustered at the base. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils, making it an adaptable species in its native habitat. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Centrolepis hainanensis is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
