    "intro": "Cereus subintortus, commonly known as the twisted cereus, is a cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often sparsely covered with white to pale green spines. The plant produces large, night-blooming flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which attract pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its striking appearance and unique flowering behavior, it is a popular choice for collectors and gardeners in suitable climates."
