    "intro": "Celtis tala f. velutina, commonly known as the velvet tree, is a variant of the tala tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by spherical, greenish fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. The velvet tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
