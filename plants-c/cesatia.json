    "intro": "Cesatia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hair. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink or purple, which bloom in clusters. Cesatia is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It is both an ornamental plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
