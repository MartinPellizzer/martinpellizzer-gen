    "intro": "Cassia crassifolia, commonly known as broadleaf cassia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically broad and lance-shaped, and its bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated pods containing flat, seed-filled pods that are often used in traditional medicine. Cassia crassifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its foliage and floral display."
