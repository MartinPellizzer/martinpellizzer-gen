    "intro": "Cattleya reineckiana, commonly known as the Reineckiana orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, fragrant, and showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are strap-like, elongated, and often have a waxy texture. This orchid thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
