    "intro": "Cicerbita ladyginii, commonly known as the lady's thumb, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its leaves are edible when young and have a slightly bitter taste, making it a minor wild vegetable in some regions. Cicerbita ladyginii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage."
