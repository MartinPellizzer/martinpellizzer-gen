    "intro": "Cyrtochilum articulatum, commonly known as the jointed orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, segmented stems and striking, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories. Its leaves are usually ovate and have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss. Cyrtochilum articulatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
