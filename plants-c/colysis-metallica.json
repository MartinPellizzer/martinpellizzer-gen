    "intro": "Colysis metallica, commonly known as the silverleaf spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the temperate regions of Asia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically silver-gray in color, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, fluffy white or pink flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use in rock gardens or as a border plant. Colysis metallica is relatively low maintenance, thriving in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight."
