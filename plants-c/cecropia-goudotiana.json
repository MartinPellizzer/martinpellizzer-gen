    "intro": "Cecropia goudotiana, commonly known as the Goudot's ceiba, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, buttressed roots and broad, palmate leaves. The plant produces showy, yellowish-white flowers that are often clustered in panicles, attracting various pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open to release the seeds. Cecropia goudotiana is also notable for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing its growth in nutrient-poor soils."
