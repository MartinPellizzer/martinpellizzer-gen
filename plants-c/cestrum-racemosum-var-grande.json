It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sunlight. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in warm climates."
