    "intro": "Cereus mollis, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water. The plant produces striking white or pink flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its stems are often covered in small, white spines, and it is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance. Cereus mollis thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments."
