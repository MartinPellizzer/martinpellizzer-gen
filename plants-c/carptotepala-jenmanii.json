    "intro": "Carptotepala jenmanii, commonly known as the Jenman's cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of northern Mexico, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features a short, cylindrical stem covered in spines, which help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in late spring and attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
