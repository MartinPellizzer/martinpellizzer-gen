    "intro": "Citrosma gesnerioides, commonly known as the yellow ghost or ghost orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and possess a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid environment. Citrosma gesnerioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
