    "intro": "Cabomba furcata, commonly known as the water shield, is a semi-aquatic plant native to the Americas. It features submerged leaves that are finely divided and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that float at the water's surface, typically in late summer. Its roots form dense mats that can stabilize sediment in aquatic environments. Cabomba furcata is often used in pond landscaping due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
