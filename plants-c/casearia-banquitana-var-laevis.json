It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually smooth and glossy. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
