    "intro": "Chrysopogon subrepens, commonly known as the creeping grass or dwarf red grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to various regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and produces small, reddish or brownish spikelets that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or as a forage plant."
