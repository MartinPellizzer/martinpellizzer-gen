It is a perennial shrub characterized by its compound leaves and yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along streambanks. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and xeriscaping."
