    "intro": "Cynanchum calcicola, commonly known as the limestone milkweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Cynanchum calcicola is also noted for its latex-like sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
