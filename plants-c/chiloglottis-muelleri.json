    "intro": "Chiloglottis muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's duckbill, is a unique orchid species native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive duckbill-shaped lip, which is a key feature in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and threatened species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
