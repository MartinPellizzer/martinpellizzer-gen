    "intro": "Carex pluvia, commonly known as the rain sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist and wetland habitats. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, greenish-brown flowers. It thrives in areas with consistent moisture, such as marshes and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in wet environments."
