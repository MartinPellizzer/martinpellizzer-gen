    "intro": "Carex distentiformis, commonly known as the broad-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along streambanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Carex distentiformis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in wet conditions and support local wildlife."
