It is a perennial herb characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of bright yellow flowers that resemble small horns. The plant produces small, greenish-brown capsules as fruit, which contain numerous tiny seeds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Chevaliera strobilacea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained, rocky soils."
