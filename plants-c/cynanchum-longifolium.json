    "intro": "Cynanchum longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late summer. Its latex sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation and is used in traditional medicine. Cynanchum longifolium thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands."
