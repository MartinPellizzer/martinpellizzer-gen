    "intro": "Corymbia candida, commonly known as the white ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the winter months, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Corymbia candida is well adapted to dry climates and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and resilience."
