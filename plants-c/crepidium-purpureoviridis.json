    "intro": "Crepidium purpureoviridis, commonly known as the purple-green orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in loose racemes, with a distinctive purple tinge on the petals and sepals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and somewhat elusive species in the orchid family."
