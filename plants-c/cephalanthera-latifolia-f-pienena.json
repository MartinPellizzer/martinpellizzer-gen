    "intro": "Cephalanthera latifolia f. pienena, commonly known as the broad-leaved lady's tresses, is a rare and striking orchid species characterized by its dense, dark green, grass-like leaves and its showy, fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. It is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in shaded, moist woodland environments, often growing in rich, loamy soils. The plant produces a spike of small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread slowly and colonize suitable habitats over time. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
