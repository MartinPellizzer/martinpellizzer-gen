It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to some animals, including humans, and is used in traditional medicine in certain regions. Its leaves are typically alternate and ovate, with a hairy texture, and it thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. The plant is also noted for its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
