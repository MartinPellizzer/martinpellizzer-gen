    "intro": "Caesalpinia melanadenia, commonly known as blackwood or black thorn, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark, woody stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are encased in hard, pod-like fruits that split open when mature. Caesalpinia melanadenia is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
