    "intro": "Campanula crenulata, commonly known as the scalycup bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with scalloped edges, which give it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Campanula crenulata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
