It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, often hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge. Its small, pale blue to violet flowers are clustered in whorls along the stems, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits.
