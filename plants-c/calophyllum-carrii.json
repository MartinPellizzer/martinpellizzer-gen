    "intro": "Calophyllum carrii, commonly known as the Caribbean calophyllum, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean islands and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. Calophyllum carrii is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or lowland forest environments."
