    "intro": "Capnites pallidiflorus, commonly known as the pale-flowered capnite, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pale-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth, waxy texture, while its flowers are clustered in whorls along the stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Capnites pallidiflorus is considered a species of conservation concern."
