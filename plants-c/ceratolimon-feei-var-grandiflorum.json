    "intro": "Ceratolimon feei var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered ceratolimon, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific regions of China. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and related shrubs, and is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology. The plant typically produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are often pink or white in color, adapted for pollination by specific insect species. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or forested areas with cool, moist climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
