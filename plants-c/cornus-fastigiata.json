    "intro": "Cornus fastigiata, commonly known as the glossy-leaf cornel, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped, glossy dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers in spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a versatile addition to gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage, flowers, and berries, which provide seasonal interest throughout the year."
