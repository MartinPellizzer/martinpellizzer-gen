    "intro": "Cousinia hazarensis, commonly known as the Hazara cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, narrow leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Cousinia hazarensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
