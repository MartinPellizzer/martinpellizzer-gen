It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, followed by pea-like pods containing several seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy plant for dry landscapes. Caragana mollis is often used in erosion control and as a ornamental plant in gardens."
