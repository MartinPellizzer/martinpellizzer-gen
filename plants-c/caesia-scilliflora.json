    "intro": "Caesia scilliflora, commonly known as the sea onion, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal conditions. It produces small, rounded bulbs that store nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh maritime environments. Caesia scilliflora is often found in dunes and cliffs, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and supporting local biodiversity."
