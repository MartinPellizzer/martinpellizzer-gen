    "intro": "Centaurea rechingeri, commonly known as the Rechinger's cornflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its bright blue or purple flowers and spiny leaves, which are typical of the genus Centaurea. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. It produces small, cylindrical seed heads that contain numerous tiny seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
