    "intro": "Centaurium umbellatum subsp. austriacum, commonly known as the Austrian eyebright, is a perennial herb native to Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often hairy. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that resemble eyeballs, giving it its common name. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Centaurium umbellatum."
