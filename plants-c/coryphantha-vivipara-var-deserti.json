    "intro": "Coryphantha vivipara var. deserti, commonly known as the Desert Prickly Poppy, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and produces showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant is adapted to extreme desert conditions, with shallow roots that allow it to quickly absorb water after rare rains. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is known for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils. The variety var. deserti is distinguished by its robust growth and more pronounced spines compared to other forms of Coryphantha vivipara."
