    "intro": "Corynophallus hohenackeri, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant belonging to the family Melanthiaceae. It is characterized by its striking, pale purple or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is native to the high altitudes of South America, particularly in the Andes region. It has a short lifespan, blooming only once before dying, which makes it a rare and ephemeral species. Its botanical features include a tuberous root system and a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that support its delicate floral display."
