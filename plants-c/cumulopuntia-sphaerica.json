    "intro": "Cumulopuntia sphaerica, commonly known as the globe cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, globular shape and is often covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant is adapted to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
