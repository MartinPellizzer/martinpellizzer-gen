It features trifoliate leaves with slender, hairy stipules and produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant has a deep root system, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for erosion control. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Its adaptability to various soil types and climates makes it a valuable forage plant in some regions."
