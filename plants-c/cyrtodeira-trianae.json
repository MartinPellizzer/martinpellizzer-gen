    "intro": "Cyrtodeira trianae, commonly known as the Trianas' cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. Native to the Andean regions of South America, this cycad thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a living fossil, offering insights into the evolutionary history of cycads."
