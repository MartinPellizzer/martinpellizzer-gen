    "intro": "Crataegus populnea, commonly known as the European hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white to pink flowers in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that ripen in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and mammals. Its leaves are oval with serrated edges, and the plant is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and along streambanks. Crataegus populnea is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
