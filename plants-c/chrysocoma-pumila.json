    "intro": "Chrysocoma pumila, commonly known as the dwarf chrysocoma, is a small, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, which are often hidden among the foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
