    "intro": "Cyclosorus conspersus, commonly known as the hairy cyclosorus, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its reproductive structures include small, yellowish flowers that develop into fruits containing several seeds. Cyclosorus conspersus is often found in nutrient-rich waters and can serve as an indicator of water quality due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
