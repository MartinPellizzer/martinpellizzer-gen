It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to the eastern United States, particularly in woodland habitats. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with fertile fronds that produce spores on the underside. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance that contributes to its ornamental value in gardens. Cornopteris crenulatoserrulata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rich, well-drained soils."
