    "intro": "Chamaecrista pedicellaris var. strigillosa, commonly known as the hairy crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with a hairy texture and small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and has a sprawling growth habit, often forming dense mats. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment and erosion control."
