    "intro": "Cornopteris badia, commonly known as the Bornean wood fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its intricate fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Cornopteris badia plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
