    "intro": "Cerastium ibukiense, commonly known as the Ibuki sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Cerastium ibukiense is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments."
