    "intro": "Canna ascendens, commonly known as the tall canna, is a striking perennial plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stalks that can reach heights of up to 6 feet, supporting large, heart-shaped leaves that are often bright green. The plant produces showy, orange-red bracts that resemble flowers, although they are actually modified leaves. Canna ascendens thrives in moist, well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its botanical features make it both visually appealing and relatively easy to care for in the right environment."
