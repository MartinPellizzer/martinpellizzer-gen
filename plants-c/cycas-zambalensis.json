    "intro": "Cycas zambalensis, commonly known as the Zambal cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Cycas zambalensis is adapted to grow in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
