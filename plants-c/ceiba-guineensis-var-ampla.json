    "intro": "Ceiba guineensis var. ampla, commonly known as the African ceiba, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its towering height, often reaching up to 30 meters, and its buttressed roots that help stabilize it in loose soils. The tree produces large, showy white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing seeds covered in a fibrous aril. The wood of this species is valued for its light weight and resistance to termites, making it useful in construction and furniture-making."
