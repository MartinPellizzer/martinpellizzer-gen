    "intro": "Carex salina var. lanceata, commonly known as salt marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal and brackish wetlands. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is adapted to saline environments and is often found in tidal marshes and estuaries. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in these dynamic habitats. The plant plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
