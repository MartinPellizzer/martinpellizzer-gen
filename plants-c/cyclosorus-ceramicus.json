    "intro": "Cyclosorus ceramicus, commonly known as the ceramic liverwort, is a small, terrestrial moss-like plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has a simple morphology with leaf-like structures that are usually arranged in two rows along the stem. Cyclosorus ceramicus is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and can often be found in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, called capsules, are borne on stalks and release spores for dispersal."
