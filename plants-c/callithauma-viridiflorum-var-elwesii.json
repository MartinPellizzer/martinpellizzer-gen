    "intro": "Callithauma viridiflorum var. elwesii, commonly known as the Elwes' green-flowered cress, is a lesser-known variant of the green-flowered cress species. It is a low-growing annual plant with slender, branching stems and small, alternate leaves. The flowers are typically greenish-yellow, with four petals, and appear in clusters along the stems. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in wet meadows or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate botanical specimen."
