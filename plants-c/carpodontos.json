    "intro": "Carpodontos, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom during the summer months. It thrives in specific wetland habitats, often growing on the trunks of trees or in swampy areas. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
