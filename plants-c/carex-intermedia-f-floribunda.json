    "intro": "Carex intermedia f. floribunda, commonly known as the flowering bulrush, is a variant of the bulrush species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and produces showy, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils, making it a common sight in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies that help stabilize soil. This ornamental and ecological plant is valued for its ability to filter water and provide habitat for aquatic life."
