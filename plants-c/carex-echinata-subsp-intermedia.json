    "intro": "Carex echinata subsp. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate spike sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
