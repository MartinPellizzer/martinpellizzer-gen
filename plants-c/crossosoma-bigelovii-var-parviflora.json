    "intro": "Crossosoma bigelovii var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered crossosoma, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
