    "intro": "Cynometra brassii, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and compound leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its fine grain and durability, making it useful in furniture making. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered vulnerable in some regions."
