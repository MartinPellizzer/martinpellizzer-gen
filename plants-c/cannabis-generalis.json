    "intro": "Cannabis generalis, commonly known as hemp, is a member of the Cannabaceae family and is native to Central Asia. It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and is characterized by its tall, fibrous stalks and broad, serrated leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically pollinated by wind. Its flowering period varies depending on the climate, but it generally blooms in late summer to early autumn. Cannabis generalis is valued for its industrial uses, including fiber production, and contains low levels of THC compared to its psychoactive cousin, Cannabis sativa."
