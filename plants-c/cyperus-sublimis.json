    "intro": "Cyperus sublimis, commonly known as the skygrass, is a striking ornamental grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on spikes at the top of the stems. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy areas or along water bodies. Cyperus sublimis is valued for its architectural form and ability to add vertical interest to landscapes."
