    "intro": "Cyclosorus microsorus, commonly known as the small fern, is a small, delicate fern species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and finely divided, lanceolate fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Cyclosorus microsorus is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticultural settings."
