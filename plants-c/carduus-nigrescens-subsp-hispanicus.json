    "intro": "Carduus nigrescens subsp. hispanicus, commonly known as the Spanish thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers. The plant produces a distinctive, spiky seed head that aids in wind dispersal. It is often found in grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a resilient species in arid environments."
