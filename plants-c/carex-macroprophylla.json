    "intro": "Carex macroprophylla, commonly known as the giant sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, making it a striking feature in wetland environments. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. Its leaves are broad, flat, and grass-like, often reaching lengths of up to 1 meter, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Carex macroprophylla thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams."
