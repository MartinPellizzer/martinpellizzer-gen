    "intro": "Cissus zombensis, commonly known as the zombie vine, is a climbing plant native to parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that develop into bright red berries. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found growing along forest floors or on rocky surfaces. Due to its unique appearance and association with folklore, it has gained attention in both botanical and cultural contexts."
