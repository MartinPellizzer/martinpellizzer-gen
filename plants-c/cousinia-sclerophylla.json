    "intro": "Cousinia sclerophylla, commonly known as the hard-leaved cinquefoil, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody, sclerophyllous leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a splash of color to its harsh habitat. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Cousinia sclerophylla is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to survive in regions with low precipitation and high temperatures."
