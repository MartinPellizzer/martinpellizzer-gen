    "intro": "Cotoneaster pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf cotoneaster, is a small evergreen shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, compact growth with small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, five-petaled flowers in spring, followed by bright red berries in autumn. Its foliage remains green throughout the year, making it an attractive choice for ornamental gardening. Cotoneaster pusilla is well-suited for rock gardens or as a hedging plant due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
