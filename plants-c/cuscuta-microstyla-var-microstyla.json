    "intro": "Cuscuta microstyla var. microstyla, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants. The plant is native to North America and is often found on grasses and other low-growing vegetation. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it can quickly colonize new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
