    "intro": "Cyperus mucronatus, commonly known as the spike rush, is a flowering plant in the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, pond edges, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Cyperus mucronatus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
