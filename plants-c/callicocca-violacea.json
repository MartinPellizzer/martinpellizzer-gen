    "intro": "Callicocca violacea, commonly known as the purple bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Callicocca violacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
