    "intro": "Cynosurus echinatus subsp. hystrix, commonly known as the hairy rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, heaths, and rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and spikelets that are often reddish-brown in color. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
