    "intro": "Cerasus laurocerasus var. longifolia, commonly known as the cherry laurel or Prunus laurocerasus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and emit a sweet fragrance when crushed. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by dark purple berries in the fall. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its dense foliage and seasonal interest. However, it is toxic to humans and animals due to the presence of cyanogenic glycosides in its leaves and fruits."
