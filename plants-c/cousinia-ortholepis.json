    "intro": "Cousinia ortholepis, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, often hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Cousinia ortholepis produces small yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
