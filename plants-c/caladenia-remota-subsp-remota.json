    "intro": "Caladenia remota subsp. remota, commonly known as the remote spider-orchid, is an orchid species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spider-like flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with reddish-brown markings. The plant produces a single, narrow leaf and blooms during late summer to autumn. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open forests or heathlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
