    "intro": "Croton solanaceus, commonly known as the velvetleaf or pigweed, is a tropical plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family, not the Solanaceae family as the name suggests. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers, followed by greenish, spiny capsules that contain numerous seeds. It is native to regions of Africa and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many agricultural areas."
