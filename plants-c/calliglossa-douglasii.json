    "intro": "Calliglossa douglasii, commonly known as the Douglas's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows on decaying wood, relying on specific fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often blending with the surrounding environment. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered and is protected in many areas."
