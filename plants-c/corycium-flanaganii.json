    "intro": "Corycium flanaganii, commonly known as the Flanagan's corycium, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in areas with high altitude and cool temperatures. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, silky hair. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
