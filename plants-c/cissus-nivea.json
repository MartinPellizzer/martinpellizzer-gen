    "intro": "Cissus nivea, commonly known as the silver cissus, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-gray pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its stems are succulent and can develop adventitious roots, allowing it to climb and attach to surfaces. Cissus nivea is often used in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
