    "intro": "Corybas autumnalis, commonly known as the autumn torch orchid, is a species of terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, spurred labellum and its striking, flame-colored flowers that bloom in late autumn. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, including flies and beetles, which are attracted to its strong scent. Corybas autumnalis is a rare and endangered species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
