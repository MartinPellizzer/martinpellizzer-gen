It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by follicles containing seeds with silky hairs. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the eastern United States. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
