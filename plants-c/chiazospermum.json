    "intro": "Chiazospermum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated, woody pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. Chiazospermum is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
