    "intro": "Colymbada murbeckii, commonly known as the Murbeck's colymbadine, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help it adapt to its often harsh and humid habitats. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in cloud forests or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
