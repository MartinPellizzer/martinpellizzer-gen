    "intro": "Cattleya guttata var. leopardina, commonly known as the leopard orchid, is a hybrid orchid prized for its striking appearance. It features large, showy flowers with a dark purple or black background and bright yellow or orange markings that resemble a leopard's spots. The plant is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in warm, humid environments. It typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture from the air. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to help retain water."
