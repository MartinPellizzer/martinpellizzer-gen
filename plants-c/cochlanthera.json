    "intro": "Cochlanthera, commonly known as the fairy bells, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that often display striking colors such as pink, red, or white. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Cochlanthera species are often found in woodland and heathland environments, thriving in well-drained soils. They play an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators like bees and birds."
