    "intro": "Coleus omissus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved coleus, is a species of flowering plant in the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or violet in color, arranged in whorls along the stems. It is often cultivated for its ornamental foliage rather than its flowers. Coleus omissus prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds."
