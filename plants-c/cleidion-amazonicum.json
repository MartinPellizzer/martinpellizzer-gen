    "intro": "Cleidion amazonicum, commonly known as the Amazonian ironwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The tree has simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Due to its ecological importance and slow growth rate, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
