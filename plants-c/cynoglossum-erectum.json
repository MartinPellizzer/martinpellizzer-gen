    "intro": "Cynoglossum erectum, commonly known as blueweed, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Boraginaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while the plant often grows in moist soils in meadows and along stream banks. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. Cynoglossum erectum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
