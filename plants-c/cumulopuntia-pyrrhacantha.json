    "intro": "Cumulopuntia pyrrhacantha, commonly known as the red-spined cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically green with red spines, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in inflorescences at the stem tips. Its adaptations to harsh environments include thick, water-storing stems and a reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. Cumulopuntia pyrrhacantha is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to full sun exposure."
