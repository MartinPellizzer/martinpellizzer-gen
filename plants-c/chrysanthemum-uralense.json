It features a robust root system and upright, branching stems covered in soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces numerous daisy-like flowers with yellow to orange centers and white to pink petals, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its hardy nature allows it to withstand cold climates, contributing to its presence in temperate and subarctic regions."
