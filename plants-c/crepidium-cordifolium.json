    "intro": "Crepidium cordifolium, commonly known as the heart-leaved twayblade, is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is a small, perennial herb that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and woodlands. The plant has a slender, leafless stem that supports its delicate, heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish and are arranged in a spike, typical of many orchids. Crepidium cordifolium is known for its ability to form dense colonies and is often found in association with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption."
