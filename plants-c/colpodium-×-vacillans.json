    "intro": "Colpodium \u00d7 vacillans, commonly known as the hybrid water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and ditches. The plant features finely divided, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered in a spikelike inflorescence, with both male and female flowers present on the same plant. Colpodium \u00d7 vacillans plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
