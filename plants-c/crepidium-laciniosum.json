    "intro": "Crepidium laciniosum, commonly known as the lace-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and intricate, showy inflorescences that consist of numerous small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts."
