    "intro": "Catha integrifolia, commonly known as khat, is a flowering plant native to the horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its upright shrub-like growth, with dark green, serrated leaves and small white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant contains psychoactive alkaloids, primarily cathinone and cathine, which contribute to its stimulating effects. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its medicinal and recreational uses, it has been the subject of both cultural significance and legal regulation in various regions."
