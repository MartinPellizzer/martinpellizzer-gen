    "intro": "Cephalomanes atrovirens, commonly known as the black-headed sea hare, is a species of sea hare found in tropical and subtropical marine environments. It belongs to the family Aplysiidae and is characterized by its elongated, soft body and distinctive dark head. The plant, though not a true plant, is a marine gastropod mollusk with a unique ability to produce and store toxins in its skin. Its body is covered in a layer of mucus, which serves as a defense mechanism against predators. The species plays an important role in its ecosystem by contributing to the nutrient cycle through its feeding and excretion activities."
