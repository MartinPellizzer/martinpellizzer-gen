    "intro": "Cryptangium uliginosum, commonly known as the swamp cryptangium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It typically grows in marshy areas and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of wetland health."
