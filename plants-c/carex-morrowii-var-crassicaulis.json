    "intro": "Carex morrowii var. crassicaulis, commonly known as the broad-leaved sedge, is a perennial plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its robust, grass-like foliage that forms dense clumps, with broad, flat leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces spikes of small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by cylindrical seed heads. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
