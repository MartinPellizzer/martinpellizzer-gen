    "intro": "Coccinia rehmannii, commonly known as the small-leaf cucumber or African cucumber, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other cucurbits like cucumbers and melons. The plant produces small, yellow, bell-shaped flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its fruit is a small, green, edible berry that turns orange when ripe. The leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
