    "intro": "Cnidoscolus repandus, commonly known as the stinging leaf or velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stinging hairs, which can cause irritation upon contact. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, fleshy fruits that are often consumed by both humans and animals. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in disturbed soils or near water sources. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
