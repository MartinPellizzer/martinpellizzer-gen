    "intro": "Calligonum junceum subsp. lidmilae, commonly known as the desert rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that often grow close to the ground, forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in spike-like inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. This subspecies is well-suited for xerophytic conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
