It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has slender, often hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help it thrive in its alpine or subalpine habitats.

This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
