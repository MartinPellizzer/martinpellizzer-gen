    "intro": "Cotoneaster subalpinus, commonly known as the alpine cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cooler climates. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that turn red in the autumn, adding to its ornamental value. Its flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in clusters, and it produces bright red berries that are a food source for birds. Cotoneaster subalpinus is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
