    "intro": "Calyptranthes tonii, commonly known as the Hawaiian calyptranthes, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant typically features opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface and can produce small, white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland forest habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
