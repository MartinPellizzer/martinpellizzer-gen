    "intro": "Cryptantha maritima var. cedrosensis, commonly known as the Cedros Island cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Baja California, Mexico. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, adapting to the harsh maritime environment. It has slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss. This variety is notable for its limited distribution and is considered a rare and endemic species."
