    "intro": "Callicarpa mollis var. ramosissima, commonly known as the fragrant beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, violet-blue berries that are highly ornamental and attract birds. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and a slightly aromatic scent when crushed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Its flowering period occurs in late spring, producing pale yellow flowers that give way to the striking berries in autumn."
