    "intro": "Cleistanthus robustus, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and large, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody capsules containing seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. However, due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
