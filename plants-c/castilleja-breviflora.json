    "intro": "Castilleja breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces small, bright orange or yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in pairs along the stem. Castilleja breviflora is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe."
