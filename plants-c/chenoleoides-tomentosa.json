It is characterized by its dense, soft, and hairy foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in green or reddish hues, and bloom during the warmer months. Chenoleoides tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential ecological roles in its native habitats."
