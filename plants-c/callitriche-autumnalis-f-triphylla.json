    "intro": "Callitriche autumnalis f. triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaf water starwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It is a submerged aquatic plant characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that are typically borne on short pedicels near the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
