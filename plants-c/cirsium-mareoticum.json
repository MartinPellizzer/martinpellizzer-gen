    "intro": "Cirsium mareoticum, commonly known as the Delta thistle, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of the Nile Delta in Egypt. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, saline soils and is often found in marshy areas along the shoreline. Its robust root system helps stabilize the soil, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems. Cirsium mareoticum is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine."
