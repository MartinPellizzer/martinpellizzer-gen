    "intro": "Cousinia horridula, commonly known as the horned fritillary, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to dry, harsh environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cousinia horridula is often found in mountainous areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
