    "intro": "Cuscuta arvensis var. calycina, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves germinating on the surface of host plants. The plant's stems are thread-like and can\u7f20\u7ed5 around hosts, forming a network of connections. It is often found in agricultural fields and disturbed soils, where it can become a problematic weed. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a challenging plant to control."
