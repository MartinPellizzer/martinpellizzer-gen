    "intro": "Cephalocereus atroviridis, commonly known as the Black Thorn Cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with dark green, ribbed stems that can grow up to 10 feet tall. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its spines are typically black or dark brown, giving it its common name. The cactus is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
