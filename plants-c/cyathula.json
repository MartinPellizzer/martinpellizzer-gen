    "intro": "Cyathula, commonly known as the bladder nut or Chinese bladder nut, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique cyathium inflorescence, which consists of a cup-like structure that houses the male and female flowers. Cyathula species are typically shrubs or small trees, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. They produce small, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed, and their leaves are usually alternate and simple. The genus includes several species, such as Cyathula officinalis, which has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
