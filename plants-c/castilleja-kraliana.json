    "intro": "Castilleja kraliana, commonly known as Kral's paintbrush, is a species of flowering plant in the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant is characterized by its showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Castilleja kraliana is native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon."
