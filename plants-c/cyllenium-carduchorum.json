    "intro": "Cyllenium carduchorum, commonly known as the Carduchorum cyllenium, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool temperatures. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyllenium carduchorum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
