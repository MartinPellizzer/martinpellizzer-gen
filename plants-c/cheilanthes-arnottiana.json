    "intro": "Cheilanthes arnottiana, commonly known as the Arnold's rockcap, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and features small, dark green, leathery fronds. Native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico, it thrives in rocky, arid environments. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in crevices and store water. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
