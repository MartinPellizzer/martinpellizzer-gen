    "intro": "Cyperus dactyliformis var. gueinzii, commonly known as the Gueinz's flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often forming dense stands in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, three-ranked flowers, which are usually wind-pollinated. This variety is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical form of Cyperus dactyliformis."
