    "intro": "Cremanium trinerve, commonly known as the three-veined cremanium, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, pinnate fronds with three prominent veins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or forested slopes. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by spore-bearing structures known as sori. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cremanium trinerve is considered a species of conservation concern."
