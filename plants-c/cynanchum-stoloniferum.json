    "intro": "Cynanchum stoloniferum, commonly known as the creeping milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It features a sprawling growth habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread extensively across the ground. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Cynanchum stoloniferum is adapted to survive in harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and efficient water use."
