It is a columnar cactus characterized by its ribbed stem and sparse, spiny foliage. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for collectors and desert gardeners."
