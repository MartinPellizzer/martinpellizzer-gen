    "intro": "Cyphostemma knittelii, commonly known as the Knittel's moonvane, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by follicles that contain seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky habitats and along riverbanks. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
