It belongs to the family Betulaceae and is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by edible nuts that mature in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and serrated, turning yellow in autumn. This variety is often used in hedges and for ornamental purposes due to its attractive form and hardy nature."
