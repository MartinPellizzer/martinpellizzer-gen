    "intro": "Corydalis longipes var. burkillii, commonly known as Burkill's longipes corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in spring. It prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in botanical collections."
