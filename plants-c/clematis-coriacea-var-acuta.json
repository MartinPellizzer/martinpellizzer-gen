    "intro": "Clematis coriacea var. acuta, commonly known as the sharpleaf clematis, is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with sharply pointed leaflets, typically arranged in an odd-pinnate fashion. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its vigorous climbing habit makes it a popular choice for trellises and garden structures."
