    "intro": "Cuscuta arvensis var. verrucosa, commonly known as the yellow dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas. While it can be a nuisance in agricultural settings, it is also studied for its unique parasitic adaptations and ecological interactions."
