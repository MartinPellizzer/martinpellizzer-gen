    "intro": "Crataegus consanguinea, commonly known as the close relative hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to ovate leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are edible but often bitter. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential cardiovascular benefits. Crataegus consanguinea thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens and natural landscapes."
