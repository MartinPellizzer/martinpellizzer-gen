    "intro": "Cheilanthes longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its short, dense fronds with a leathery texture. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates and is well adapted to drought conditions due to its succulent leaves. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Cheilanthes longipes is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in harsh environments."
