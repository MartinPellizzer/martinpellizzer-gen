    "intro": "Centipeda minima subsp. minima, commonly known as the small centipeda, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tiny, white or pale green flowers in clusters. It is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes. Due to its delicate appearance, it is often used in ornamental gardening for its fine texture and subtle color."
