    "intro": "Cistus \u00d7 corbariensis var. ovatus, commonly known as the broad-leaved rockrose, is a hybrid shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for Mediterranean climates. Its leaves are leathery and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers have a distinctive, honey-scented aroma. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
