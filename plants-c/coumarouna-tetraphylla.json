    "intro": "Coumarouna tetraphylla, commonly known as the four-leafed fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often used in ornamental gardening. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help prevent soil erosion. The leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a soft, leathery texture that distinguishes it from other fern species."
