    "intro": "Cinchona lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf quinine tree, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant is notable for its medicinal properties, as it contains alkaloids such as quinine, which has been historically used to treat malaria. Its bark is the primary source of these compounds, making it an important plant in both traditional and modern pharmacology. Cinchona lancifolia thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations."
