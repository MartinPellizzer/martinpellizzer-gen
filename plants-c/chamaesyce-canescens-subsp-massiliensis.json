It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal or inland dunes. The plant features small, narrow leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-yellow, and clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well-adapted to harsh, arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
