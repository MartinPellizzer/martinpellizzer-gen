    "intro": "Cattleya araguaiensis, commonly known as the Amazonian Lady's Slipper, is a tropical orchid native to Brazil. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive pouch-like lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the dense rainforests. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Blooming in spring, it produces fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple."
