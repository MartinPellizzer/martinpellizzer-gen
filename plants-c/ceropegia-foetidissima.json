    "intro": "Ceropegia foetidissima, commonly known as the stinkplant, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent perennial that produces small, fragrant flowers that are highly attractive to specific pollinators. The plant has fleshy, often hairy leaves and stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor, which is believed to mimic the scent of decaying meat to attract carrion flies. This unique adaptation aids in its reproductive success in its native habitat."
