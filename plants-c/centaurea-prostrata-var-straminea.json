    "intro": "Centaurea prostrata var. straminea, commonly known as the prostrate cornflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features slender, creeping stems that often lie close to the ground, forming a dense mat. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with red or orange centers, typical of the Centaurea genus. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and wildflower borders."
