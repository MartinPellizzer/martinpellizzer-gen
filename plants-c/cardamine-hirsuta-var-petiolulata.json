    "intro": "Cardamine hirsuta var. petiolulata, commonly known as the hairy watercress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. Its small white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early spring. This variety is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
