    "intro": "Cerastium ramondii, commonly known as Ramond's chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
