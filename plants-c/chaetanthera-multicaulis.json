It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant features multiple stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. It produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are characteristic of the Apiaceae family. The plant's botanical structure supports its role in local ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small fauna."
