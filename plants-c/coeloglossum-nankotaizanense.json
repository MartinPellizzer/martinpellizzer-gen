    "intro": "Coeloglossum nankotaizanense, commonly known as the Nankotaizan ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and small, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in cool, humid environments with high air circulation. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is critically endangered and protected in its native range."
