    "intro": "Crepis fuliginosa, commonly known as the sooty cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are usually basal, with a rough texture and a bluish-green hue, while its flowers are small and yellow, often appearing in clusters. Crepis fuliginosa is known for its resilience and is often found in high-altitude environments where few plants can survive."
