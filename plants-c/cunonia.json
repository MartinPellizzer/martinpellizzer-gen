    "intro": "Cunonia, commonly known as the African wild peach, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhamnaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in southern Africa, with some extending into Australia and Madagascar. These plants are shrubs or small trees, often characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The fruit is typically a drupe, containing a single seed, and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Cunonia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in their native habitats."
