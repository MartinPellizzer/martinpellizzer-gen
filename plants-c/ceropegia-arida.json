    "intro": "Ceropegia arida, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a distinctive hooded shape. Its leaves are usually reduced to small scales, further minimizing water loss. Ceropegia arida is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal rainfall."
