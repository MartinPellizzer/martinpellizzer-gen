    "intro": "Centaurium uliginosum, commonly known as swamp centaury, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, erect stems that are often reddish in color and bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stems. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Centaurium uliginosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
