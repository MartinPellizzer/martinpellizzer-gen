It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. The plant has slender, often thorned stems and pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or coastal environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
