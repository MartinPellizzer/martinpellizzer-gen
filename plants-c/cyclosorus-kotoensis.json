    "intro": "Cyclosorus kotoensis, commonly known as the Koto's water clover, is a rare aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, floating leaves that resemble a clover leaf, typically with four lobes. The plant thrives in shallow, still freshwater habitats, such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are borne on short stalks and are often submerged. Cyclosorus kotoensis plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering nutrients and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
