    "intro": "Camassia leichtlinii var. watsonii, commonly known as Watson's camas, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its blue to violet bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Its leaves are grass-like and form a basal rosette, while its stems are erect and bear the showy flowers. Watson's camas is an important nectar source for pollinators and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
