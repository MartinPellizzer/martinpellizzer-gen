    "intro": "Chaerophyllum orientalis, commonly known as the Eastern hogweed, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, pinnately lobed leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, white or greenish-yellow flowers arranged in an umbel, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a potentially harmful plant to handle without proper protection."
