    "intro": "Cyclostemon usambaricus, commonly known as the Usambara cycad, is a unique plant native to the Usambara Mountains in Tanzania. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
