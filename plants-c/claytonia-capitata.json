    "intro": "Claytonia capitata, commonly known as the spring beauty, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, oval leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few days, but they are highly attractive to pollinators. Claytonia capitata is an herbaceous perennial that goes dormant during the summer months."
