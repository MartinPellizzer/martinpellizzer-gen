    "intro": "Convolvulus argyrothamnos, commonly known as silverleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silvery-white hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, typically blooming in the morning. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
