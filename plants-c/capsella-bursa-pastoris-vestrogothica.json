It features small, white flowers with five petals and stamens that are typically arranged in a whorl. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often covered in fine hairs. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that dehisces to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is native to Europe and has been naturalized in many parts of the world."
