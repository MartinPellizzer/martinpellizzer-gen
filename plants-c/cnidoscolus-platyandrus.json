    "intro": "Cnidoscolus platyandrus, commonly known as the broad-leaved stinging leaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stinging hairs, which can cause irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, spiny fruits containing bright red, fleshy seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
