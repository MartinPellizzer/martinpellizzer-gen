It features compact, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, arranged in a rosette formation. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring or summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
