It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble petals. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy and aromatic. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale purple or white, which bloom in the summer months. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
