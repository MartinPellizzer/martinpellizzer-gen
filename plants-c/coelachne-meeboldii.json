    "intro": "Coelachne meeboldii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. Coelachne meeboldii plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and distribution."
