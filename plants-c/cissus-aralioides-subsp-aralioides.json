    "intro": "Cissus aralioides subsp. aralioides, commonly known as the climbing devil's ivy, is a tropical vine native to southern Africa. It features heart-shaped, glossy dark green leaves with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. It thrives in humid, well-drained soil and requires moderate light to flourish. Its vigorous climbing habit makes it a popular choice for vertical gardening and indoor decoration."
