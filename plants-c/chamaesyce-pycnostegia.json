It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it well adapted to wet environments and contribute to its role in ecological systems."
