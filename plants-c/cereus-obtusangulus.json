    "intro": "Cereus obtusangulus, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright-colored flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it produces small, rounded fruits. Despite its name, the moon cactus is not a true cactus but a hybrid between a genus of cacti and a related plant."
