    "intro": "Chamaecrista ensiformis var. ensiformis, commonly known as the narrowleaf burr legume, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are divided into small, thread-like leaflets, and its distinctive yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Its botanical features make it an important plant for ecological studies and potential medicinal applications."
