    "intro": "Centaurea wendelboi, commonly known as Wendelbo's knapweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking purple-blue flowers and spiny bracts. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, seed-like fruits called cypsela. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
