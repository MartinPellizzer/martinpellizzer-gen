    "intro": "Caustis pentandra, commonly known as the African water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its broad, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in spikes, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies along riverbanks and wetlands. Caustis pentandra is also valued for its medicinal properties, with various parts of the plant used in traditional medicine."
