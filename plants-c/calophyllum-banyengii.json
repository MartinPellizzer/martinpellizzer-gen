    "intro": "Calophyllum banyengii, commonly known as the Banyeng tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Calophyllaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in small inflorescences, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. Its roots and bark have been traditionally used in local medicine for their purported antifungal and anti-inflammatory properties. The plant is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
