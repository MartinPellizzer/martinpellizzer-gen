    "intro": "Calamagrostis odessana, commonly known as the Odessa reed, is a perennial grass native to the steppes of southern Russia and Ukraine. It features tall, slender stalks that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often silver-white underneath. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate floral display. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for ornamental use in gardens. Its adaptability and drought tolerance make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
