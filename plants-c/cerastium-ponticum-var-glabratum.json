    "intro": "Cerastium ponticum var. glabratum, commonly known as the smooth rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate habit and small, clustered flowers. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a smooth texture, and the plant produces white or pinkish flowers in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in limestone or gravelly habitats. This variety is distinguished by its glabrous (hairless) stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance among other Cerastium species."
