    "intro": "Canadanthus, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to North America and features showy, daisy-like flowers with purple or pink petals and a central cone-shaped cluster of tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in prairies, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil. Canadanthus species are valued for their ornamental beauty and their role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. They are also popular in native plant gardens due to their hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
