    "intro": "Cyathea phalaenolepis, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are robust and help anchor it to the forest floor, while its fronds are used for photosynthesis. Cyathea phalaenolepis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various organisms."
