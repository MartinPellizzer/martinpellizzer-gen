    "intro": "Carex supina var. spaniocarpa, commonly known as the spreading basket sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown to reddish-brown flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological benefits."
