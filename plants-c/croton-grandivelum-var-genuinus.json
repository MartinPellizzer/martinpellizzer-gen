    "intro": "Croton grandivelum var. genuinus, commonly known as the golden croton, is a tropical shrub characterized by its vibrant, multicolored leaves. The foliage displays a striking combination of yellow, orange, and red hues, which are due to the presence of various pigments such as carotenoids and anthocyanins. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens with suitable conditions."
