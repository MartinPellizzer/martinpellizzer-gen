    "intro": "Caladenia bigeminata, commonly known as the twin-lobed spider orchid, is an endemic species of Western Australia. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, wiry stem that bears a single, strikingly colored flower. The orchid's flower has a distinctive, elongated labellum that is often adorned with intricate patterns. It thrives in sandy soils and is typically found in open habitats such as heathlands and woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable plant species."
