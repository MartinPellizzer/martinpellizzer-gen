    "intro": "Cypripedium insigne var. moensii, commonly known as the White Lady's Slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a pollination mechanism. The plant typically grows in cool, moist habitats such as forests and rocky slopes, where it thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are broad and leathery, and it produces a single flower per stem, making it a prized species among orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
