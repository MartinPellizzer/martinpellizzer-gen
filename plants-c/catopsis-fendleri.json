    "intro": "Catopsis fendleri, commonly known as the Mexican air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico and Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, helping it survive in arid conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Catopsis fendleri is popular as a low-maintenance houseplant due to its ability to thrive in indirect light and minimal water."
