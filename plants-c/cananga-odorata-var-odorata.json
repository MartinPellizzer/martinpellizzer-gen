    "intro": "Cananga odorata var. odorata, commonly known as the Chinese sandalwood or simply sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic wood, which contains high concentrations of sesquiterpene compounds, particularly alpha-santalol and beta-santalol. The tree produces fragrant yellow flowers that are often used in religious and ceremonial contexts. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a glossy green appearance. The plant is valued not only for its wood but also for its essential oils, which are used in perfumery and traditional medicine."
