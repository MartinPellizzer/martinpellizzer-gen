    "intro": "Cyanthillium patulum, commonly known as the broadleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features basal leaves that are broad and lobed, with a hairy surface. Its yellow flowers bloom in clusters and are followed by fluffy seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. Cyanthillium patulum is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates."
