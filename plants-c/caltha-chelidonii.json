    "intro": "Caltha chelidonii, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features bright yellow, buttercup-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has smooth, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Caltha chelidonii is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed."
