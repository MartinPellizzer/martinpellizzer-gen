    "intro": "Conyza anagallidifolia, commonly known as common groundsel, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Africa but widely naturalized in many parts of the world. It typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant has opposite, hairy, serrated leaves and produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in clusters. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions. It is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various environmental conditions."
