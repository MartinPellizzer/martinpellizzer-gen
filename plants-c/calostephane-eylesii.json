    "intro": "Calostephane eylesii, commonly known as the Eyles' calostephane, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant grows in rocky or alpine habitats, often in areas with poor soil and harsh environmental conditions. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
