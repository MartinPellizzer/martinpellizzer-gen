    "intro": "Chrysophyllum myrtifolium, commonly known as the African cherry or myrtle-leaved chrysophyllum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It has glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite and often have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that give way to edible, red-orange berries. These berries are rich in vitamin C and are used both for food and traditional medicine. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in its native habitat."
