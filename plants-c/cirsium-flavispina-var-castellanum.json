It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and large, purple to pinkish flower heads. The plant features deeply lobed, gray-green leaves with sharp margins, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The Castellano thistle is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
