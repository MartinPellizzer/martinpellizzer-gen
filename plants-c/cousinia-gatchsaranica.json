    "intro": "Cousinia gatchsaranica, commonly known as the Gatchsaran cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, arid environments. The plant features small, narrow leaves and produces yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often found in alpine and subalpine zones. Cousinia gatchsaranica is valued for its resilience and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in rock gardens."
