    "intro": "Campanula aspera, commonly known as the rough bellflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves, which give it its scientific name \"aspera,\" meaning rough in Latin. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and borders. Campanula aspera is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
