    "intro": "Cristaria glabra, commonly known as the smooth water lily, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It features broad, floating leaves that are typically smooth and waxy, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots anchor it in shallow water, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form colonies. Cristaria glabra plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various water organisms."
