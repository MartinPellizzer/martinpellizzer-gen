    "intro": "Cyperus resinosus, commonly known as the resinous flatsedge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and ponds, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. Its slender, triangular stems are often covered in a waxy, resinous coating, giving it its common name. Cyperus resinosus produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated."
