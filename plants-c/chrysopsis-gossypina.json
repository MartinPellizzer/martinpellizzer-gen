    "intro": "Chrysopsis gossypina, commonly known as the cottonweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its yellow flowers are surrounded by pale green bracts, and it produces fluffy, seed-filled capsules that aid in wind dispersal. Chrysopsis gossypina is often considered a weed but has ecological value as a food source for pollinators."
