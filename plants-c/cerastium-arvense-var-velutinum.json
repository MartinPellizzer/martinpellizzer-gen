    "intro": "Cerastium arvense var. velutinum, commonly known as velvet mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, hairy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers in early spring, which are arranged in umbels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective ground cover in garden settings."
