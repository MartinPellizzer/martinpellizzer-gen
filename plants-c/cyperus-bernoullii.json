    "intro": "Cyperus bernoullii, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family Cyperaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often forming dense stands in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. Its slender, grass-like leaves are usually arranged in three rows, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Cyperus bernoullii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
