    "intro": "Chrysanthemum haussknechtii, commonly known as the Hausknecht's chrysanthemum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with finely divided, gray-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like yellow flowers in the autumn, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
