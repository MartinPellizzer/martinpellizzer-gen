    "intro": "Campelia zanonia var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth campelia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a contrasting red or purple throat. The plant has smooth, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure."
