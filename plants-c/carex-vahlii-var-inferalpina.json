    "intro": "Carex vahlii var. inferalpina, commonly known as the Alpine sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Alps and adjacent mountain areas. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and specialized adaptations to cold, moist environments. The plant typically forms dense clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important component of mountain ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and biodiversity."
