    "intro": "Carpinus laxiflora var. chartacea, commonly known as the silky maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern China. It is characterized by its finely hairy, chartaceous (paper-like) leaves that are often described as silky to the touch. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its fruits are small, winged samaras that disperse via wind. The species is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
