    "intro": "Cousinia hilariae, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. It has slender, hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Cousinia hilariae is adapted to harsh, arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
