    "intro": "Carduus pycnocephalus var. cinereus, commonly known as the gray thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, gray-green foliage and spiny, spherical flower heads that typically bloom in late summer. The plant produces small yellow flowers that develop into prickly, woody fruits. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wastelands, and along roadsides. Due to its robust growth and hardy nature, it is considered a common weed in many regions."
