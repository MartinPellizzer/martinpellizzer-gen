    "intro": "Crepidomanes dichotomum, commonly known as the forked liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leaf-like structures called phyllidia, which are typically arranged in a dichotomous branching pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, known as gemmae, are produced in clusters and aid in vegetative propagation. Crepidomanes dichotomum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for small invertebrates."
