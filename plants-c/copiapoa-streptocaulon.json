    "intro": "Copiapoa streptocaulon, commonly known as the zigzag cactus, is a species native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its ribbed stem and distinctive, wavy, zigzag-shaped ridges. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Copiapoa streptocaulon is well adapted to extreme desert environments, with a slow growth rate and a long lifespan."
