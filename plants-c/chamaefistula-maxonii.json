It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often grayish-green in color. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters, while its fruit is a small, woody capsule. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
