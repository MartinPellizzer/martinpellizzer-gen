    "intro": "Cistus ladanifer subsp. mauritianus, commonly known as the Mauritius rockrose, is a shrub native to the island of Mauritius. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces a resinous substance called ladanum, which has been historically used in perfumery and traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to a Mediterranean climate. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
