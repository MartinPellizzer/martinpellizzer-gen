    "intro": "Calanthe wuxiensis, commonly known as the Wuxi calanthe, is a rare orchid species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of white or pale pink flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
