    "intro": "Carduus nyassanus, commonly known as the Nyassan thistle, is a perennial herb native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are covered in dense, stiff hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers bloom in late summer and are followed by bristly, spiny seed heads that aid in wind dispersal."
