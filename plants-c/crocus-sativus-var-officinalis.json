It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with yellow stigmas. The plant's most valuable part is the stigmas, which are harvested and dried to produce saffron, a highly prized spice and dye. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. It is a perennial herb that blooms in the autumn, making it a unique addition to gardens and agricultural landscapes."
