    "intro": "Crotalaria tabularis, commonly known as the flatpod cowpea, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and bean-like pods. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with palmate leaves that have five to seven lobes. Its seeds are enclosed in flat, pod-like structures that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds through the wind. Crotalaria tabularis is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a valuable plant in agricultural settings."
