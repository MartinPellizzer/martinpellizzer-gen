    "intro": "Cordylanthus nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra onion, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-shaped flower clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and open habitats, such as meadows and slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slight garlic scent, while its white or greenish flowers bloom in late spring. Cordylanthus nevadensis is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
