    "intro": "Crocus vernus var. trilineatus, commonly known as the tricolor crocus, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive three-colored petals, typically featuring white, yellow, and purple markings. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. Its bulbs are adapted for survival in temperate climates, and it thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and its ability to naturalize over time."
