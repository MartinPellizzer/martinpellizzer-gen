    "intro": "Clematis montana f. lilacina, commonly known as the lilac-flowered Clematis, is a deciduous climbing plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its most striking characteristic is its showy, lilac-pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The flowers are actinomorphic, with five sepals and five petals, and are often accompanied by long, slender stamens. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens as a climbing plant due to its vigorous growth habit. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal flowering."
