    "intro": "Carex teretiuscula var. ramosa, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are typically found in the leaf axils. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in association with other wetland plants. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in aquatic habitats."
