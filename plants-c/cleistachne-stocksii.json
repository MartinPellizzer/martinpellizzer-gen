    "intro": "Cleistachne stocksii, commonly known as the Stocks' cleistachne, is a grass species native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, often invisible flowers that are enclosed within the spikelets, a feature typical of many grasses. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
