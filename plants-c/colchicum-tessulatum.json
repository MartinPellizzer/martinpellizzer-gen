    "intro": "Colchicum tessulatum, commonly known as the spotted autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Its bulbs are toxic and contain colchicine, a compound used in medical treatments. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade in woodland environments."
