    "intro": "Corybas walliae, commonly known as the purple ghost orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet forests of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, hood-like flower that resembles a ghostly face, giving it its common name. The plant produces a single, showy flower that is typically purple or violet in color, with intricate patterns on its labellum. It grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in association with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
