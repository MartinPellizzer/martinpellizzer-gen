It is characterized by its stout, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rounded base. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade."
