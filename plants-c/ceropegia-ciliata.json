It is characterized by its trailing stems and small, fleshy leaves covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces delicate, tubular flowers that are often pale green or white, with a unique structure that attracts specific pollinators. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens with suitable conditions."
