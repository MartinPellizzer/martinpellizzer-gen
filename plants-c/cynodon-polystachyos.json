    "intro": "Cynodon polystachyos, commonly known as the hairy bluestem, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which becomes more pronounced during the growing season. The plant produces dense, cylindrical inflorescences that are often tinged with purple or brown, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for dryland environments. Cynodon polystachyos is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
