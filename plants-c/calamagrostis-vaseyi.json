    "intro": "Calamagrostis vaseyi, commonly known as the vasey reedgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical leaves that are often blue-green in color, and it produces feathery, panicle-like inflorescences in the summer. Its botanical features make it an important species for wetland restoration and ecological stability. Calamagrostis vaseyi is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and landscapes."
