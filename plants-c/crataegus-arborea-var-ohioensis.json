    "intro": "Crataegus arborea var. ohioensis, commonly known as the Ohio hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 feet and features thorned branches, which are a characteristic botanical trait. The plant produces white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by red berries in the fall. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated margins, and it has a dense, rounded habit. The Ohio hawthorn is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodlands and along stream banks."
