    "intro": "Calamagrostis pungens, commonly known as the spiked sweetgrass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and feathery, silver-green foliage that adds ornamental value to gardens. The plant produces panicles of small, pale blue to purple flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and prairies. Calamagrostis pungens is valued for its ecological benefits and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
