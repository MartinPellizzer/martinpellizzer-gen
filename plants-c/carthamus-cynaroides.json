It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which resemble those of the sunflower, and its feathery, aromatic leaves. The plant produces striking, daisy-like blooms with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. Its botanical features include a taproot system and fibrous roots, which help it thrive in well-drained soils. The plant is widely cultivated for its seeds and the vibrant red-orange petals used in traditional medicine and dye production."
