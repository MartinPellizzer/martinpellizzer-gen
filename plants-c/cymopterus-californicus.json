    "intro": "Cymopterus californicus, commonly known as the California evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats like grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often hairy, while its stems are erect and branching. The fruit is a capsule that releases seeds when mature, contributing to its reproductive success in its native environment."
