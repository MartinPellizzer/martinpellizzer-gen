    "intro": "Cyperus haspanoides, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, three-bracted inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the stems. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female structures, a common trait in the sedge family. Cyperus haspanoides plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and can sometimes become invasive in non-native habitats."
