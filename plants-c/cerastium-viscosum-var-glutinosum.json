    "intro": "Cerastium viscosum var. glutinosum, commonly known as sticky weed or sticky chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that are covered in a dense layer of sticky, glandular hairs. The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and also bear the same sticky coating. Small white flowers with five petals appear in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. This plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in gardens."
