    "intro": "Chondrilla viminea, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and its ability to thrive in salty, sandy environments. The plant has a short, sturdy stem and produces small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. It is often found growing in dunes and along shorelines, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand. Chondrilla viminea is a hardy species that is well adapted to maritime conditions."
