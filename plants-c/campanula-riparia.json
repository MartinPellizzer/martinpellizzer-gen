    "intro": "Campanula riparia, commonly known as the river bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows along riverbanks and moist habitats, thriving in well-drained to slightly wet soils. The plant features upright stems that bear whorled leaves, which are often lance-shaped and slightly hairy. Its flowers are bell-shaped, typically blue or violet, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Campanula riparia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian zones."
