    "intro": "Cleistanthus helferi, commonly known as the Malayan starling tree, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal."
