    "intro": "Crataegus calpodendron var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces white to pinkish flowers in early spring, which are clustered in corymbs, followed by small, red berries in the fall. Its fruits are edible but have a tart flavor, and the plant is often used in ornamental gardening for its compact size and seasonal interest. The variety microcarpa is distinguished by its smaller fruits compared to other forms of Crataegus calpodendron."
