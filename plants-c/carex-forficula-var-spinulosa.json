    "intro": "Carex forficula var. spinulosa, commonly known as the spinylace sedge, is a perennial plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream edges. It has a fibrous root system and is often found in dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. Its variability in form and habitat makes it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
