    "intro": "Carlina acaulis subsp. aggregata, commonly known as the clustered cudweed, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form with dense clusters of hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in composite flower heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor habitats."
