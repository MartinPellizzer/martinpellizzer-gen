It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, followed by woody, spiny fruits that enclose the seeds.

The hairy conchocarpus is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
