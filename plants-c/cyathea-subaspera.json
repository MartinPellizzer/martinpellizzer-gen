    "intro": "Cyathea subaspera, commonly known as the rough tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately divided fronds. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-bearing cones, called sorangs, are located at the base of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Cyathea subaspera is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can grow up to several meters in height."
