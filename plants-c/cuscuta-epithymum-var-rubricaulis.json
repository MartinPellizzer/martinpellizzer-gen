    "intro": "Cuscuta epithymum var. rubricaulis, commonly known as red-stem dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to various regions in North America and is often found on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
