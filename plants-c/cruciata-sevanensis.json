    "intro": "Cruciata sevanensis, commonly known as the Lake Sevan crucian, is a rare flowering plant native to the Lake Sevan region in Armenia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its striking red bracts that surround its small yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats along the shores of the lake. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat degradation, it is considered vulnerable and requires protection to ensure its survival."
