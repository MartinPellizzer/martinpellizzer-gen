    "intro": "Cephalocereus fricii, commonly known as the Frici's night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Cephalocereus fricii is adapted to arid environments and requires well-drained soil and minimal water."
