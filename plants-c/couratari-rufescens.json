    "intro": "Couratari rufescens, commonly known as the red-barked sycamore, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Lecythidaceae and is characterized by its rough, reddish bark that peels in strips. The plant has large, simple leaves that are usually alternate and can reach up to 20 centimeters in length. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a distinctive fruit with a woody, spiky outer layer. Couratari rufescens is often found in moist, lowland forests and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
