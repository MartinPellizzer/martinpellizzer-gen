    "intro": "Cenchrus domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
