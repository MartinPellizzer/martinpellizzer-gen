    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia f. calvescens, commonly known as the round-leaf bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are rounded and hairy, with a distinctive bell-shaped blue or violet flower that blooms in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its flowers are tubular and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The variety f. calvescens is characterized by its more compact growth and smaller flowers compared to the typical form."
