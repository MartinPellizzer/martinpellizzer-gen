    "intro": "Cochlearia aphragmodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or alpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Cochlearia aphragmodes is a perennial species that plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
