    "intro": "Colchicum deserti-syriaci, commonly known as the Syrian autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It features a bulbous corm that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers with reflexed petals, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging after the flowers have faded. Colchicum deserti-syriaci is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some regions."
