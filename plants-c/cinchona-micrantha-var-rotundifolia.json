It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, often rounded leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that give way to red, fleshy berries. It is notable for containing alkaloids, including quinine, which has historical significance in medicine. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
