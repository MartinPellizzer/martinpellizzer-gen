    "intro": "Cousinia millefontana, commonly known as the mountain everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. Cousinia millefontana produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
