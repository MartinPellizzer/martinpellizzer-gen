    "intro": "Carpotroche caceresiae, commonly known as the Caceres's rock cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a feature that helps reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Carpotroche caceresiae is often found growing on rocky outcrops, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils."
