It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with three prominent teeth along the margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce dense clusters of fronds that can reach up to 30 inches in length. Candollea tridentata is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
