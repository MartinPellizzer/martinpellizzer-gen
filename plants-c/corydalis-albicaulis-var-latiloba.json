    "intro": "Corydalis albicaulis var. latiloba, commonly known as the broadleaf white-stemmed corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The leaves are typically broad and ovate, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its broader leaves and slightly different floral structure. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or rocky habitats."
