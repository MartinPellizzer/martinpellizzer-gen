    "intro": "Cuscuta microcephala, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle involving seed dispersal and germination on suitable hosts. The plant forms dense mats on its host, often reducing the host's growth and productivity. It is native to various regions in North America and is considered an invasive species in some areas. Its botanical study is important for understanding parasitic plant interactions and ecological impacts."
