    "intro": "Cardaria repens, commonly known as creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a dense mat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands or rocky areas."
