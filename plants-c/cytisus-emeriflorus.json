    "intro": "Cytisus emeriflorus, commonly known as the coastal broom, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and rocky coastlines. Its rapid growth and hardy nature make it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems."
