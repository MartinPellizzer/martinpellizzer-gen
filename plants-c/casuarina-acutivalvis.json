    "intro": "Casuarina acutivalvis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved she-oak, is a member of the Casuarinaceae family. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub native to eastern Australia. The plant is characterized by its unique, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals around the stems. Its small, yellowish flowers are followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain several seeds. Casuarina acutivalvis is often found in coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
