It is characterized by its showy, white or pink bract-like flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, red drupes in the fall. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Cornus costulata is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing food for birds and insects."
