It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer."
