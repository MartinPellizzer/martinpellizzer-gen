    "intro": "Chaetogastra rupestris, commonly known as the rock hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a small, shrub-like species that typically grows on rocky outcrops and gravelly soils. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine, hair-like structures, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Chaetogastra rupestris is adapted to thrive in low-water conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
