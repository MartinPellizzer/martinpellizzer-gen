    "intro": "Centaurea resupinata var. finitiva, commonly known as the creeping cornflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with purple or red centers, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, often hairy, and arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas."
