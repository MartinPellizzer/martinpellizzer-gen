It features small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its compact size and dense growth make it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens."
