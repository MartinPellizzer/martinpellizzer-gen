    "intro": "Ceterach officinarum nothosubsp. troodeum, commonly known as the coastal ceterach, is a hybrid plant species native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in saline and windy environments. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is adapted to the harsh conditions of coastal habitats, making it an important component of the local flora."
