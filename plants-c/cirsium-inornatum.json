    "intro": "Cirsium inornatum, commonly known as the pale coneflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and leafy foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has spiny, lobed leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers, which appear in late summer, are typically pale purple to white and are arranged in a conical shape. Cirsium inornatum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
