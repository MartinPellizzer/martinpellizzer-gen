    "intro": "Cola rondoensis, commonly known as the Rondo cola, is a species of the Cola genus native to tropical Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers followed by oval, woody pods containing stimulant-rich seeds. These seeds are used to make caffeine-containing beverages and have been historically valued for their psychoactive properties. Botanically, it is closely related to other cola species and is part of the Malvaceae family."
