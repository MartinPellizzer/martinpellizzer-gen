    "intro": "Croton perstipulatus, commonly known as the velvetleaf croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by bright orange or red berries that contain seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland forests and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in garden settings."
