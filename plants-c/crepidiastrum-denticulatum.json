    "intro": "Crepidiastrum denticulatum, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in summer, followed by dark blue to black berries. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a silvery underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is sometimes considered invasive in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal."
