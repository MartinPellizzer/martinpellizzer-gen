    "intro": "Clematis floribunda, commonly known as the sweet autumn clematis, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. The flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its vigorous climbing habit makes it a popular choice for trellises and arches in gardens."
