It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, which help it store water and withstand arid conditions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange, adding a vibrant touch to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
