    "intro": "Calamagrostis lapponica subsp. sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian moorgrass, is a perennial grass native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet, boggy habitats and is characterized by its tall, slender culms and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late summer. It is well adapted to cold climates and can tolerate waterlogged soils. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens and restoration projects."
