    "intro": "Coryphopteris seemannii, commonly known as the slender tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing spores on the underside of its fronds rather than flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
