    "intro": "Cyclosorus ponapeanus, commonly known as the Ponapean liverwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, acrocarpous moss-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or tree trunks. The plant has a thalloid structure with a leafy shoot system, and its leaves are usually arranged in a spiral pattern. It is characterized by its simple, undivided leaves and the presence of small, cup-like structures called gemmae, which aid in vegetative reproduction. Cyclosorus ponapeanus is native to the Pacific Islands, particularly the Caroline Islands, and is often found in humid tropical regions."
