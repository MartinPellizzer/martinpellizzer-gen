    "intro": "Cynodon tenuis, commonly known as slender buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and a dense, low-growing habit. The plant has narrow, wiry leaves that are often covered with fine hairs, and it produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for use in lawns and erosion control. Cynodon tenuis is also valued for its ability to form dense turf with minimal maintenance."
