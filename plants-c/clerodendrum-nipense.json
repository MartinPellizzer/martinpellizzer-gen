    "intro": "Clerodendrum nipense, commonly known as the red-rooted glorybower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its striking clusters of tubular, red or orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. Its roots are thick and fleshy, which help it store water in arid conditions. Clerodendrum nipense is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
