    "intro": "Ceanothus sphaerocarpus, commonly known as the globe-fruit ceanothus, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces distinctive, spherical, woody fruits that persist on the plant throughout the year. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Ceanothus sphaerocarpus is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
