    "intro": "Cornus racemosa f. caeruleocarpa, commonly known as the blue-fruited dogwood, is a variant of the common dogwood native to North America. It is characterized by its striking blue-black berries, which contrast with its white bracts that resemble flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are ovate with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green surface. This ornamental plant is valued for its seasonal interest, providing color in both summer and fall."
