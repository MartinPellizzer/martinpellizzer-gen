    "intro": "Cogswellia triternata, commonly known as the desert rose, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red, often with a white or yellow center. The plant has a succulent stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are typically small, fleshy, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Cogswellia triternata thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
