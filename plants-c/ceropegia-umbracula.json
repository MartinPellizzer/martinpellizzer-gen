    "intro": "Ceropegia umbracula, commonly known as the string of hearts, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale green, often with a distinctive hood-like structure. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Ceropegia umbracula is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
