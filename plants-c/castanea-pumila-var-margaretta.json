    "intro": "Castanea pumila var. margaretta, commonly known as the dwarf chestnut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, spiny capsules that contain one to three edible nuts, which are encased in a thick, hairy husk. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and historical significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
