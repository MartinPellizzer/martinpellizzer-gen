    "intro": "Cyperus pugioniformis, commonly known as the swordleaf flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. It produces small, clustered flowers that are often inconspicuous, and it is adapted to thrive in moist or aquatic environments. Cyperus pugioniformis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
