    "intro": "Chorizema trigonum, commonly known as the three-angled sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous annual plant that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant has small, trifoliate leaves that are arranged in a rosette, and its flowers are usually pink or purple, borne on slender stems. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water availability. Chorizema trigonum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland desert areas."
