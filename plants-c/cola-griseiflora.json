    "intro": "Cola griseiflora, commonly known as the gray-flowered cola, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to western Africa, where it grows in humid, tropical environments. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale green flowers. It produces hard, woody fruits that contain stimulant-rich seeds, similar to other cola species. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and research settings."
