    "intro": "Cyrtandra brevipedicellaris, commonly known as the short-stemmed Cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pink. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. It plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its native habitat, supporting various pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of Hawaiian flora. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
