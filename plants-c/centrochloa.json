    "intro": "Centrochloa, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. These plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. Centrochloa species are typically found in moist, disturbed soils in temperate regions. They have a fibrous root system and produce capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds. The genus includes several species, such as Centrochloa micrantha, which is often used in ecological restoration projects."
