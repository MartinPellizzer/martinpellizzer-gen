    "intro": "Carex heteroneura var. brevisquama, commonly known as the narrow-sheath sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 1 inch wide, and it produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers in the summer. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, short, narrow bracts. This sedge is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
