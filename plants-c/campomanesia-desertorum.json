    "intro": "Campomanesia desertorum, commonly known as the desert pomegranate, is a small evergreen shrub native to arid regions of northeastern Brazil. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, round, red berries that are edible and have a tangy, citrus-like flavor. It is well adapted to dry conditions, making it a valuable plant for xeriscaping and restoration projects in semi-arid environments."
