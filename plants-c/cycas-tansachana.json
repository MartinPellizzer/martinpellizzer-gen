    "intro": "Cycas tansachana, commonly known as the Thai cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant with a stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones on separate plants, a characteristic of gymnosperms. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental foliage. Cycas tansachana is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its resilience to environmental stress."
