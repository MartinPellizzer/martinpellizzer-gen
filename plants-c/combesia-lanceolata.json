    "intro": "Combesia lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf combesia, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lanceolate, with a smooth margin and a slightly hairy surface, while its small white flowers bloom in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Combesia lanceolata is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
