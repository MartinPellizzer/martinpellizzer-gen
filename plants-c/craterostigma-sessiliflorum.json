It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant has a compact growth habit, with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor deeply in rocky soils. Craterostigma sessiliflorum is well adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low moisture conditions."
