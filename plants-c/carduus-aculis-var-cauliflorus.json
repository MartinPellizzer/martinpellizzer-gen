    "intro": "Carduus aculis var. cauliflorus, commonly known as the clustered thistle, is a variant of the thistle genus characterized by its unique floral structure. This plant typically exhibits a compact, bushy growth habit with dense clusters of purple to pink flowers emerging from the base of the stems. Its leaves are usually spiny and lance-shaped, providing a defensive mechanism against herbivores. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
