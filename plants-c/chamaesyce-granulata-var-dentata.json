    "intro": "Chamaesyce granulata var. dentata, commonly known as the roughleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with hairy, lobed leaves that are often covered in small, raised bumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that appear in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Its unique morphology and adaptation to harsh conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
