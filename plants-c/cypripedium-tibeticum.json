    "intro": "Cypripedium tibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Tibet and adjacent areas in Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in cool, moist habitats at high altitudes, often in forested or rocky terrain. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
