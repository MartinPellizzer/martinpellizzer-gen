    "intro": "Cousinia jacobsii, commonly known as Jacob's cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Cousinia jacobsii is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient species in extreme climates."
