    "intro": "Clidemia micropetala, commonly known as the small-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Onagraceae family and typically grows on the branches of other trees, drawing water and nutrients from its host. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically white or pale green with four petals. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the health of its host tree."
