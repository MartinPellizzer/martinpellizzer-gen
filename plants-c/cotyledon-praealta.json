    "intro": "Cotyledon praealta, commonly known as the tall cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often adorned with striking purple or red markings. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on tall, branching stems. Cotyledon praealta thrives in well-draining soil and requires plenty of sunlight to maintain its coloration. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
