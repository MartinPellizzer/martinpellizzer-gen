    "intro": "Chrysanthemum tripinnatisectum, commonly known as the three-parted chrysanthemum, is a species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, tripinnatisect leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces showy yellow to orange flowers in the fall, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated for both its foliage and floral display."
