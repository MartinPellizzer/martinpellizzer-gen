It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, green berries that turn red when mature, which are edible but often used in local cuisines. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and have a slightly rough texture. The plant thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to poor soil conditions."
