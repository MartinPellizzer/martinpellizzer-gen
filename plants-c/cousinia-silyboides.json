    "intro": "Cousinia silyboides, commonly known as the desert goatherb, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited water availability. Its leaves are usually grayish-green and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Cousinia silyboides produces small yellow to brown flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
