    "intro": "Cotoneaster fastigiatus, commonly known as the upright cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features a compact, columnar growth habit with dense, dark green foliage that turns reddish-brown in autumn. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adaptable to a variety of soil types. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often used in landscaping for its structure and seasonal interest."
