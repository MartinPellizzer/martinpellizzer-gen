    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris f. apetala, commonly known as the leafy heather, is a variant of the common heather with a distinctive botanical feature: it lacks the typical floral bracts. This form is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are often more prominent than the flowers. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub that thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. The plant is native to western Europe and is often found in heathlands and moorlands. Its unique morphology makes it a valuable plant for ecological studies and horticultural use in specialized gardens."
