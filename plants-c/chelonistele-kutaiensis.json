It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped thallus structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in humid rainforests. Its botanical features include small, leaf-like structures arranged in a distinctive pattern. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research."
