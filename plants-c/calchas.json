    "intro": "Calchas, commonly known as the golden crown fern, is a striking evergreen plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds with a distinctive golden hue along the margins. The plant features a short, sturdy rhizome that supports its upright growth habit. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Calchas is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
