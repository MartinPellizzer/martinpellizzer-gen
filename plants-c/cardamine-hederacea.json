    "intro": "Cardamine hederacea, commonly known as ground ivy, is a small herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Cardamine hederacea is often considered a weed in agricultural and garden settings due to its rapid growth and persistence."
