    "intro": "Cheilanthes incana, commonly known as the woolly rockcap, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows on rocky outcrops and limestone formations. The plant is characterized by its pale, fuzzy foliage, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. Its rhizomes are thick and succulent, allowing it to survive periods of drought. Cheilanthes incana is often used in rock gardens and xeriscapes due to its hardy nature and ornamental appearance."
