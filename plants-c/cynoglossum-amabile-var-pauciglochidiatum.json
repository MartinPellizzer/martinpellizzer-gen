    "intro": "Cynoglossum amabile var. pauciglochidiatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are tubular and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is less densely hairy than the typical form, giving it a more refined appearance."
