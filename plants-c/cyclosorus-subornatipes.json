    "intro": "Cyclosorus subornatipes, commonly known as the horned bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called vesicles, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are thin and often clustered around the base of the plant, with the vesicles distributed along the stems. Cyclosorus subornatipes plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
