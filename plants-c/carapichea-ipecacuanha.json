It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces red berries that contain a milky latex, which has been historically used in traditional medicine. Its botanical significance lies in its unique chemical composition, including compounds with emetic properties. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a threatened species in its native range."
