    "intro": "Cynoctonum corymbosum, commonly known as the American persimmon, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by orange to red fruits that ripen in the fall. The fruits are fleshy, sweet when ripe, and contain a single large seed. It is valued for its ornamental value and as a source of food for wildlife and humans."
