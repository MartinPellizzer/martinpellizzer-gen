    "intro": "Cousinia grigoriewii, commonly known as the Armenian cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Cousinia grigoriewii is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions."
