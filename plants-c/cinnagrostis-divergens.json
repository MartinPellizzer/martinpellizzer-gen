    "intro": "Cinnagrostis divergens, commonly known as the divergent sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Cinnagrostis divergens is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
