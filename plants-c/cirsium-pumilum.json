    "intro": "Cirsium pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf thistle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers. The plant typically reaches a height of less than 10 inches, with dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Cirsium pumilum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
