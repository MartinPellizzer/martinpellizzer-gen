    "intro": "Cyrtandra \u00d7 malacophylla, commonly known as the hybrid beauty leaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Gesneriaceae family. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cyrtandra and another closely related species, typically Cyrtandra malacophylla. The plant is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that display a range of colors, including deep green, purple, and red. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
