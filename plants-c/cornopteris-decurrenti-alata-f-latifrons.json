    "intro": "Cornopteris decurrenti-alata f. latifrons, commonly known as the broad-fronded cliff brake, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive frond morphology. It features elongated, bipinnate fronds with a decurrent base that extends down the stem, giving it a unique appearance. The fronds are typically broad and have a leathery texture, which helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. This fern is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in forest understories where it can access adequate moisture. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its specific ecological niche, making it a notable species in botanical studies."
