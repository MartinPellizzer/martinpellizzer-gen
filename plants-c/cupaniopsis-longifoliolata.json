It is native to eastern Australia, particularly Queensland, and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a distinctive elongated shape with a leathery texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fleshy, orange-red fruits that are an important food source for native wildlife."
