It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in catkins, and its fruits are three-winged capsules that disperse seeds by wind. Cleistanthus holtzii is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its hard, durable wood."
