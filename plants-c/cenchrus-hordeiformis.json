    "intro": "Cenchrus hordeiformis, commonly known as the barleygrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that aids in moisture retention. Cenchrus hordeiformis is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
