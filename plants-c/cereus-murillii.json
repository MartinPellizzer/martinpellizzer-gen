    "intro": "Cereus murillii, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cactus species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and is typically found in rocky, arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system to store water. Cereus murillii is often cultivated for its striking floral display and resilience in dry conditions."
