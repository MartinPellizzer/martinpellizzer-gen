    "intro": "Calonema phaeoclavium, commonly known as the dark-stemmed calonema, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its dark green, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Calonema phaeoclavium is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive foliage and unique flowering habit."
