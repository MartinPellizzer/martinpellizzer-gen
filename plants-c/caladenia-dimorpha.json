    "intro": "Caladenia dimorpha, commonly known as the red-tongued spider orchid, is a species of orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and two distinct types of leaves, hence its scientific name \"dimorpha,\" meaning \"two forms.\" The plant produces a single, curved spike bearing several small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive red lip. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats, often in heathlands or woodland areas. Caladenia dimorpha is a protected species due to its rarity and is often found in specific regions of New South Wales and Victoria."
