    "intro": "Conyza magnimontana, commonly known as the giant cottonweed, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, fluffy seed heads that resemble cotton, which are produced after the plant has bloomed. The species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in open grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are typically hairy and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its wind-dispersed seeds."
