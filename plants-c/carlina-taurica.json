    "intro": "Carlina taurica, commonly known as the Caucasian hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its basal rosette of grey-green, woolly leaves and its showy composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces yellow disk flowers surrounded by violet to purple ray florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Carlina taurica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
