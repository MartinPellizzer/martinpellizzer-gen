    "intro": "Crataegus ludgii, commonly known as the Ludlow hawthorn, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly found in Georgia and South Carolina. The plant is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to lance-shaped leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit, a small, red berry, matures in the fall and is an important food source for birds and small mammals. The Ludlow hawthorn is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
