    "intro": "Cynanchum saepimentorum, commonly known as the Chinese milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to China. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by follicles containing toxic seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in arid regions of northern China. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest in botanical and ecological studies."
