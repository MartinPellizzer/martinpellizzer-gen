    "intro": "Cyperus reineckei, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland environments, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow flowers. Cyperus reineckei is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped inflorescence, which gives it its common name. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
