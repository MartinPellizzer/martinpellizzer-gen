    "intro": "Cistus ramuliflorus, commonly known as the leafy rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing shrub form, with woody stems and dense foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cistus ramuliflorus is well adapted to rocky and coastal environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils."
