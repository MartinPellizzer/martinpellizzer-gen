    "intro": "Croton ventanicola, commonly known as the African croton, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its diverse leaf shapes, ranging from elliptic to ovate. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in cyathia, typical of the spurge family. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties. Croton ventanicola thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories."
