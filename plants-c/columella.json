    "intro": "Columella, commonly known as the columnar stem, is a botanical feature found in certain plants, particularly in the monocot group. It refers to the central, cylindrical structure that supports the plant and contains the vascular tissues. Unlike the typical stem of dicot plants, the columella is solid and does not have a distinct pith or cortex. This structure is essential for providing mechanical support and facilitating the transport of water and nutrients. The presence of a columella is often associated with plants that grow in arid or windy environments where structural strength is crucial."
