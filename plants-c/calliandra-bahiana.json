    "intro": "Calliandra bahiana, commonly known as the Brazilian coral tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Brazil. It is characterized by its bright red, pink, or orange inflorescences that resemble coral, hence its common name. The plant has bipinnately compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets. It thrives in warm, sunny climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Calliandra bahiana is also valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
