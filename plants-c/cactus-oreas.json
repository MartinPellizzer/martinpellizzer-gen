    "intro": "Cactus oreas, commonly known as the desert rose, are succulent plants native to arid regions of the Americas. They possess thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing them to thrive in dry environments. Their leaves are usually reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss and deter herbivores. The plant produces striking flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, often blooming during the warm seasons. Cactus oreas are adapted to extreme temperatures and can survive prolonged droughts due to their specialized anatomy."
