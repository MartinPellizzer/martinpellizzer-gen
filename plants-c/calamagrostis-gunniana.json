    "intro": "Calamagrostis gunniana, commonly known as Gunn's reed, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and feathery panicles that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that adds ornamental value. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
