    "intro": "Chloris polydactyla f. stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous finger grass, is a variant of the finger grass species native to Australia. It is a perennial grass characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes to form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more prominent during the growing season. This form is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native fauna."
