    "intro": "Cyperus planifolius, commonly known as flatleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by water or wind. Cyperus planifolius is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
