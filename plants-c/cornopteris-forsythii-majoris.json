    "intro": "Cornopteris forsythii-majoris, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, robust fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its broad, shield-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, supporting its growth in nutrient-rich soil. The fronds are divided into numerous pinnae, giving it a distinctive and lush appearance."
