    "intro": "Crataegus oxyacantha var. sicula, commonly known as the Sicilian hawthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Europe, particularly Sicily. It is characterized by its thorny branches, elliptical leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and ornamental gardening."
