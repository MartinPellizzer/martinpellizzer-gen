    "intro": "Carex koestlinii var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a muted green, with a dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spikelets along the stems. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical characteristics make it a useful plant for wetland restoration and ornamental gardening in water-retentive environments."
