    "intro": "Carex umbrosa subsp. huetiana, commonly known as the Huet's sedge, is a perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers. This subspecies thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, and the plant is often found in association with other moisture-loving flora. The botanical features of Carex umbrosa subsp. huetiana make it an important component of wetland and riparian ecosystems."
