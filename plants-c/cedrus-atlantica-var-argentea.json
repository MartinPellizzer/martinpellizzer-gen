    "intro": "Cedrus atlantica var. argentea, commonly known as the Atlas cedar with silver foliage, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to the Atlas Mountains of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and its distinctive silvery-blue needles that give it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, typical of the Cupressaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its cold hardiness, it is also suitable for cultivation in temperate climates."
