    "intro": "Chrysosplenium pseudopilosum var. divaricatistylosum, commonly known as the variable-styled chrysosplenium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It typically features delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its flowers are small, clustered in cymes, often with five petals. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
