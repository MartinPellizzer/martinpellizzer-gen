    "intro": "Chirita tubulosa, commonly known as the tubular chirita, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and southern Asia. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial herb, often found in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are usually opposite, ovate, and have a glossy surface, while its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects. Chirita tubulosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
