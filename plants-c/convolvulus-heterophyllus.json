    "intro": "Convolvulus heterophyllus, commonly known as the variable morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its variable leaf shapes and spiral growth habit, which allows it to climb or trail along the ground. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and bloom in the morning. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common weed in disturbed areas. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated in some regions for its beauty."
