    "intro": "Cyclonema hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy cyclonema, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It features woody stems covered in dense, hairy foliage, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, often blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are typically ovate or elliptical, with a slightly waxy texture. Cyclonema hirsutum is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in dry woodlands or savannas."
