    "intro": "Cynoglossum cheirifolium subvar. tubuliflorum, commonly known as the African bellflower, is a flowering plant native to regions of Africa, particularly South Africa. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
