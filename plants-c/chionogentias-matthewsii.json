    "intro": "Chionogentias matthewsii, commonly known as the Matthews' snow gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern China. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it tolerates cold temperatures and strong winds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
