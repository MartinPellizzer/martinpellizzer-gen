    "intro": "Calamagrostis chrysostachya, commonly known as golden threadgrass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It features slender, arching stems that produce dense clusters of golden-yellow panicles, which are its most striking characteristic. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is known for its ornamental value in gardens. Calamagrostis chrysostachya is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
