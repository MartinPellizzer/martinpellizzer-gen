    "intro": "Coilosperma, commonly known as the spiral fern, is a unique plant characterized by its intricate, spiraling fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Asia. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and curl in a helical pattern, giving it a distinctive appearance. Coilosperma thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, round formations along the fronds."
