    "intro": "Castilleja haydenii, commonly known as Hayden's paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vivid red to orange tubular bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often in association with other plants. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with fungi, allowing it to absorb nutrients from host plants. Castilleja haydenii blooms in late spring to early summer, producing small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects."
