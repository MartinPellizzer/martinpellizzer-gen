    "intro": "Carnegiea scoparia, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that bears showy, white or pale pink flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system adapted to arid conditions, allowing it to survive in dry environments. Its leaves are typically reduced to scales, minimizing water loss. Carnegiea scoparia plays an important role in desert ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small animals."
