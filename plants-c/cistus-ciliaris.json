    "intro": "Cistus ciliaris, commonly known as the Algerian rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky environments and has a deep root system for water retention. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss. Cistus ciliaris is also known for its aromatic resins, which have been used in traditional medicine and perfumery."
