    "intro": "Campyloneurum irregulare, commonly known as the irregular clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that form a rosette. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically found at the base of the foliage. Native to moist, shaded environments in the Appalachian region of the United States, it thrives in rocky or acidic soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
