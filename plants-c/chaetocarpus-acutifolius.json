It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical heads. It thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dune environments. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
