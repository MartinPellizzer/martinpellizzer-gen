    "intro": "Curculigo garoensis, commonly known as the Garo mountain arrowhead, is a rare flowering plant native to the northeastern regions of India. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, which includes orchids, and is characterized by its unique, arrowhead-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
