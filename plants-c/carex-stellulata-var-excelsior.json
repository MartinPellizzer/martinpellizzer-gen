    "intro": "Carex stellulata var. excelsior, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or reddish in color. This plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cooler climates."
