    "intro": "Ceratostylis, commonly known as the spike orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. They are characterized by their slender, often hairy stems and clusters of small, greenish or yellowish flowers. Ceratostylis species typically grow in wet, shaded environments such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Their unique floral structure and adaptation to wet habitats make them an interesting subject for botanical study."
