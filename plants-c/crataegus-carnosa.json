It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in spring, followed by red or orange berries in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. Crataegus carnosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
