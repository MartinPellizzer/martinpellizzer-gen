    "intro": "Cynosurus ovatus, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant has slender, arching stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, and it produces small, three-angled seeds. Cynosurus ovatus is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
