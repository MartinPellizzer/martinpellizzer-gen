    "intro": "Cyclosorus moluccanus, commonly known as the Moluccan cyclosorus, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family, characterized by its fern-like appearance. It is a small, terrestrial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features a short rhizome with numerous stolons, and its fronds are usually pinnately compound, with a delicate, feathery appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sorocarps, are clustered in dense, button-like formations on the underside of the fronds. This species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in botanical gardens."
