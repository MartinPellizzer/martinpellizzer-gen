    "intro": "Chaenostoma sessilifolium, commonly known as the sessile-leaf water-cress, is a aquatic plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of sessile, ovate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its reproductive strategy involves both self-pollination and cross-pollination, aided by its insect-pollinated flowers."
