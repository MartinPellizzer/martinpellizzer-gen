    "intro": "Cardamine cordifolia f. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaf water crowfoot, is a variant of the water crowfoot genus characterized by its diminutive, heart-shaped leaves. This plant is typically found in moist, calcareous environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its leaves are arranged alternately along the stem and are often submerged or floating, aiding in photosynthesis in aquatic settings. The flowers are small and white, clustered in umbels, and bloom in early spring. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
