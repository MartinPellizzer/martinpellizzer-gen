    "intro": "Cyrtanthus pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf rain lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few inches, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pale pink, bloom in early spring and are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Cyrtanthus pumilio thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish."
