    "intro": "Calceolus marianus, commonly known as the Marian's hooded orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, hood-shaped flowers that are typically purple or violet in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, showy blooms that attract pollinators like bees and moths. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Calceolus marianus is considered endangered in many areas."
