    "intro": "Cnidium microcarpum, commonly known as Chinese pepper or small-fruited cnidium, is a perennial herb native to Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic, often pungent foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its fruits are tiny, dry, and schizocarpic, splitting into two one-seeded parts when mature. The roots and rhizomes are the primary parts used in traditional medicine and as a spice."
