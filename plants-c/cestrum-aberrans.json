    "intro": "Cestrum aberrans, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that open at night and close by morning. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a strong, sweet scent that attracts nocturnal pollinators like moths. Cestrum aberrans is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and unique blooming pattern."
