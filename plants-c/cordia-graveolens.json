    "intro": "Cordia graveolens, commonly known as the stinking cotton tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that emit a strong, unpleasant odor. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
