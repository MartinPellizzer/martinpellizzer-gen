    "intro": "Cichorium pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf chicory, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters, featuring basal rosettes of dark green, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often cultivated as a leaf vegetable or used in herbal remedies due to its bitter taste and nutritional value. Cichorium pumilum thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens and wildflower meadows."
