    "intro": "Cordula esquirolii, commonly known as the Esquiroli's cordula, is a rare and specialized plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Restionaceae, which includes many species adapted to arid and nutrient-poor environments. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is characterized by its dense, wiry stems and small, needle-like leaves. It produces delicate, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Cordula esquirolii is considered a vulnerable species."
