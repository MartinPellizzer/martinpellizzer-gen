    "intro": "Costus spectabilis, commonly known as the red ginger or spectabilis costus, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and striking, bright red bracts that resemble flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers inside the bracts, which are often overlooked due to the showy appearance of the bracts. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. Costus spectabilis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a potted plant."
