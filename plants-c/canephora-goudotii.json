    "intro": "Canephora goudotii, commonly known as the African coffee plant, is a species of shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is closely related to the coffee genus Coffea. The plant produces small, white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries containing seeds used for coffee production. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its genetic similarity to commercial coffee species, it is of interest in breeding programs for improving coffee resilience and yield."
