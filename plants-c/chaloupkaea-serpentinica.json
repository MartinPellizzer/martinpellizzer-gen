    "intro": "Chaloupkaea serpentinica, commonly known as the serpentinite fern, is a rare and specialized plant that thrives in nutrient-poor, magnesium-rich soils derived from serpentine rock. It is a member of the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds with a distinctive, narrow, and often serrated appearance. The plant is adapted to withstand heavy metal toxicity and low soil fertility, making it an indicator species for serpentine habitats. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typically developing on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
