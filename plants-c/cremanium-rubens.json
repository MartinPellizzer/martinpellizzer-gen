    "intro": "Cremanium rubens, commonly known as the red flame fern, is a striking epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red or orange fronds, which contrast sharply with its dark green stems. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Its leaves are typically pinnate, with a waxy surface that aids in moisture retention. Cremanium rubens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
