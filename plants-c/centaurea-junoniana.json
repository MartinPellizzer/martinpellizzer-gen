    "intro": "Centaurea junoniana, commonly known as the Junon's cornflower, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to southern Europe and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often in alpine or coastal areas. It produces small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across suitable habitats. Centaurea junoniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
