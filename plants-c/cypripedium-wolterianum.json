    "intro": "Cypripedium wolterianum, commonly known as the Wolter's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pinkish-brown color and intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forests and thrives in cool, humid climates. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, and it produces a single, upright flower stem each year. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
