    "intro": "Centropogon prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate centropogon, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a low-growing herbaceous plant with slender, creeping stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture that helps it thrive in dry conditions. Centropogon prostratus is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils."
