    "intro": "Croton huberi, commonly known as the dwarf croton, is a small shrub native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It features striking, palmate leaves with vibrant green and yellow variegation, often adorned with red or orange veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or green, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
