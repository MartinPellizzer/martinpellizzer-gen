    "intro": "Camellia oleifera var. confusa, commonly known as the Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, elliptic leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in clusters, followed by woody, cup-shaped fruits that contain several winged seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other parts of the world. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
