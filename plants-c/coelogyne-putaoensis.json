    "intro": "Coelogyne putaoensis, commonly known as the Putao orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of northern Myanmar. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescence that bears clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its botanical features include strap-like leaves and a complex, branched root system adapted to its tropical environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
