    "intro": "Campanula alpigena, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy coating, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Campanula alpigena is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
