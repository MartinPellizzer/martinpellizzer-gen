    "intro": "Conospermum flexuosum var. laevigatum, commonly known as the smooth-leaved flame bush, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The leaves are smooth and leathery, often with a glossy appearance, and are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. This species thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal flowering and drought tolerance."
