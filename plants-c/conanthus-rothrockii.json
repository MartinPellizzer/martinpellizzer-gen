    "intro": "Conanthus rothrockii, commonly known as Rothrock's conanthus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Appalachian Mountains of the United States. It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth texture, and it has a low-growing habit. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Conanthus rothrockii is considered a threatened species."
