    "intro": "Cousinia princeps, commonly known as the prince's cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cousinia princeps produces small yellow to brown flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle ornamental value to its natural habitat."
