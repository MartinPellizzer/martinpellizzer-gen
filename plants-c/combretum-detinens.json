    "intro": "Combretum detinens, commonly known as the red bush willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often reddish or purple in color. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by capsule fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Combretum detinens is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
