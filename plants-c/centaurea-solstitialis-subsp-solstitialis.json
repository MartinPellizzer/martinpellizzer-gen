    "intro": "Centaurea solstitialis subsp. solstitialis, commonly known as yellow starthistle, is an invasive plant species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and spiny, bristly foliage. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and thrives in full sun, often outcompeting native vegetation. It has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in arid conditions. Due to its rapid growth and seed production, it is considered a significant weed in many regions."
