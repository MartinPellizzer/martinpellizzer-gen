    "intro": "Castilleja lapponica, commonly known as the Lapland milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant native to arctic and alpine regions of northern Europe and North America. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers, which bloom in late summer. It typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold climates. Castilleja lapponica plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its environment, contributing to nutrient cycling and providing nectar for pollinators."
