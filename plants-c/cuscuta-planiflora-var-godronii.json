    "intro": "Cuscuta planiflora var. godronii, commonly known as the Godron's dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, where it often infests grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, allowing it to spread to new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host plants and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
