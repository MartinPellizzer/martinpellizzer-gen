    "intro": "Cereus parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a succulent plant characterized by its tall, spiny stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from the soil after rare rainfall. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The flowers are typically short-lived but attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths."
