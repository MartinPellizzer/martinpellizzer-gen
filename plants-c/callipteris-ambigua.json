    "intro": "Callipteris ambigua, commonly known as the Florida sand pine, is a shrub-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and pine flatwoods. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
