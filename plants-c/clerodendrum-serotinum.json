    "intro": "Clerodendrum serotinum, commonly known as the late-flowering clerodendrum, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to several meters in height, featuring opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late summer to early autumn. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Clerodendrum serotinum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
