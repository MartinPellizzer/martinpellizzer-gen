    "intro": "Carex flacca subsp. erythrostachys, commonly known as the red-stalked sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of East Asia. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often reddish at the base, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, three-parted flowers. It plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
