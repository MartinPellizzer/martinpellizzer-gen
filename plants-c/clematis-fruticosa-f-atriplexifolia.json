    "intro": "Clematis fruticosa f. atriplexifolia, commonly known as the purpleleaf clematis, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dark purple to almost black foliage, which provides striking visual contrast against its white or pale pink flowers. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are typically borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, sandy soils. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
