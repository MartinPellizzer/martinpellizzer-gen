    "intro": "Cyathea semiamplectens, commonly known as the broad-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in persistent, fibrous roots. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length, contributing to its dramatic appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting pollinators."
