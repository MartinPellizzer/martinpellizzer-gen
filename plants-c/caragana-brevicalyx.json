    "intro": "Caragana brevicalyx, commonly known as the narrowleaf shrub or Chinese sandthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often thorny stems and small, compound leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in length. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, edible pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy plant suitable for reclamation of degraded lands. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil structure."
