    "intro": "Carex motuoensis, commonly known as the Motuo sedge, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants commonly found in wet or moist environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, shaded habitats and is often found in alpine meadows and forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, Carex motuoensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
