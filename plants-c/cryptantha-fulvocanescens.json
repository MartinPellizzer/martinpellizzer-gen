    "intro": "Cryptantha fulvocanescens, commonly known as the yellow globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its globular, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its fruit is a dry pod that splits open to release seeds, a common reproductive strategy in the legume family. Cryptantha fulvocanescens is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility."
