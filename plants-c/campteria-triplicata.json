    "intro": "Campteria triplicata, commonly known as the three-lobed milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters and attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Campteria triplicata plays a role in supporting local ecosystems, particularly as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
