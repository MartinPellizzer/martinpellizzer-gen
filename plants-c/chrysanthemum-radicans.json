    "intro": "Chrysanthemum radicans, commonly known as the creeping chrysanthemum, is a flowering plant native to Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant, daisy-like flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant features hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that attract pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and hanging baskets. Its ability to spread and form dense mats makes it both ornamental and useful for erosion control."
