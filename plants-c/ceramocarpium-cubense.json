    "intro": "Ceramocarpium cubense, commonly known as the Cuban ceramocarpium, is a rare and unique plant native to Cuba. It belongs to the family Ceramocarpiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, hard, seed-bearing structures called ceramocarps. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the specific microclimates of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
