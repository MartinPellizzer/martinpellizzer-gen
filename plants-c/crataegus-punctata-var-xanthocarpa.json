    "intro": "Crataegus punctata var. xanthocarpa, commonly known as the yellow-fruited hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and thorny branches, which are typical of the Crataegus genus. The plant produces white to pink flowers in spring, followed by small, yellow-orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins, and they turn red or orange in autumn. The fruit is edible but often tart, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
