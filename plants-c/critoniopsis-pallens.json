    "intro": "Critoniopsis pallens, commonly known as the pale orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine regions where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Critoniopsis pallens is considered a rare and endangered species."
