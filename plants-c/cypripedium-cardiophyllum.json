    "intro": "Cypripedium cardiophyllum, commonly known as the heart-leaved lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a heart-shaped pouch, which is a distinctive feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in cool, shaded forest habitats, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, contributing to its common name, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
