    "intro": "Cerastium alpinum f. pulvinata, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its compact growth habit and frost-resistant nature make it a hardy addition to alpine gardens."
