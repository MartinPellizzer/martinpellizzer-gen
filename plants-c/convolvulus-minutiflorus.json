It is a low-growing, trailing plant with small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of purple and blue. The leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are slender and often twining. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its rapid growth and ornamental flowers make it both a beautiful and sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
