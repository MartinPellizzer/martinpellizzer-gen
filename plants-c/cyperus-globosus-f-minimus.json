It features dense, tufted clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that grow from a short, rhizomatous stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in water gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for landscaping in humid climates."
