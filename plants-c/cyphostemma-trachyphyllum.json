    "intro": "Cyphostemma trachyphyllum, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, woody stem with a rough, bark-like texture and is often used as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Cyphostemma trachyphyllum is well adapted to dry environments and requires minimal water once established."
