It is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its scientific name reflects its tongue-like appearance, with \"cynoglossum\" meaning dog's tongue in Greek. The species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
