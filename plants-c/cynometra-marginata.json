    "intro": "Cynometra marginata, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical tree native to Africa and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Sterculiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits. Its seeds are encased in a hard, fibrous pulp and are dispersed by animals. The wood of Cynometra marginata is valued for its durability and is used in furniture and construction."
