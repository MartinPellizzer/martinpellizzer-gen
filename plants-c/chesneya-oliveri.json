    "intro": "Chesneya oliveri, commonly known as the Oliver's chesneya, is a rare and striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces tall, slender stems with showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its foliage consists of strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chesneya oliveri is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
