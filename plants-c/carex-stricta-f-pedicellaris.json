    "intro": "Carex stricta f. pedicellaris, commonly known as the slender bulblet sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. This subspecies is notable for its distinctive inflorescence, which features elongated pedicels that distinguish it from other Carex species."
