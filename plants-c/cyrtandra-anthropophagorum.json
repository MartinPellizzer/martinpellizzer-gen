    "intro": "Cyrtandra anthropophagorum, commonly known as the human-eating plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Gesneriaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in the rainforests of Borneo and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a reddish throat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Despite its ominous common name, it is not actually toxic or harmful to humans, though its name may have originated from local folklore or misinterpretation of its ecological role."
