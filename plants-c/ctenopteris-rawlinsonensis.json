    "intro": "Ctenopteris rawlinsonensis, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, providing structural support and enabling it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are bioluminescent in some cases, adding to its unique botanical features."
