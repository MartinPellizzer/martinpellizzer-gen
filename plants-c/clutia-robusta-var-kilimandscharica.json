    "intro": "Clutia robusta var. kilimandscharica, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro clutia, is a shrub native to East Africa, particularly found in the mountainous regions of Tanzania and Kenya. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested or rocky habitats at higher elevations. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in tropical and subtropical regions."
