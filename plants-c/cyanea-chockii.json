    "intro": "Cyanea chockii, commonly known as the Hawaiian sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the island of Moloka'i in Hawaii. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of its habitat. Cyanea chockii is also notable for its fibrous, woody stems and its role in traditional Hawaiian culture. However, it is considered endangered due to habitat loss and invasive species."
