    "intro": "Casuarina filiformis, commonly known as the slender she-oak, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals around the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found in coastal dunes and heathlands. Casuarina filiformis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
