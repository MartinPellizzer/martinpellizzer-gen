It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, with four petals arranged in a cross shape, characteristic of the Brassicaceae family. Its leaves are usually basal, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitats."
