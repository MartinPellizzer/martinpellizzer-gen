    "intro": "Calliandra eriophylla var. eriophylla, commonly known as the silky calliandra, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its feathery, pink to red bracts that are often mistaken for flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, adding visual interest to the foliage. Its leaves are bipinnate, with numerous small leaflets that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils with full sun."
