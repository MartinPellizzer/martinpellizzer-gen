    "intro": "Carex juncella, commonly known as slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowering spikes. Native to moist environments such as wet meadows and stream banks, it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled, spike-like fruits. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
