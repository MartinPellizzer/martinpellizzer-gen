    "intro": "Coppensia bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the wet tropical forests of New Guinea. It is characterized by its distinctive bicoloration, featuring a combination of green and white or pink hues on its leaves and flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in its natural habitat. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, Coppensia bicolor is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
