    "intro": "Cycas szechuanensis subsp. fairylakea, commonly known as the Fairy Lake cycad, is a rare and ancient gymnosperm native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive, stout trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
