    "intro": "Calliandra houstoniana var. houstoniana, commonly known as the Houstonia calliandra, is a deciduous shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features compound leaves with numerous small, elliptical leaflets that are often adorned with a fine, white or pale green pubescence. The plant produces striking, bright red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in dense, spherical clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria."
