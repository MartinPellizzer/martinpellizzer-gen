    "intro": "Calligonum soongaricum, commonly known as the Central Asian spurge, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, which are typically followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is adapted to harsh environments, showing resistance to drought and poor soil conditions. Calligonum soongaricum plays a role in stabilizing soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
