    "intro": "Carex oederi var. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for wetland gardens and ecological restoration projects."
