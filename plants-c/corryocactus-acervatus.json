    "intro": "Corryocactus acervatus, commonly known as the clustered cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters, forming a low, compact shrub. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming during the dry season. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores. Corryocactus acervatus is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
