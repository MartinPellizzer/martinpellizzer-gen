    "intro": "Cochlearia excelsa, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pungent odor. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often at high elevations where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and bear clusters of yellow flowers. Cochlearia excelsa is a hardy perennial that plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat."
