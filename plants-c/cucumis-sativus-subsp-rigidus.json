    "intro": "Cucumis sativus subsp. rigidus, commonly known as the rigid cucumber, is a subspecies of the common cucumber. It is characterized by its thick, waxy skin and generally smaller, more compact fruit compared to typical cucumbers. This subspecies is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, where it thrives in warm, temperate climates. The plant produces monoecious flowers, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. It is often cultivated for its edible fruit, which has a crisp texture and mild flavor."
