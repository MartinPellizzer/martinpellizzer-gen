    "intro": "Cynoxylon japonicum, commonly known as the Japanese ironwood, is a rare and hardy plant native to Japan. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its dense, fibrous trunk. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with long, slender leaflets that provide a striking visual appearance. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable and endangered species in its native habitat."
