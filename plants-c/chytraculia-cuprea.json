    "intro": "Chytraculia cuprea, commonly known as the copper cup fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, copper-colored fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are embedded in the undersides of its leaves. Chytraculia cuprea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
