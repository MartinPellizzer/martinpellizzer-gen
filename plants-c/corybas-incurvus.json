This terrestrial herbaceous plant is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant's leaves are lanceolate and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Corybas incurvus is known for its striking floral structure and is a subject of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological and evolutionary significance."
