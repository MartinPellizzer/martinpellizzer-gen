    "intro": "Carpinus stipulata, commonly known as the Japanese hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Carpinus stipulata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
