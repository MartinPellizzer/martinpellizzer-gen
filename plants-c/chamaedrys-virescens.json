    "intro": "Chamaedrys virescens, commonly known as the green alpine speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, bright green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces delicate blue or violet flowers in the spring, which are clustered in pairs along the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh conditions."
