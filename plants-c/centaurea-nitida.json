It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Centaurea nitida is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
