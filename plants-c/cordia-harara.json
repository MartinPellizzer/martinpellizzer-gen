It is native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. It thrives in brackish water environments and plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems. Its fruits are small, berry-like structures that split open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
