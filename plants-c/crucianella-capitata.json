    "intro": "Crucianella capitata, commonly known as the sea bean or sea bean plant, is a small flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands. It is a member of the Violaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of tiny blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline environments and is often found growing on rocky shores or in coastal dunes. Its seeds are enclosed in small, hard pods and are adapted for dispersal by water. Crucianella capitata plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and is of interest in ecological studies due to its unique adaptations to harsh maritime conditions."
