    "intro": "Coelogyne calcicola, commonly known as the limestone orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows on limestone cliffs and rocky substrates, adapting to nutrient-poor environments. Its leaves are strap-like and arranged in a rosette, and it produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Coelogyne calcicola is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
