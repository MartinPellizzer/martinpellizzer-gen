    "intro": "Canna, commonly known as the \"hardy banana,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to the Americas. It features large, showy leaves that can reach up to several feet in length, often with a waxy texture. The plant produces striking, spadix-bearing inflorescences surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Canna species are typically herbaceous perennials, though some varieties can be shrubs or even trees in certain climates. They are valued in gardens for their ornamental foliage and long blooming period."
