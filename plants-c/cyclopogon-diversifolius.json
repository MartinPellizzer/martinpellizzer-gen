    "intro": "Cyclopogon diversifolius, commonly known as the variable-leaf cyclopogon, is a species of flowering plant in the family Poaceae. It is native to the Caribbean and is characterized by its unique, often asymmetrical leaf shapes. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its inflorescence consists of dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that are often green or reddish in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
