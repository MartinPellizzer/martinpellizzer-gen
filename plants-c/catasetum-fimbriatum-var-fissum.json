It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated pseudobulbs and showy, fragrant flowers that often display a striking contrast of colors. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understorey of forests. Its flowers are specialized for pollination by bees, featuring a unique structure that facilitates the transfer of pollen. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
