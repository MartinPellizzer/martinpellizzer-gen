    "intro": "Corydalis flexuosa f. bulbillifera, commonly known as the bulbillifera corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of pink to purple flowers. The plant produces bulbils, which are small vegetative propagules that allow it to spread easily in suitable habitats. These bulbils are often found at the base of the stems, contributing to its reproductive strategy. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or shaded areas."
