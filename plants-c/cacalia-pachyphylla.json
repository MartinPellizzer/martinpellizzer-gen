    "intro": "Cacalia pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a notable species in botanical gardens and native plant collections."
