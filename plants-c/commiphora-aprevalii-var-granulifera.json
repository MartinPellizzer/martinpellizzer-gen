    "intro": "Commiphora aprevalii var. granulifera, commonly known as the granulated myrrh tree, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Burseraceae family. It is native to specific regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and Angola, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its thick, rugged bark and produces a resinous sap that has been historically used for medicinal and aromatic purposes. Its small, leathery leaves and inconspicuous flowers are adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
