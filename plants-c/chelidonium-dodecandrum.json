    "intro": "Chelidonium dodecandrum, commonly known as the twelve-branchedcelandine, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Papaveraceae. It is characterized by its yellow, saucer-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It has a taproot system and produces a milky sap that contains alkaloids. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments."
