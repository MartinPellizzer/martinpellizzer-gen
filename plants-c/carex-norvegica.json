    "intro": "Carex norvegica, commonly known as the Norway sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of brownish or greenish flowers, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Carex norvegica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
