It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. This variety is noted for its compact form and is sometimes used in ornamental gardening or as a cover crop."
