It belongs to the family Menispermaceae and is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves and showy, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Its roots and stems contain various alkaloids, which have been studied for potential medicinal properties. Cocculus kunstleri is often found in moist, shaded areas within forests and is valued for its ornamental appearance."
