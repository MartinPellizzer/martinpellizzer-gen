    "intro": "Coleus subulatus, commonly known as the needleleaf coleus, is a striking ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often brightly colored in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, arranged in whorled clusters along the stems. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated for its vibrant foliage rather than its flowers. Coleus subulatus is a popular choice for gardeners seeking to add visual interest to containers or shaded garden beds."
