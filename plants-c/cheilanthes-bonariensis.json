    "intro": "Cheilanthes bonariensis, commonly known as the Argentine rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with tufted, lance-shaped fronds that are usually evergreen. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This resilient fern is well adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making it a common sight in its native habitats across South America."
