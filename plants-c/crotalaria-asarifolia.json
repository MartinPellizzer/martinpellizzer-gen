    "intro": "Crotalaria asarifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf velvet bean, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain toxic seeds, which are sometimes used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Crotalaria asarifolia is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
