    "intro": "Cleistes venusta, commonly known as the sweet-pink orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and the coastal regions of Georgia. The plant features a delicate, bell-shaped flower with a distinctive pinkish-white color and a strong, sweet fragrance. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, often growing in a rosette pattern. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cleistes venusta is considered a rare and endangered species."
