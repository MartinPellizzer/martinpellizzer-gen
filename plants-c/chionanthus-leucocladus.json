    "intro": "Chionanthus leucocladus, commonly known as the white fringe tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring, often in clusters along the branches. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. Its fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Chionanthus leucocladus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to a variety of soil types."
