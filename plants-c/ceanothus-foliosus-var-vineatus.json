    "intro": "Ceanothus foliosus var. vineatus, commonly known as the vine-like ceanothus, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or dry landscapes. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
