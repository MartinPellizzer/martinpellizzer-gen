It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually hairy, giving it a rough texture, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Cryptantha hispida is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas."
