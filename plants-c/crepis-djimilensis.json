    "intro": "Crepis djimilensis, commonly known as the Djimilensis hawkweed, is a flowering plant species belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and basal leaves that are often spoon-shaped. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Himalayas, where it thrives in rocky and alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species within its native range."
