    "intro": "Cladocolea microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved cliff heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a low-growing shrub with small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Cladocolea microphylla plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
