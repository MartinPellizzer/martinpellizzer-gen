    "intro": "Cuscuta segetum, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive appearance with numerous slender, thread-like stems. The plant attaches to its host using specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's tissues. It is often found on crops such as corn, wheat, and barley, making it a significant agricultural pest. Its life cycle involves producing seeds that can remain viable in the soil for many years."
