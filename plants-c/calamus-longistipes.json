    "intro": "Calamus longistipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible, starchy rhizomes that are used in traditional cuisine. Its growth habit makes it well-suited for humid, shaded environments in lowland forests. The rhizomes are also valued for their medicinal properties in some cultures."
