    "intro": "Chengiodendron matsumuranum, commonly known as the Chinese red sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to China. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by small, round fruits containing single seeds. It is valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been traditionally used in furniture and carving. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
