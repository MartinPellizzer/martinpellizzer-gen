    "intro": "Calamagrostis nitidula, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Calamagrostis nitidula is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
