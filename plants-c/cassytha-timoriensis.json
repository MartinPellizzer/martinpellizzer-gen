    "intro": "Cassytha timoriensis, commonly known as the tropical dodder, is a parasitic vine native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants using specialized structures called haustoria, which extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found growing on shrubs and trees in humid environments. Its rapid growth and invasive tendencies make it a significant weed in agricultural areas. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat for certain insects and small animals."
