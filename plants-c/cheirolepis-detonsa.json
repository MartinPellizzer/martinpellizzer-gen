    "intro": "Cheirolepis detonsa, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the southern United States. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments. The plant has dark green, leathery fronds that are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. It produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori. Cheirolepis detonsa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky habitats."
