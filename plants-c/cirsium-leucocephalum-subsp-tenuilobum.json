    "intro": "Cirsium leucocephalum subsp. tenuilobum, commonly known as the slender-leaved thistle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and western Asia. It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, often with a reddish tint. The plant produces large, showy composite flowers with white ray florets and yellow disk florets, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine, prickly hairs, contributing to its defensive characteristics. This subspecies is often found in grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
