    "intro": "Carex funingensis, commonly known as the Funing sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Native to specific regions in Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively. Carex funingensis is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants in its native habitat."
