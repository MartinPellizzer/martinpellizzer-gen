    "intro": "Cyclopogon plantagineus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
