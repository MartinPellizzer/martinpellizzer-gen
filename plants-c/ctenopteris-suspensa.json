    "intro": "Ctenopteris suspensa, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, pinnate fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a creeping underground stem that produces both roots and new shoots. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, a unique feature that helps in attracting pollinators. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
