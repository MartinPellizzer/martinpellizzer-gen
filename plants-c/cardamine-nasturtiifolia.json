    "intro": "Cardamine nasturtiifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf watercress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive, peppery aroma, and its small white flowers are clustered in racemes. It has a shallow root system and is often found in wetland habitats. Due to its preference for cool, moist conditions, it is sometimes cultivated as a leafy vegetable in traditional Asian cuisines."
