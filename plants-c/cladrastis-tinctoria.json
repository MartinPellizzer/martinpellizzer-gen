It is characterized by its showy, pendulous clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has compound leaves that are alternate and pinnately arranged, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets. Its fruit is a distinctive, inflated capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Cladrastis tinctoria is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in dye production."
