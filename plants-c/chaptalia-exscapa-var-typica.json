It features upright stems covered in fine, white hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
