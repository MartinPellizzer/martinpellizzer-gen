    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis yanqianii, commonly known as the Yunnan ironwood, is a large evergreen tree native to China. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by oval-shaped nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. It thrives in humid, subtropical climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native habitat."
