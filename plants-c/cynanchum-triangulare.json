    "intro": "Cynanchum triangulare, commonly known as the three-angled milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a distinct three-angled cross-section. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Cynanchum triangulare is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
