    "intro": "Calyptrogyne panamensis subsp. centralis, commonly known as the Central American mangrove, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline and brackish water environments. It is characterized by its fibrous roots, which help stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion. The plant has small, ovate leaves with a waxy surface that reduces water loss in high-salinity conditions. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, and its fruits are capsule-like structures containing numerous seeds. This subspecies is an important component of mangrove ecosystems in Central America, providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
