    "intro": "Caragana microphylla f. cinerea, commonly known as the grey-leaved shrub or silverleaf caragana, is a frost-tolerant shrub native to the cold climates of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are densely covered with a silvery-grey pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments. This variety is particularly valued for its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
