    "intro": "Cuscuta xanthochortos, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment. It produces small, yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host to extract nutrients. The plant is native to various regions in the Americas and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively. Due to its parasitic nature, it can sometimes cause harm to its host plants, particularly in agricultural settings."
