    "intro": "Chondrilla sonchifolia, commonly known as the common milkweed, is a herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that resemble dandelions. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a distinguishing feature and can be toxic to some animals. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and disturbed soils, and is often found in open areas with full sun. Chondrilla sonchifolia plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid growth and spread."
