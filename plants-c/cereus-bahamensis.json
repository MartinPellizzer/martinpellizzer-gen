    "intro": "Cereus bahamensis, commonly known as the Bahamian candleplant, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces large, white, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in tropical climates."
