    "intro": "Calamus brassii, commonly known as the broad-leaved calamus, is a member of the Arecaceae family, native to Southeast Asia. It is a tall, slender plant that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often ribbed and have a glossy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in dense inflorescences. Its rhizomes are often harvested for their aromatic properties and used in traditional medicine. Calamus brassii thrives in wet, swampy areas and requires high humidity and well-draining soil for optimal growth."
