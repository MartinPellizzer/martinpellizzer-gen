    "intro": "Chenopodium album var. laciniatum, commonly known as curly leaf goosefoot, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and is often found in temperate climates. Its small greenish-white flowers are arranged in clusters and are wind-pollinated. The species is known for its rapid growth and is sometimes considered a weed, though it has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
