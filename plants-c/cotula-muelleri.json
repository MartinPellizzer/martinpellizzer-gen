It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers. The plant has a low-growing habit with silver-gray foliage that reflects light, giving it a distinctive appearance. Cotula muelleri typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
