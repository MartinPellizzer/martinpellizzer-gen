It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that are arranged in a single, terminal head. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. This variety is distinguished by its entire leaf margins, which set it apart from other varieties within the Crepis genus."
