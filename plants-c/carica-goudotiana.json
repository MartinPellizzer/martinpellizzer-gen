    "intro": "Carica goudotiana, commonly known as the Goudot's papaya, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Caricaceae family and is characterized by its large, lobed leaves and yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces a fleshy, aromatic fruit that is similar in appearance to the common papaya but is less widely cultivated. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
