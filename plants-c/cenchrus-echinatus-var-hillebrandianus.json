    "intro": "Cenchrus echinatus var. hillebrandianus, commonly known as the hairy fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous root system and erect, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and the plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to well-drained soils and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. This variety is often used in erosion control due to its rapid growth and hardy nature."
