    "intro": "Cistanche armena, commonly known as the Armenian dodder, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to members of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers and has a distinctive, branched stem covered in small, scale-like leaves. It is native to regions of the Mediterranean and Central Asia, often growing in dry, arid environments. Due to its parasitic nature and medicinal uses in traditional medicine, it is of interest to botanists and pharmacologists alike."
