    "intro": "Carex turkestanica subsp. beleensis, commonly known as the Turkestan sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is native to Central Asia and thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, contributing to soil stabilization. The plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
