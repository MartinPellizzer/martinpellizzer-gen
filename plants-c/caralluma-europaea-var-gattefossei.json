It features fleshy, cylindrical stems covered in soft, spiny tubercles. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that develop into inflated, lantern-shaped fruits. The fruit's outer husk turns from green to red or orange as it matures. It is adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
