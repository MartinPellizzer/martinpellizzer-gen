It is characterized by its tall, trunk-like stem covered with a fibrous, brownish outer layer. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Cyathea medullaris thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its unique structure and growth pattern make it an important component of tropical ecosystems."
