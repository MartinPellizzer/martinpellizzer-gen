    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. indivisa, commonly known as the European hazel, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed leaves and clusters of edible nuts encased in a spiky husk. The plant produces yellow male catkins and female flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in hedgerows or woodland edges. The nuts are an important food source for wildlife and have been used historically in human diets and traditional medicine."
