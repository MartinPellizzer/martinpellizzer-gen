    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris subf. gracilis, commonly known as slender heather, is a low-growing shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. This sub-species thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and moorlands. Its growth habit is generally more upright and slender compared to the typical form of Calluna vulgaris. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
