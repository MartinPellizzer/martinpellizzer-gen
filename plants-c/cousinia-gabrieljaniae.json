    "intro": "Cousinia gabrieljaniae, commonly known as Gabriel's tarweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in dense, daisy-like heads. It has hairy, grayish-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Cousinia gabrieljaniae is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient species in semi-desert conditions."
