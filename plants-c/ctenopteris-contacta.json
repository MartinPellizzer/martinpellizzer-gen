It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with narrow, closely spaced pinnae that give the plant a feathery appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found growing on rocky surfaces or in coastal areas. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
