    "intro": "Choristylis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with elongated, pale green leaves and a single, showy flower that resembles a ghostly figure. Native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments with high moisture levels. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its habitat specificity and sensitivity to environmental changes, Choristylis is considered a critically endangered species."
