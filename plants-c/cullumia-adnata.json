    "intro": "Cullumia adnata, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water. Its showy, bell-shaped flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in the spring. Cullumia adnata has adapted to survive in harsh conditions with deep roots and a slow growth cycle."
