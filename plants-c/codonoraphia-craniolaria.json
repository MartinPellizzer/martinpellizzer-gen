    "intro": "Codonoraphia craniolaria, commonly known as the skullcap plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its flowers are small, white to pale yellow, and arranged in compound umbels, which attract pollinators like bees and flies. The fruit is a dry, two-lobed schizocarp that splits into two one-seeded parts upon maturity."
