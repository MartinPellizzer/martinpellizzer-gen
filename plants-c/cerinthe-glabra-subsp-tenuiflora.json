    "intro": "Cerinthe glabra subsp. tenuiflora, commonly known as narrow-flowered cerinthe, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
