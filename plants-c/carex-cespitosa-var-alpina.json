It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually brown or reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
