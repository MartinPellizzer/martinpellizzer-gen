    "intro": "Cercidium viride, commonly known as the green honey mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often deciduous during the dry season. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are pollinated by insects, and its fruit is a legume containing edible seeds. Cercidium viride is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
