    "intro": "Caladenia filamentosa var. filifera, commonly known as the thread-leaved spider-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves and its striking, spider-like flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces a single, erect stem that bears several small, delicate flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as heathlands and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
