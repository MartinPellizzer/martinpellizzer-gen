    "intro": "Claytonia unalaschkensis, commonly known as the Alaskan spring beauty, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Alaska and northern British Columbia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of 5 to 15 centimeters. The plant features rosettes of fleshy, broad leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its cool, moist habitat. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and appear in early spring, usually between March and May. Claytonia unalaschkensis thrives in rocky, coastal environments and is adapted to the short growing season of its native range."
