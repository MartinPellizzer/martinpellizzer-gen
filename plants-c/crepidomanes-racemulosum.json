    "intro": "Crepidomanes racemulosum, commonly known as the clustered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has small, fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy bloom, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone conditions."
