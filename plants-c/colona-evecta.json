    "intro": "Colona evecta, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many areas."
