    "intro": "Crataegus uber, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and showy white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries known as haws, which are typically harvested in the fall. Crataegus uber is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and other disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
