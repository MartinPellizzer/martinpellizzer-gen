    "intro": "Campyloneurum lorentzii, commonly known as the Lorentz's curly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, curling fronds that give it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually across the substrate. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of many fern species."
