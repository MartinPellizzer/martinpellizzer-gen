    "intro": "Cryptantha clandestina, commonly known as the hidden bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe habitats. Its seeds are enclosed in small, bladder-like pods, which contribute to its common name. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
