    "intro": "Campium validum, commonly known as the common campion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stem. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Campium validum is often found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges, where it contributes to the floral diversity of these ecosystems."
