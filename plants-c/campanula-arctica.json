    "intro": "Campanula arctica, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It features a low-growing habit with succulent, hairy stems and clustered, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in cold, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Campanula arctica is valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to flourish in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
