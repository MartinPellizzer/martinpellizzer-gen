    "intro": "Caroxylon articulatum, commonly known as the articulated carob tree, is a species native to the Canary Islands. It is a small to medium-sized tree with a distinctive branching pattern and thick, ridged bark. The plant produces long, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds surrounded by a sweet, sticky pulp. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Caroxylon articulatum is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions."
