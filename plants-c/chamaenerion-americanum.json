    "intro": "Chamaenerion americanum, commonly known as fireweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in open fields. The plant produces showy pink to purple flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its stems are often covered in fine hairs, and it has opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Fireweed is known for its ability to thrive in harsh environments and is often one of the first plants to colonize areas after a fire or disturbance."
