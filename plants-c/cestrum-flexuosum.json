    "intro": "Cestrum flexuosum, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshade plants, and is known for its showy, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters, with smooth, often red-barked stems. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and lance-shaped, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a strong scent that attracts nocturnal pollinators like moths. Cestrum flexuosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical and subtropical regions."
