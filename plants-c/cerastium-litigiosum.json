    "intro": "Cerastium litigiosum, commonly known as the common mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, hairy leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Cerastium litigiosum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
