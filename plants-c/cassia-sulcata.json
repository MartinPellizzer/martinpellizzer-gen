    "intro": "Cassia sulcata, commonly known as the African candle bush, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in panicles, which are followed by long, slender pods containing flat, winged seeds. Cassia sulcata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and along riverbanks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
