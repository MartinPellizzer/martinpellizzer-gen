    "intro": "Caladenia turneri, commonly known as the Red-tipped Spider-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Western Australia. It typically grows in sandy soils within heathlands and is characterized by its striking red-tipped, spider-like flowers. The plant features a single, slender stem with a single flower at the top, which is often adorned with intricate patterns. Caladenia turneri is a perennial species that produces its flowers during the cooler months, usually between June and September. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
