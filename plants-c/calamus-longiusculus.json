It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet, swampy environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features a rhizomatous stem system, with long, slender rhizomes that store starch. Its leaves are large, arrowhead-shaped, and often have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually hidden within a spathe, typical of the Aroid family."
