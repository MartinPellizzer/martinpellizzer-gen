    "intro": "Crataegus polybracteata, commonly known as the many-bract hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to elliptic leaves, and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds and mammals but generally unpalatable to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands, streambanks, and thickets. The many-bract hawthorn is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
