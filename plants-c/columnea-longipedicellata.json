It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as a shrub or vine, with opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds, which are attracted to its nectar-rich structure. Columnea longipedicellata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
