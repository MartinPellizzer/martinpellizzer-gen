    "intro": "Coppoleria monantha, commonly known as the single-flowered copple, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, solitary flowers that bloom in a striking shade of purple or pink. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Coppoleria monantha is considered a conservation concern."
