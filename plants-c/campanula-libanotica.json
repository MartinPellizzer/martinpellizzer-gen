    "intro": "Campanula libanotica, commonly known as the Lebanon bellflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and parts of southern Europe. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Campanula libanotica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
