    "intro": "Cutandia maritima, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in saline and windy environments. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming dense mats along the shoreline. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs that reduce water loss and protect against salt spray. Cutandia maritima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize sandy soils in coastal habitats."
