    "intro": "Clematis brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It features slender, twining stems that can reach lengths of up to 10 meters, allowing it to climb trees and shrubs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a hairy texture that distinguishes it from other clematis species. Clematis brevifolia thrives in partial shade to full sun and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
