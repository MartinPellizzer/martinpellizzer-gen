    "intro": "Clidemia matudae, commonly known as Matud\u00e1's mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica and Panama. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy white to pink flowers. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub with opposite, ovate leaves that have a velvety texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rich, humus-filled soils. Clidemia matudae plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
