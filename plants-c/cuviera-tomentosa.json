It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
