    "intro": "Cedrela bogotensis, commonly known as the Colombian cedar, is a tropical tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, aromatic wood. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by elongated, woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an important species for ecological and economic purposes in its native habitat."
