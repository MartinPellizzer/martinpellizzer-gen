    "intro": "Capsella macroclada, commonly known as the large-flowered weed or broadleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lobed leaves and produces small, round fruits called siliques. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it both a weed and a subject of interest in ecological studies."
