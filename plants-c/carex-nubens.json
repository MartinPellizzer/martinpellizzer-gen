    "intro": "Carex nubens, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in harsh environments. Carex nubens is an important component of alpine ecosystems, providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species."
