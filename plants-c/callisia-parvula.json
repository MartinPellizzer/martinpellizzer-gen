    "intro": "Callisia parvula, commonly known as the small-flowered carpetweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Central and South America. It features small, waxy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Callisia parvula is known for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion."
