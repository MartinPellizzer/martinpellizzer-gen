    "intro": "Carex echinochloe var. nyasensis, commonly known as the Nyasae Carex, is a sedge species native to East Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that bloom in the summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
