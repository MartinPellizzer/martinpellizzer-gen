    "intro": "Carex aquatilis var. rhomboidea, commonly known as the rhomboid sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, exhibiting a clumping growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. Its rhomboid-shaped bracts are a distinguishing feature, contributing to its common name. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
