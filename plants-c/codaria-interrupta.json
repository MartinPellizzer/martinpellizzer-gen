    "intro": "Codaria interrupta, commonly known as the narrowleaf codaria, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with slender, upright stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring and early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in small, three-lobed pods that split open when mature. Codaria interrupta is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and along canyon walls."
