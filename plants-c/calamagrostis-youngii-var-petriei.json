    "intro": "Calamagrostis youngii var. petriei, commonly known as the Petrie's bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and slender, upright growth habit. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 3 feet and produces delicate, panicle-like inflorescences in late summer. Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for native plant gardens and erosion control."
