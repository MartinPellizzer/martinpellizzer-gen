    "intro": "Centaurea dubjanskyi, commonly known as the Dubjansky's cornflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. The plant produces bright blue to purple flower heads, which are composed of numerous small, tubular florets arranged in a composite structure. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or open habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
