It is characterized by its fragrant, night-opening flowers that emit a strong, sweet aroma. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its leaves are broad and dark green, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters. Cleisostoma lendyanum is prized in horticulture for its unique nocturnal blooming habit and ornamental value."
