    "intro": "Camaridium fragrans, commonly known as the sweet-scented orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy texture, while its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air. The flowers emit a subtle, sweet aroma, making it a popular choice for ornamental cultivation."
