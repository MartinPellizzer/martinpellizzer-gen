    "intro": "Carex alopecoidea var. sparsispicata, commonly known as the sparse-bracted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, bogs, and wet meadows. Its flowers are small and clustered, with the male and female flowers usually separated into distinct spikelets. This variety is notable for its sparse, short bracts that distinguish it from other Carex species."
