    "intro": "Campanula scheuchzeri var. valdensis, commonly known as the Valdensis bellflower, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous areas. Its leaves are basal, lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs, which help it withstand harsh environmental conditions. This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its historical significance and limited distribution."
