    "intro": "Ceropegia rupicola, commonly known as the rock ceropegia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing stems and small, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces unique, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which attract specific pollinators like moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in warm climates."
