    "intro": "Cocculus perraudi, commonly known as the Indian cocklebur, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Menispermaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by spiny, berry-like fruits that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption but is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
