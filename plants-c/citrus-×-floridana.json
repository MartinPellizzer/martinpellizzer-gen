It is a hybrid citrus plant resulting from the cross between the grapefruit (Citrus \u00d7 paradisi) and the pomelo (Citrus maxima). This species is characterized by its large, rough-skinned fruits that are typically orange to reddish in color. The leaves are dark green, oval-shaped, and have a slightly serrated margin. It thrives in subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its fruit, which is used in juices and as a source of vitamin C."
