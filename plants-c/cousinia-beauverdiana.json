    "intro": "Cousinia beauverdiana, commonly known as the mountain fritillary, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form adapted to harsh, arid environments. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow, grayish-green, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. Cousinia beauverdiana is often found in rocky slopes and alpine meadows, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soils."
