    "intro": "Carex ornithopoda subsp. ornithopoda, commonly known as the bird-foot sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is typically found in wet or moist environments such as marshes, wetlands, and along stream banks. It has rhizomatous growth and can form dense colonies, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
