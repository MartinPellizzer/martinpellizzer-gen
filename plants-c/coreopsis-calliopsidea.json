    "intro": "Coreopsis calliopsidea, commonly known as the narrowleaf coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and wetlands. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces bright yellow flowers with a distinctive, narrow tube. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its showy, composite flower heads. Coreopsis calliopsidea is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
