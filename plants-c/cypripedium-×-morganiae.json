    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 morganiae, commonly known as the Morgan's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments and has rhizomatous roots that help it anchor in soil. Its flowers are usually pink or white with a yellow or orange lip, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific care to thrive."
