    "intro": "Calyptrocalyx bifurcatus, commonly known as the two-branched calyptrocalyx, is a rare flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive calyx that splits into two lobes, giving it its specific epithet \"bifurcatus.\" The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, with five petals that are usually pale pink to white in color. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its native range."
