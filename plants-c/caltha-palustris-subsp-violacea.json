    "intro": "Caltha palustris subsp. violacea, commonly known as the purple marsh marigold, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features showy, violet-pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often before its leaves emerge. The plant has basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a waxy surface, and its stems are typically hairy. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
