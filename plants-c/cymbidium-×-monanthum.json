    "intro": "Cymbidium \u00d7 monanthum, commonly known as the Chinese orchid or the ever-blooming orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear multiple flowers in a dense cluster. The plant typically produces large, showy blooms in shades of white, pink, and red, often with a distinct fragrance. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a cut flower."
