    "intro": "Centaurea pedemontana, commonly known as the Piedmont star-thistle, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features wiry, spiny stems and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with rough, hairy surfaces, and its flowers are typically arranged in dense, spherical clusters. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
