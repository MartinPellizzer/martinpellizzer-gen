    "intro": "Castilleja pallida var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of western North America. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in open, rocky habitats such as alpine meadows and grasslands. Its leaves are usually linear and its stems are erect, contributing to its distinctive appearance in its native environment."
