    "intro": "Cardamine impatiens var. tenuissima, commonly known as slender water-cress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a slightly succulent texture, and small white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in suitable habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
