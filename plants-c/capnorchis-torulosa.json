    "intro": "Capnorchis torulosa, commonly known as the torulose orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a loose raceme, which bloom during the late summer and early autumn. Capnorchis torulosa is known for its preference for shaded, moist environments in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
