    "intro": "Cyathea crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in persistent, fibrous roots and a crown of large, pinnately divided fronds. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swamps. Its fronds can grow up to several meters in length, contributing to its ornamental value. Cyathea crassifolia plays a role in tropical ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
