    "intro": "Cerastium amblyodontum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 inch long, and it often forms a mat-like growth habit. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Cerastium amblyodontum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
