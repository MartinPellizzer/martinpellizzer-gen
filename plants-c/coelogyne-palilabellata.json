    "intro": "Coelogyne palilabellata, commonly known as the pink-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that typically feature a pink lip and white or pale yellow petals. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Coelogyne palilabellata is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its beauty and fragrance."
