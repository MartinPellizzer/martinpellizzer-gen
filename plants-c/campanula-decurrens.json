    "intro": "Campanula decurrens, commonly known as the spreading bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that often spread along the ground, forming a low, carpet-like growth. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Campanula decurrens is well-suited for rock gardens and moist, shady environments."
