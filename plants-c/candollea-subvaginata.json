    "intro": "Candollea subvaginata, commonly known as the narrow sheath fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense forests. Its rhizomes are slender and creeping, supporting the growth of its pinnate leaves. The spore-producing structures, or sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
