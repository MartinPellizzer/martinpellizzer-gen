    "intro": "Casearia coriacea, commonly known as roughcasear, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its rough, bark-like texture on its leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a leathery texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Casearia coriacea is often found in moist, shaded areas and is used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
