    "intro": "Calathea exserta, commonly known as the zigzag calathea, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its uniquely patterned, waxy leaves that display a zigzag arrangement of contrasting colors, often in shades of green, silver, and pink. The plant belongs to the Marantaceae family and is prized for its ornamental value in indoor gardening. It thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Calathea exserta is relatively low-maintenance but sensitive to temperature fluctuations and direct sunlight."
