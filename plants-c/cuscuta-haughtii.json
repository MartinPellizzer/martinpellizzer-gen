    "intro": "Cuscuta haughtii, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to North America and often infests crops such as corn and beans. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, making it a persistent weed in agricultural settings. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly reduce the yield of its host plants."
