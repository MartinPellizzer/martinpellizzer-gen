    "intro": "Cynorkis comorensis, commonly known as the Comorian orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Comoros archipelago. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant, and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
