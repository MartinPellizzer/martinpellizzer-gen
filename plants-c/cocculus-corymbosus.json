    "intro": "Cocculus corymbosus, commonly known as the wild yew, is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Berberidaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. Its berries are toxic to humans and animals, containing compounds such as berberine. Despite its toxicity, Cocculus corymbosus has been used historically in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
