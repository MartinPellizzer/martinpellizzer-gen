    "intro": "Cereus pringlei var. calvus, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces striking, night-blooming flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its varietal name, *calvus*, refers to its relatively hairless stem compared to other varieties. It is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in low-water environments."
