    "intro": "Cheirinia wheeleri, commonly known as the Wheeler's cheirinia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, often emitting a subtle scent when crushed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cheirinia wheeleri is considered a vulnerable species."
