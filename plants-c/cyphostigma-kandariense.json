    "intro": "Cyphostigma kandariense, commonly known as the Kandari sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southern regions of India. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small, white flowers. The plant is notable for its hard, durable wood, which has been historically used in traditional crafts and construction. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species in its natural range."
