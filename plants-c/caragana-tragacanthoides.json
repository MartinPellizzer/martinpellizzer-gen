    "intro": "Caragana tragacanthoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf shrub or desert shrub, is a deciduous shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, followed by legume pods that contain several seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil stabilization and ecological restoration in degraded landscapes."
