    "intro": "Coryanthes jorgemarioi, commonly known as the Jorgemario's hooded orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the tropical rainforests of Colombia. This orchid is characterized by its striking, hood-like floral structure that encloses its reproductive organs, a feature typical of the Coryanthes genus. The plant produces vibrant, colorful flowers that range from red to orange, often with intricate patterns resembling faces or other designs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered a vulnerable species."
