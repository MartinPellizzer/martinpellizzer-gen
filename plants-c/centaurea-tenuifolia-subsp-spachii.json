    "intro": "Centaurea tenuifolia subsp. spachii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved centaury, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing clusters of tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
