    "intro": "Cephaloceraton, commonly known as the helmet fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, helmet-shaped spore cases that are prominently displayed on the underside of its fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. Cephaloceraton plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
