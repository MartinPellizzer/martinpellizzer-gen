    "intro": "Cuphea infundibulum, commonly known as the torch flower, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are typically hidden within the colorful bracts. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cuphea infundibulum is often grown as an ornamental plant for its vibrant and long-lasting display."
