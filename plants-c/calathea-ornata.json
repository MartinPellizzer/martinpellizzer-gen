    "intro": "Calathea ornata, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, patterned leaves that change color in response to light, a phenomenon known as nyctinasty. The leaves typically fold shut at night and unfold in the morning, giving it its common name. Its foliage features intricate veins and a variety of shades of green, silver, and pink. Calathea ornata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to maintain its vibrant appearance."
