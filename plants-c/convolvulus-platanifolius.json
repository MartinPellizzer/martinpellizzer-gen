    "intro": "Convolvulus platanifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped, violet to blue flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is a climbing vine with hairy stems and tendrils that allow it to attach to supports. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or disturbed habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens, though it can become invasive in some regions."
