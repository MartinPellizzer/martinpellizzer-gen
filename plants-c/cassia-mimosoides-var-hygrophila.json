    "intro": "Cassia mimosoides var. hygrophila, commonly known as the water cassia, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that resemble those of the mimosoides species. The plant produces bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. The seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread."
