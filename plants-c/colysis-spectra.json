    "intro": "Colysis spectra, commonly known as the spectrum of plant responses to environmental stress, refers to the range of biochemical and physiological changes observed in plants under various stress conditions. These changes include alterations in chlorophyll content, enzyme activity, and antioxidant levels, which are critical for plant survival. The spectra are often analyzed using advanced spectroscopic techniques to assess plant health and stress tolerance. Understanding colysis spectra helps in developing strategies for improving crop resilience in changing climates. This field integrates botany, ecology, and biotechnology to enhance agricultural sustainability."
