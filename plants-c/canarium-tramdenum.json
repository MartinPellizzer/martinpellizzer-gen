    "intro": "Canarium tramdenum, commonly known as the African oil palm, is a tropical plant native to Africa. It is a member of the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves and tall, straight trunk. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into drupes, which contain a valuable oil-rich seed. Its latex, known as copal, has been used traditionally for its adhesive properties. Canarium tramdenum plays an important ecological role in its native habitats and is also economically significant for its oil and timber."
