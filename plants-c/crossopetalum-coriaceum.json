    "intro": "Crossopetalum coriaceum, commonly known as the roughleaf crossopetalum, is a member of the Ericaceae family, characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers during the spring or early summer, which are borne on short, hairy pedicels. Its fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release minute seeds. This species is often found in rocky or well-drained soils in temperate regions, exhibiting a preference for acidic conditions."
