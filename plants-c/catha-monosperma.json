    "intro": "Catha monosperma, commonly known as khat, is a shrub native to the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and yellowish flowers. The plant is most notable for its stimulant properties, derived from the alkaloid cathinone found in its leaves. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. The plant's rapid growth and ability to regenerate after harvesting make it a resilient species in its native habitat."
