    "intro": "Centaurea solstitialis subsp. adami, commonly known as the yellow starthistle, is a perennial weed native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and spiny bracts, which help in seed dispersal. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and agricultural fields. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry conditions. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions of the United States."
