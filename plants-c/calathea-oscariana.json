It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that often display intricate patterns in shades of green, white, and pink. The plant's foliage is known to fold shut at night, a behavior that gives it its common name. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and high humidity to flourish. Calathea oscariana is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
