    "intro": "Cerasus pubescens, commonly known as the downy cherry, is a species of shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, or pubescent, leaves and stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries in summer. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. The downy cherry is valued for its ornamental appeal and its use in traditional Chinese medicine."
