    "intro": "Callitriche verna, commonly known as spring starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic herbaceous plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, star-shaped leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. Its flowers are tiny, usually white or pale blue, and appear in clusters near the water's surface. Callitriche verna is an early spring bloomer, often one of the first plants to emerge after winter, contributing to the ecological diversity of wetland environments."
