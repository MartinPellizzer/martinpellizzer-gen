    "intro": "Clematis umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow clematis, is a flowering vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, slightly hairy leaves and clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in woodland areas, preferring partial shade and moist, well-drained soil. Its climbing habit makes it suitable for trellises or arbors, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Clematis umbrosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
