    "intro": "Crataegus pascens, commonly known as the creeping hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pinkish flowers in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the autumn. Crataegus pascens is often found in open woodlands, hedgerows, and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
