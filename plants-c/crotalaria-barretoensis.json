It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It has a short stature, usually reaching up to 1 meter in height, and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and research settings."
