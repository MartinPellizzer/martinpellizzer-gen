    "intro": "Chaerophyllum meyeri, commonly known as Meyer's hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, compound leaves. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the carrot family. Its leaves are often hairy and have a strong, aromatic odor. Due to its resemblance to other toxic plants, it can be mistaken for harmful species, requiring caution when handling."
