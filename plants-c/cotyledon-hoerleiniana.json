    "intro": "Cotyledon hoerleiniana, commonly known as the Orange-leaf Cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically bright orange or red in color, especially when exposed to full sunlight. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine, although its primary ornamental value lies in its vibrant foliage."
