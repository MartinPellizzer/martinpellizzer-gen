    "intro": "Crocus biflorus var. tenorei, commonly known as the Tenore's crocus, is a rare and striking member of the Iridaceae family. It is native to the island of Sardinia, where it thrives in calcareous soils and rocky habitats. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to orange flowers with a distinctive, recurved petal shape. Its bulbs are small and rounded, adapted for survival in its native environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
