    "intro": "Cupressus sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves that are typically dark green. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Cupressus sinensis is also valued for its durable wood, which has been used in construction and furniture-making."
