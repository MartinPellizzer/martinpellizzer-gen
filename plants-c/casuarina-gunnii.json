    "intro": "Casuarina gunnii, commonly known as the coastal she-oak, is a hardy evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the stems. The plant produces small, red or yellowish flowers that are borne in compact clusters, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. Casuarina gunnii is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
