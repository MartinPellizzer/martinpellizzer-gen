It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features basal leaves that are typically grayish-green and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small, yellowish, and arranged in clusters. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Cousinia medorum is often used in alpine gardens for its hardiness and ornamental value."
