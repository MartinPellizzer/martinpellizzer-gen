    "intro": "Caladium regale, commonly known as the royal caladium, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that come in shades of pink, red, and white, creating a dramatic visual impact. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Caladium regale is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant foliage rather than its small, inconspicuous flowers. Its foliage remains the primary attraction, making it a popular choice for gardens and indoor spaces."
