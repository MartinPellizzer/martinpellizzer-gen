It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and tall, slender leaves that are often ribbed. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers, which are typically followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in wet, shaded environments, such as marshes and swamps, and is native to Southeast Asia. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and wetland restoration projects."
