    "intro": "Cheilosa montana, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in cooler climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Cheilosa montana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is appreciated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
