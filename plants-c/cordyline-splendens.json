    "intro": "Cordyline splendens, commonly known as the splendour cycad, is a striking plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and large, strap-like leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female flowers, typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in tropical and subtropical landscapes."
