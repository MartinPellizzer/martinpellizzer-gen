    "intro": "Cinchona krauseana, commonly known as the Krause's quinine tree, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant is notable for its medicinal properties, as it contains alkaloids similar to quinine, which have been historically used in the treatment of malaria. Its bark and leaves are harvested for their chemical compounds, making it an important species in both traditional and modern pharmacology. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Cinchona krauseana is considered vulnerable in some regions."
