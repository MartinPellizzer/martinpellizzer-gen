    "intro": "Clidemia coriacea, commonly known as roughleaf miconia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, shaded environments within lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its rough, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. Its flowers are small, clustered, and usually white or pale green, with showy bracts that attract pollinators. Clidemia coriacea is also known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some areas."
