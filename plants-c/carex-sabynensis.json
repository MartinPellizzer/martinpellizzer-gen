    "intro": "Carex sabynensis, commonly known as Sabyn's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. This species typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open areas such as grasslands and disturbed sites. Its foliage is grass-like, with narrow, linear leaves that are often green to bluish-green in color. Carex sabynensis produces small, clustered flower heads that are typically wind-pollinated, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
