    "intro": "Cousinia infundibularis, commonly known as the Kashmir bellflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its rosette-forming basal leaves and tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Cousinia infundibularis is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
