    "intro": "Cryptophoranthus gracilentus, commonly known as the slender ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves and small, pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to the wetlands of southeastern Brazil, this plant thrives in shaded, humid environments. It is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, often in association with specific host trees. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
