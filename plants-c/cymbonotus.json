    "intro": "Cymbonotus, commonly known as the flame violet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. They are characterized by their vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from red to purple, often with a striking contrast between the petals and the sepals. The leaves are typically ovate or elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Cymbonotus species are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses due to their attractive blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
