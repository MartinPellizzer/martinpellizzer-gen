    "intro": "Centranthus orbiculatus, commonly known as red valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features upright, branching stems that bear clusters of small, tubular, pink to red flowers. The plant has lance-shaped, aromatic leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant flower color and long blooming period, typically from late spring to early autumn."
