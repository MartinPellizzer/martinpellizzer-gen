    "intro": "Corysanthes carsei, commonly known as the Christmas orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the island of Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with a distinctive spurred lip. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the humid tropical rainforest environment. Its flowering season occurs during the wet season, usually between November and March. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
