    "intro": "Chrysopsis latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers and lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Chrysopsis latifolia is an important component of native plant communities and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
