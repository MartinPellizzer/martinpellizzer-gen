    "intro": "Ctenopteris trichosora, commonly known as the hairy sea palm, is a species of marine fern belonging to the family Ctenopteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, feather-like fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a unique appearance. This plant thrives in shallow, tropical coastal waters, often found in areas with moderate wave action. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Ctenopteris trichosora plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to biodiversity."
