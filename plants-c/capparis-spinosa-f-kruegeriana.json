    "intro": "Capparis spinosa f. kruegeriana, commonly known as the Krueger's flowering caper, is a rare and ornamental variant of the caper plant. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically smaller and more densely arranged compared to the standard species, giving it a more refined appearance. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established."
