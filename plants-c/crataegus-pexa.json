    "intro": "Crataegus pexa, commonly known as the rough crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to ovate leaves, and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The fruit, a small apple-like pome, matures to a red or yellow color and is edible but often tart. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for wildlife and supporting pollinators."
