It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its flowers are often pink or purple, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in its native range."
