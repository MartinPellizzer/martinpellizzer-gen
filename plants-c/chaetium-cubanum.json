    "intro": "Chaetium cubanum, commonly known as Cuban hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to Cuba and the West Indies. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth and slender, wiry leaves that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and wetland restoration projects."
