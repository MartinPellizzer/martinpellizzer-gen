It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows to a height of about 3 to 5 meters. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, clustered white flowers that are followed by orange-red berries. It is closely related to other cinchona species, which are known for their medicinal properties, particularly the production of quinine. This variety is less commonly cultivated than its relatives but is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical significance in traditional medicine."
