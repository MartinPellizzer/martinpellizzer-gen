    "intro": "Caesalpinia granadillo, commonly known as the granadillo tree, is a tropical legume native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers arranged in dense, racemose inflorescences, which are often showy and attract pollinators. Its fruit is a long, pod-like structure that splits open to release seeds. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine and as a source of timber."
