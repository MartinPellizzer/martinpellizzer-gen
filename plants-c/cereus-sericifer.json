    "intro": "Cereus sericifer, commonly known as the silky night bloomer, is a cactus native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white, silky hairs. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. The species is adapted to arid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
