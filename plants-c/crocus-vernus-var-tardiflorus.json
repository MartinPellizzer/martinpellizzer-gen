    "intro": "Crocus vernus var. tardiflorus, commonly known as the late-flowering crocus, is a variant of the common crocus native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its late blooming habit, typically flowering from late spring to early summer, which sets it apart from the typical early spring bloom of its parent species. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, often with a distinctive purple or brown stripe down the center. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from a corm, and it thrives in well-drained soil in full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its prolonged flowering period."
