    "intro": "Cipadessa depauperata, commonly known as the poor man's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments within forest undergrowth. The plant features a slender rhizome and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a faint fragrance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in lowland and montane areas. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
