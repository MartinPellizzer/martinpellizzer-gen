    "intro": "Corybas rivularis, commonly known as the streamlet corymb, is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant features a short, erect stem with a single, showy, hooded flower that is often greenish or reddish in color. Its unique floral structure consists of a spurred lip and a tightly closed ovary, which is characteristic of many corymb orchids. Corybas rivularis is known for its ability to thrive in humid, nutrient-rich soils, making it a common sight in temperate regions."
