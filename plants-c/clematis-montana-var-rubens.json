    "intro": "Clematis montana var. rubens, commonly known as the red montana clematis, is a vigorous climbing vine native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its most striking characteristic is its showy, red or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
