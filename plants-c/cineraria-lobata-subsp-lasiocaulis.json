    "intro": "Cineraria lobata subsp. lasiocaulis, commonly known as the woolly cineraria, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in spring. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense, woolly covering on the stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in coastal areas. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
