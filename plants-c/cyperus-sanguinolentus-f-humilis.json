    "intro": "Cyperus sanguinolentus f. humilis, commonly known as the pink flatsedge, is a low-growing perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale pink or reddish bracts, which give it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas or along waterways. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
