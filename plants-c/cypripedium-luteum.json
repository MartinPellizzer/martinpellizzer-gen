    "intro": "Cypripedium luteum, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow pouch-shaped flower, which is surrounded by a dark red or brown lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in coniferous or mixed forests. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the poor, acidic soils in which it thrives. Due to its beauty and rarity, it is highly sought after in horticulture and is protected in many regions."
