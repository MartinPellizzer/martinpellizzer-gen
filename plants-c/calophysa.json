    "intro": "Calophysa, commonly known as the wax plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers are typically showy, with vibrant colors and tubular shapes, attracting pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and the Americas, Calophysa species are often cultivated for their ornamental value. These plants thrive in well-drained soil and require moderate to bright light for optimal growth."
