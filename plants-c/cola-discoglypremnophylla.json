    "intro": "Cola discoglypremnophylla, commonly known as the African cola tree, is a member of the Sterculiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its large, simple leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers followed by hard, woody pods containing seeds. The seeds are often used in traditional medicine and as a stimulant due to their caffeine content. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth."
