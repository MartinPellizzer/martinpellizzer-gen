It features slender, cylindrical stems that often form dense clumps, and its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, clustered flower heads that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in wet or marshy environments, often found in swamps, ditches, and along waterways. Its botanical structure makes it well-adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
