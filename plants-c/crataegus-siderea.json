    "intro": "Crataegus siderea, commonly known as the Canadian hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated edges, and turn yellow in the fall. Crataegus siderea is often found in moist to wet habitats, such as riverbanks and swamps."
