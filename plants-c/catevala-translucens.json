    "intro": "Catevala translucens, commonly known as the translucent orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, waxy leaves that exhibit a unique translucency, allowing light to pass through them. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pale pink and white, which bloom during the early morning hours. Its root system is adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soils of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Catevala translucens is considered a vulnerable species."
