    "intro": "Campylotropis mortolana, commonly known as the Mortolana's climbing brier, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems that ascend along supports, often forming dense thickets. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated leaflets that provide a feathery appearance. Campylotropis mortolana is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
