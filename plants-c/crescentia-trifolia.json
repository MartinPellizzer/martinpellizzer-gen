    "intro": "Crescentia trifolia, commonly known as the \"Crescentia\" or \"Coco de Mer,\" is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a large, evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a broad, buttressed trunk and large, palmate leaves. The plant produces showy, white or yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by large, fibrous fruits containing a single, large seed. Its botanical features include a distinctive, heart-shaped leaf structure and a unique, curved seed pod. Crescentia trifolia is adapted to humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal and lowland areas."
