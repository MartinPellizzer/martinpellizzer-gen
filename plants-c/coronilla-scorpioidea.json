    "intro": "Coronilla scorpioidea, commonly known as the scorpion vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial legume characterized by its creeping growth habit and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, and it is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it can contribute to soil fertility in agricultural settings."
