    "intro": "Coniogramme fraxinea var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate ironwood, is a rare and hardy plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbels, which are typical of its family. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
