    "intro": "Corydalis alburyi, commonly known as the Albury's fumitory, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Corydalis alburyi thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its ornamental value is complemented by its role in supporting local insect populations."
