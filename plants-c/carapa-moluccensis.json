    "intro": "Carapa moluccensis, commonly known as the Moluccan nut or Moluccan blackwood, is a tropical tree native to Indonesia. It belongs to the Meliaceae family and is characterized by its dark, heavy wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, elongated fruits containing hard, angular seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland and hill forests. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species in its natural range."
