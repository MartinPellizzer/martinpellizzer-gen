    "intro": "Calceolaria fruticosa subsp. pamplonensis, commonly known as the Pamplona calceolaria, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces striking, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat. This subspecies is adapted to cool, moist environments and thrives in well-drained soils. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with cool, shady conditions."
