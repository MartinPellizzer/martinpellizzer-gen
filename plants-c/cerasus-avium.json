    "intro": "Cerasus avium, commonly known as the wild cherry or bird cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Prunus genus and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, dark red or black berries. Its bark is typically smooth and grayish-brown, with a tendency to peel in thin layers. Cerasus avium is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, and it plays an important role in supporting local wildlife."
