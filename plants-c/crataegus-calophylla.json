    "intro": "Crataegus calophylla, commonly known as the silky crataegus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely toothed leaves and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. Crataegus calophylla is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in gardens for its seasonal interest. It prefers well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
