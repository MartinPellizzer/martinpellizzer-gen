    "intro": "Chamaecrista caiapo, commonly known as the Brazilian burr legume, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a shrub that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by long, twisted pods containing seeds. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs. Chamaecrista caiapo is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
