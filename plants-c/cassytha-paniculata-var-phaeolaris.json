    "intro": "Cassytha paniculata var. phaeolaris, commonly known as the dark cassytha, is a vine species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground or climb other vegetation. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The dark cassytha is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands, where it thrives in humid conditions."
