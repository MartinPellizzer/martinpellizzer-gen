    "intro": "Carex holotricha, commonly known as the hairy sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in wetland areas. The flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with male and female flowers often found on separate spikelets."
