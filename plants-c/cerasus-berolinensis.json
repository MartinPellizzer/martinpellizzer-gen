    "intro": "Cerasus berolinensis, commonly known as the Berlin cherry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to central and eastern Europe, particularly Germany, where it was historically cultivated. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar to cherries but are often used for ornamental purposes rather than consumption. Its flowers are typically pink or white, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The Berlin cherry is valued for its aesthetic appeal and historical significance in botanical gardens."
