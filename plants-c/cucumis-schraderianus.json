It is a herbaceous vine that produces small, elongated fruits with a mild, slightly sweet flavor. The plant has hairy stems and broad, lobed leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. This species is valued for its edible fruit and is also studied for its potential in horticultural and genetic research."
