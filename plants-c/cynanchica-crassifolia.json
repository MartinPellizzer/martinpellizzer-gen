    "intro": "Cynanchica crassifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds and serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Cynanchica crassifolia is adapted to survive in harsh environments, making it a resilient species in dry climates."
