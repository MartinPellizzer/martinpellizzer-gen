    "intro": "Corallorhiza maculata subsp. mertensiana, commonly known as the spotted coralroot, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a myco-heterotroph. It relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrition, forming symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in rich, organic soil. It produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or red, with a distinctive spotted pattern on the petals. This subspecies is native to the eastern United States and is often found in association with hardwood forests."
