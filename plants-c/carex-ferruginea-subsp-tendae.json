    "intro": "Carex ferruginea subsp. tendae, commonly known as the rusty sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, such as those found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or brown at the base, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a spicate, cylindrical cluster of small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland environments."
