    "intro": "Carduus nutans subsp. platypus, commonly known as the broadleaf thistle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, woolly leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces purple to pink flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The subspecies platypus is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to other varieties of Carduus nutans."
