It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey-barked trunk and dark green, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its fruits are woody capsules that release seeds when mature, contributing to its role in local ecosystems. Chilocarpus costatus is adapted to the cool, humid climates of New Zealand's forests and is often found in coastal and lowland areas."
