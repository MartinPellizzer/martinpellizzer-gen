    "intro": "Chondrachyrum scabrum, commonly known as the rough sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, this plant is well adapted to dry environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are generally fleshy and covered in fine, rough textures, which help reduce water loss. The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
