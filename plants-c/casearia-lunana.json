It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom at night. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Due to its nocturnal blooming habit and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in warm climates."
