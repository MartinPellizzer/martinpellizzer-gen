    "intro": "Carex aquatilis subsp. epigejos, commonly known as the floating sedge, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, ribbon-shaped leaves that float just above the water surface. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in shallow water. This subspecies is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
