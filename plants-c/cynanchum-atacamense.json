    "intro": "Cynanchum atacamense, commonly known as the Atacama milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America, particularly the Atacama Desert. It is a member of the Asclepiadaceae family, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its milky sap, which can be toxic. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. It produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its adaptation to extreme desert conditions, it plays an important role in the local ecosystem."
