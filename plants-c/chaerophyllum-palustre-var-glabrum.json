    "intro": "Chaerophyllum palustre var. glabrum, commonly known as swamp cow parsley, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are usually hairless, giving it the \"glabrum\" designation. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Due to its preference for wet conditions, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity in aquatic environments."
