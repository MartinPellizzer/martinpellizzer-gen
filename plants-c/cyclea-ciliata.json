    "intro": "Cyclea ciliata, commonly known as the silky nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, often glabrous bark. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a soft, hairy texture, contributing to its common name. Cyclea ciliata is often found in moist, shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities and traditional medicinal uses."
