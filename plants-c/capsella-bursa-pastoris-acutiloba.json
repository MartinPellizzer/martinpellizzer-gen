It typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm, featuring alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster, followed by distinctive heart-shaped, hairy seed pods. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
