    "intro": "Castilleja flava var. rustica, commonly known as the yellow paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant features bright yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it often grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. The species is known for its striking appearance and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
