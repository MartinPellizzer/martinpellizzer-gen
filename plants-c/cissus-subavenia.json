    "intro": "Cissus subavenia, commonly known as the velvet leaf cissus, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its stems are succulent and can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread easily. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage."
