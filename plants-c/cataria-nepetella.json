    "intro": "Cataria nepetella, commonly known as catnip, is a flowering plant in the mint family (Lamiaceae). It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and it thrives in temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a serrated edge. Its small, pale blue or white flowers bloom in whorls along the stem. Catnip contains the essential oil nepetalactone, which is responsible for its stimulating effects on cats and its medicinal properties in humans."
