    "intro": "Chelonistele, commonly known as the \"spiny kumara,\" is a unique member of the Moraceae family, native to New Zealand. It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and distinctive, spiny leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, starchy tubers that resemble potatoes. Chelonistele thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological and agricultural study."
