    "intro": "Cerastium riaei subsp. subechinulatum, commonly known as the coastal chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically on slender stems. The leaves are usually oval or oblong, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in salty environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or rocky coastal areas. This subspecies is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient plant in harsh maritime conditions."
