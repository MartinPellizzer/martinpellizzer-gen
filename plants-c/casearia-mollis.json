    "intro": "Casearia mollis, commonly known as the velvetleaf casearia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often covered in fine, soft pubescence, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elliptic to ovate berries that turn red when mature. Casearia mollis is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value. Its foliage and fruits are also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
