    "intro": "Coleus baumii, commonly known as the Brazilian shield plant, is a tropical shrub native to Brazil. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native arid environment. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of its branches. Its succulent foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Coleus baumii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of care."
