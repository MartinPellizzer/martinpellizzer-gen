    "intro": "Commiphora pilosa var. venosa, commonly known as the hairy myrrh tree, is a variant of the Commiphora genus native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces a resinous sap that has been historically used in traditional medicine and incense. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a rough, textured surface. This variant is often distinguished by its unique leaf venation and overall morphology compared to other Commiphora species."
