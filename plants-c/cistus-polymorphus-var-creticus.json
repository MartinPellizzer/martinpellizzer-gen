    "intro": "Cistus polymorphus var. creticus, commonly known as the Cretan rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Greece. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and coastal environments. Its leaves are aromatic and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
