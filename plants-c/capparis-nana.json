    "intro": "Capparis nana, commonly known as the dwarf caper, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features succulent, dark green leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating called farina. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom in spring. Its fruit is a small, round capsule that contains several seeds. Capparis nana is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
