    "intro": "Carex leporina var. ovata, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh sedge, is a perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated, and its leaves are broad and flat, often with a waxy surface. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This species plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
