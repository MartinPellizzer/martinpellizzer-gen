    "intro": "Cochranea sclerocarpa, commonly known as the hard-shelled cochrania, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which are characteristic of the carrot family. Its leaves are pinnately divided and have a distinctive, slightly hairy texture. The fruit is a dry, two-lobed schizocarp that splits into two parts when mature, releasing small, winged seeds."
