It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and small, yellow-orange fruits that are typically harvested when fully mature. The plant thrives in warm, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its fruit is often used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent due to its aromatic properties. Citrus elongata is also valued for its ornamental appeal, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
