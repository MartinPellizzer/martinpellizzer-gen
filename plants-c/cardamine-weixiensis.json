    "intro": "Cardamine weixiensis, commonly known as the Weixian watercress, is a rare member of the Ranales order and the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to China, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor similar to other watercress species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant and potentially endangered species."
