    "intro": "Cristaria concinna, commonly known as the slender swamp snail, is a freshwater gastropod belonging to the family Helicarionidae. It is characterized by its small, delicate shell that is typically pale in color with a smooth, glossy surface. The snail is often found in still or slow-moving waters, such as marshes and ponds, where it feeds on algae and detritus. Its habitat is closely tied to aquatic vegetation, which provides both shelter and food sources. Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for water quality and ecosystem health."
