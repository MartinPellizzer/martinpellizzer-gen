    "intro": "Clethra minutistellata, commonly known as the dwarf sweet pepper, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, dark green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, round, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
