It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves and tall, sparsely branched stems. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are tubular in shape and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or gravelly habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
