    "intro": "Cypella ramosa, commonly known as the branched cypella, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its branched stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
