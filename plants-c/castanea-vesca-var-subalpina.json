    "intro": "Castanea vesca var. subalpina, commonly known as the alpine horse chestnut, is a rare variant of the horse chestnut tree. It is characterized by its smaller, spiny fruits and palmately lobed leaves that are typically shorter and broader than those of the standard species. This plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in mountainous regions of Europe. Its flowers are white and clustered in panicles, and it produces edible nuts enclosed in a prickly husk. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically rare species."
