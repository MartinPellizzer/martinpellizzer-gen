    "intro": "Colchicum polymorphum, commonly known as the meadow colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a bulbous corm, which serves as a storage organ for nutrients. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and often withering before flowering. Colchicum polymorphum is known for its medicinal properties, though it is toxic and should be handled with care."
