    "intro": "Cyperus hirtus, commonly known as hairy flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, such as marshes and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Cyperus hirtus is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
