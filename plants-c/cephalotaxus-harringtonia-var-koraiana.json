    "intro": "Cephalotaxus harringtonia var. koraiana, commonly known as the Korean yew, is a rare and ornamental conifer native to the Korean Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive, scale-like leaves that form a compact, spherical shape. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical conservation efforts."
