    "intro": "Cypripedium concolor var. tonkinense, commonly known as the Tonkin yellow lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a yellow lip and greenish-yellow sepals and petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich substrates. It has a pseudobulbous structure and produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
