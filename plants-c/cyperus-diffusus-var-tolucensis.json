    "intro": "Cyperus diffusus var. tolucensis, commonly known as the swamp spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the Americas. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow flowers. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize new areas. Cyperus diffusus var. tolucensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
