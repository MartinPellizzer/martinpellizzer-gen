    "intro": "Chrysocoma rigidula, commonly known as the rigid bushveld thornveld, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal umbels, followed by small, round fruits. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in dry conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local vegetation and a potential source of traditional medicine."
