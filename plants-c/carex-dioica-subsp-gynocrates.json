    "intro": "Carex dioica subsp. gynocrates, commonly known as the female sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctively dimorphic inflorescences, with female flowers typically found at the base and male flowers higher up on the spike. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it prefers moist, well-drained soils in wetlands or along streambanks. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates. The subspecies is notable for its sexual dimorphism, which is relatively rare in the Carex genus."
