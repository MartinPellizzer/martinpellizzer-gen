    "intro": "Croton aripoensis, commonly known as the Aripo croton, is a species of flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in Guyana and Venezuela. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its thick, rough, and often hairy stems. The leaves are typically alternate, simple, and ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsules containing numerous seeds. Croton aripoensis is often found in moist, tropical environments and is adapted to thrive in partial shade to full sun conditions."
