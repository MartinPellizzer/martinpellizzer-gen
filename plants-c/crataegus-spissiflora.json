    "intro": "Crataegus spissiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to ovate leaves, and clusters of white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed areas. Crataegus spissiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
