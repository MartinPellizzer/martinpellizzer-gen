    "intro": "Crataegus umbellata, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to ovate leaves, and showy clusters of white or pink flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus umbellata is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and rocky soils, and it is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological benefits."
