    "intro": "Chaetochloa penicillata, commonly known as the tufted hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in meadows, stream banks, or wetlands. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spikelet that bears small, spike-like flowers. Chaetochloa penicillata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
