    "intro": "Centaurea idaea, commonly known as the alpine star-thistle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and spiny foliage, which help it thrive in harsh alpine environments. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and high elevations, where it is adapted to cold temperatures and strong winds. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Centaurea idaea is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in herbal remedies."
