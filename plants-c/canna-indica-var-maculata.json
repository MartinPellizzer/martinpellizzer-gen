    "intro": "Canna indica var. maculata, commonly known as the spotted canna, is a striking ornamental plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, colorful leaves that often display distinctive red or purple markings, and its showy, spadix-like flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 5 feet, with a broad, upright habit that makes it suitable for both garden beds and containers. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained, fertile soil for optimal growth. Canna indica var. maculata is also known for its ability to tolerate moist conditions, making it a versatile choice for water gardens or boggy areas."
