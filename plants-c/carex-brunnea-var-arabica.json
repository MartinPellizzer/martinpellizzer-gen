    "intro": "Carex brunnea var. arabica, commonly known as the Arabian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It has a compact growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry landscapes. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
