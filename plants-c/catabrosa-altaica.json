    "intro": "Catabrosa altaica, commonly known as the Altai catabrosa, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheat and knotweeds. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Catabrosa altaica is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
