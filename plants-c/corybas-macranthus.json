    "intro": "Corybas macranthus, commonly known as the large-flowered hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped flowers that are typically deep purple or violet in color. The plant produces a single, showy flower per stem, which emerges from a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. The species is notable for its unique floral structure and is a subject of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological and evolutionary significance."
