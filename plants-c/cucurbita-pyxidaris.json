    "intro": "Cucurbita pyxidaris, commonly known as the sweet gourd or Turk's turban, is a species of flowering plant in the Cucurbitaceae family. It is native to the southeastern United States and is characterized by its distinctive, warty, and often ribbed fruit. The plant produces large, elongated leaves and yellow flowers, and its fruit can vary in color from green to orange or red. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes or as a vegetable, though its taste is generally milder compared to other cucurbits. The plant thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
