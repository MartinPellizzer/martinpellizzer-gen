It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that are often adorned with intricate patterns and contrasting veins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
