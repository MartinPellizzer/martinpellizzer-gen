It is characterized by its vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in conditions with seasonal dry spells. The species is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its showy blooms."
