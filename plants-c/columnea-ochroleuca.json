It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. This evergreen shrub is characterized by its striking, tubular, orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters. The leaves are typically elliptical and have a glossy, dark green surface with a yellowish underside. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
