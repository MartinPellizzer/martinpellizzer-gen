    "intro": "Cyperus strigosus var. stenolepis, commonly known as narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along water edges. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a cylindrical cluster, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to other Cyperus species, contributing to its unique botanical identity."
