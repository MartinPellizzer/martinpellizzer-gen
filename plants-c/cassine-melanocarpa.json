    "intro": "Cassine melanocarpa, commonly known as blackgum or maple-leaf elm, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. Cassine melanocarpa is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and ornamental contexts."
