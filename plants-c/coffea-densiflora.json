    "intro": "Coffea densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered coffee. It is a small evergreen shrub native to the highlands of Ethiopia and parts of Eritrea. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries containing the seeds used for coffee. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and have a waxy texture. While it is not widely cultivated for commercial coffee production, it holds significance in botanical studies and local ecosystems."
