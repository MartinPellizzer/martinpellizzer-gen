    "intro": "Coelococcus, commonly known as the orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often fragrant flowers and specialized structures such as the labellum and column. Coelococcus species are typically epiphytic, growing on trees in tropical and subtropical regions. They have pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and their roots are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air. The genus includes several species, some of which are prized for their ornamental value in horticulture."
