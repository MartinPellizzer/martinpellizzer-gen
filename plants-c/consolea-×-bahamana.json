It is native to the Caribbean and is characterized by its segmented, fleshy stems that resemble those of other cacti. The plant produces vibrant flowers in shades of red, pink, and white during the winter months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and festive blooming period, it is a popular ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions."
