    "intro": "Cheirorchis filiformis, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly found in regions of Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments within the understory of tropical forests. The plant features a delicate, filamentous stem and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
