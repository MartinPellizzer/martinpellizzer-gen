    "intro": "Clinanthus coccineus, commonly known as the scarlet sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking red or pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Clinanthus coccineus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
