    "intro": "Cuscuta flossdorfii var. microstyla, commonly known as the dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host plant. The plant is native to parts of Central America and is often found growing on grasses and other low-growing vegetation. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it can quickly colonize new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops if left unchecked."
