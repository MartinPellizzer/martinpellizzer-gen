    "intro": "Cymbopogon melanocarpus, commonly known as black grass or black oat grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce dark-colored seeds. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a fibrous texture that makes it suitable for use in thatching and basket weaving. Additionally, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
