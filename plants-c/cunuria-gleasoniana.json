    "intro": "Cunuria gleasoniana, commonly known as the Gleason's cunuria, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Cunoniaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats at high elevations. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited study, its population remains poorly understood."
