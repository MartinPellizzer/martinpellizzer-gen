    "intro": "Cestrinus, commonly known as the silverleaf cestrum, is a flowering plant belonging to the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is native to tropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with smooth, often silver- or grayish-green leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and they emit a strong, sweet scent, especially at night. Cestrinus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its visual and aromatic qualities."
