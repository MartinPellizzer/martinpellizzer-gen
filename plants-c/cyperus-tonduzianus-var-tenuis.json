    "intro": "Cyperus tonduzianus var. tenuis, commonly known as slender flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often submerged or floating. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in suitable moist environments. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
