    "intro": "Carex straminea f. tincta, commonly known as the golden sedge, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its golden hue comes from the color of its leaves, which can vary from yellow to reddish-brown depending on environmental conditions."
