It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
