    "intro": "Cassia \u00d7 floribunda var. scandens, commonly known as the Chinese flame tree, is a fast-growing, deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern China. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of bright yellow, flame-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its vibrant floral display. It prefers full sun and well-drained soil, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The seeds are encased in long, slender pods that turn from green to brown as they mature."
