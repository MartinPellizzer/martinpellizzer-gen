    "intro": "Carex longa, commonly known as longleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy areas in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Carex longa plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its ability to tolerate periodic flooding makes it a valuable plant in wetland restoration projects."
