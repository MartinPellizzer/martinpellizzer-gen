    "intro": "Caprifolium borbasianum, commonly known as the Borbasian honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically pink or white, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for ornamental gardening. The fruit, a small red berry, is edible but often used in traditional herbal remedies."
