    "intro": "Corydalis suaveolens, commonly known as sweet-scented corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to violet. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters and produces small, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. The flowers emit a subtle, sweet fragrance, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
