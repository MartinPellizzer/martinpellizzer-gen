    "intro": "Carex vulgaris f. densicarpa, commonly known as the dense-fruited sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, often thriving in moist, well-drained soils. It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams."
