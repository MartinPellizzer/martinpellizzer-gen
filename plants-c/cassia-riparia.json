    "intro": "Cassia riparia, commonly known as the Indian laburnum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and composed of several elliptical leaflets. The plant produces bright yellow, pendulous flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open to release the seeds. Cassia riparia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
