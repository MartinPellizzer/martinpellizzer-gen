    "intro": "Cactus lanifer, commonly known as the woolly cactus, is a unique species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly covering that helps protect it from intense sunlight and water loss. The plant has a short, thick stem with spines that provide additional defense against herbivores. Its flowers, which appear in spring, are typically yellow or orange and are adapted for pollination by nocturnal insects. Despite its harsh environment, the woolly cactus plays an important role in desert ecosystems by providing shelter and food for various wildlife."
