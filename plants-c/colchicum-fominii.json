    "intro": "Colchicum fominii, commonly known as the Fomin's autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caucasus region. It features striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous corm. Its flowers are typically borne on tall, upright stems and are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Colchicum fominii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also noted for its medicinal properties, though it contains toxic alkaloids."
