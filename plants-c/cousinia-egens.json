    "intro": "Cousinia egens, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows from 10 to 30 centimeters in height, with a compact, bushy appearance. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are small, yellowish to pinkish, and arranged in a dense cluster at the top of the stem. Cousinia egens is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots and a short growing season."
