    "intro": "Cyperus iria var. parviflorus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flatsedge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common aquatic or semi-aquatic species. The flowers are usually clustered in dense spikes, and the plant is often used in ornamental gardening due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal."
