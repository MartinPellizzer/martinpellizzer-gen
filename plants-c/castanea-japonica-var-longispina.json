    "intro": "Castanea japonica var. longispina, commonly known as the Japanese chestnut with long spines, is a variant of the Japanese chestnut native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, sharp spines on the husks of its nuts, which distinguish it from other chestnut varieties. The plant produces edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk that splits open when mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its nutritional value and ornamental appeal. The leaves are typically broad and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface."
