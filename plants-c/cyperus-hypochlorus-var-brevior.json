    "intro": "Cyperus hypochlorus var. brevior, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
