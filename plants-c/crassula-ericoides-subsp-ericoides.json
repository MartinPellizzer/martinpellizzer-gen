    "intro": "Crassula ericoides subsp. ericoides, commonly known as the African snowball, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact, rounded rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are densely packed and often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil with plenty of sunlight. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
