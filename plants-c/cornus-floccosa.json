    "intro": "Cornus floccosa, commonly known as the woolly dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its fluffy, white bracts that resemble clouds, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by red or orange berries. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a distinctive waxy coating, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Cornus floccosa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract wildlife."
