    "intro": "Claoxylon collenettei, commonly known as the Collenette's claoxylon, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its bark is smooth and often exhibits a reddish or brownish color, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals. Claoxylon collenettei is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its ornamental value and potential ecological significance in its native habitats."
