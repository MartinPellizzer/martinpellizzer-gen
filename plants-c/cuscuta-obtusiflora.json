    "intro": "Cuscuta obtusiflora, commonly known as the broad-leaved dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure that wraps around its host to extract water and nutrients. The plant is often found on a variety of herbaceous plants, including crops like beans and sunflowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through mechanical means, allowing it to spread widely. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
