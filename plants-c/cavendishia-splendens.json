    "intro": "Cavendishia splendens, commonly known as the Splendid Cavendish, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that range from red to orange and yellow, often resembling a flower but actually being modified leaves. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, anchoring itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its foliage is broad and sword-shaped, with a glossy surface that enhances its ornamental appeal. Cavendishia splendens thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
