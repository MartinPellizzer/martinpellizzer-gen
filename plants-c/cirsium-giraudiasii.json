    "intro": "Cirsium giraudiasii, commonly known as Giraud's thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern France. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, leafy stems and purple to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its foliage is covered in stiff, bristly hairs, which help protect it from herbivores and harsh weather conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Cirsium giraudiasii is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
