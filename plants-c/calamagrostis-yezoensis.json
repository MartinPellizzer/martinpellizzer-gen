    "intro": "Calamagrostis yezoensis, commonly known as Yezo reed, is a tall, clump-forming grass native to eastern Asia. It features narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically a deep green color, often with a bluish tint. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It is well adapted to wet or moist environments, such as marshes and riverbanks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes in temperate regions."
