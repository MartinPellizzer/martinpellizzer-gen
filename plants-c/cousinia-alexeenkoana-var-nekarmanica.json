    "intro": "Cousinia alexeenkoana var. nekarmanica, commonly known as the Nekarmanica cushion plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in its harsh, dry environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a valuable addition to xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
