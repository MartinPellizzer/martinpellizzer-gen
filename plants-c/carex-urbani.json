    "intro": "Carex urbani, commonly known as the urban sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in urban environments. It produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers in the summer, which are wind-pollinated. Carex urbani is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
