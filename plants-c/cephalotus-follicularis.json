    "intro": "Cephalotus follicularis, commonly known as the Albany carpet plant, is a unique carnivorous plant native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense mat, which helps in trapping small prey. The plant produces specialized structures called \"follicles\" that contain digestive enzymes to break down captured insects. Its leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures that enhance its ability to trap prey effectively. Cephalotus follicularis is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and relies on insect prey for essential nutrients."
