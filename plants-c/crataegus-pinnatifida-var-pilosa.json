    "intro": "Crataegus pinnatifida var. pilosa, commonly known as the Chinese hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its pinnately lobed leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are edible but often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and floral display. The variety pilosa is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, giving it a unique appearance compared to other hawthorn species."
