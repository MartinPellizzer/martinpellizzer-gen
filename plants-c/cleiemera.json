    "intro": "Cleiemera, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by spiny, leaf-like bracts. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to salty, windy environments. Cleiemera species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their distinctive appearance. They thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making them suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
