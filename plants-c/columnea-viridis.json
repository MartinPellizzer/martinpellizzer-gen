    "intro": "Columnea viridis, commonly known as the green columnea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant green leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Columnea viridis is popular among horticulturists for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
