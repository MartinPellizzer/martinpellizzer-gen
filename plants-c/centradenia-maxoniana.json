    "intro": "Centradenia maxoniana, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhamnaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in woodland and thicket habitats. The plant is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a timber resource. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Centradenia maxoniana is considered vulnerable and is protected in several regions."
