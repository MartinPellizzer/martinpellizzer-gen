    "intro": "Cleisostoma rugosulum, commonly known as the warty lip orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers with a distinctive warty texture on the lip, which is a key identifying characteristic. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air and decaying organic matter. Cleisostoma rugosulum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires careful cultivation to mimic its natural habitat."
