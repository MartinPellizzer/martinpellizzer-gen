    "intro": "Cuatrecasanthus flexipappus, commonly known as the flexible pappus plant, is a member of the Asteraceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters. Its unique feature is the presence of a flexible pappus, which aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories."
