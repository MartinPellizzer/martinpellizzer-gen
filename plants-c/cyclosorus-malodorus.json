    "intro": "Cyclosorus malodorus, commonly known as the stinking water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Onocophoraceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches, and is native to parts of Asia and Africa. Its distinctive odor, which resembles decay, is a key feature that aids in its identification. Cyclosorus malodorus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to nutrient cycling."
