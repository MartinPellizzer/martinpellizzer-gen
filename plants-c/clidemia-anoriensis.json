    "intro": "Clidemia anoriensis, commonly known as the white mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its attractive, showy white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests, often forming dense mats or shrubs. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are clustered in inflorescences. Clidemia anoriensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small organisms."
