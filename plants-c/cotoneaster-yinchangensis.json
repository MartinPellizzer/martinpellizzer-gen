    "intro": "Cotoneaster yinchangensis, commonly known as the Yinchang cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes. Cotoneaster yinchangensis is relatively low maintenance and thrives in well-drained soil."
