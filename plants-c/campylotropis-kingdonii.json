    "intro": "Campylotropis kingdonii, commonly known as the Kingdon's bottlebrush, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, red to purple flowers that resemble bottle brushes, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, hairy fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
