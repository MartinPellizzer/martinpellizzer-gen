    "intro": "Cinnamomum areolatocostae, commonly known as the mountain cinnamon, is a rare and lesser-known species of the Cinnamomum genus. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in parts of Vietnam and Laos. The plant is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. Its bark, like other cinnamon species, contains essential oils and has been traditionally used in herbal medicine. However, due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
