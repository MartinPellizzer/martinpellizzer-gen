    "intro": "Clematis vitalba subsp. gouriana, commonly known as the Gourian clematis, is a climbing vine native to parts of southern and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered in axillary racemes. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and along hedgerows. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
