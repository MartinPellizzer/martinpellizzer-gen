    "intro": "Calophyllum ellipticum, commonly known as the elliptic calophyllum, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their potential therapeutic properties. Calophyllum ellipticum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
