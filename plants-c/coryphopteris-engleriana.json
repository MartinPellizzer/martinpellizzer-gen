    "intro": "Coryphopteris engleriana, commonly known as the Engler's holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, evergreen fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive, almost holly-like appearance due to the sharp, serrated margins. Coryphopteris engleriana is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
