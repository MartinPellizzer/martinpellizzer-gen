    "intro": "Crataegus erythrocarpa, commonly known as the red-fruited hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to ovate leaves, and showy white or pink flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for various birds and mammals. Crataegus erythrocarpa is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed soils, and it has a long history of use in traditional medicine."
