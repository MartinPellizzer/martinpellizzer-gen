    "intro": "Cereus weingartianus, commonly known as the Weingarten night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and spiny, rib-like structure that helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers at night, which attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. Cereus weingartianus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and unique blooming habit."
