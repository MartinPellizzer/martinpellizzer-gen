    "intro": "Coelogyne imbricata, commonly known as the crested vanda, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, overlapping petals that give it a unique, almost feather-like appearance. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically during the dry season. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil and bright, indirect light. Coelogyne imbricata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
