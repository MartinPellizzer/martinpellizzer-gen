    "intro": "Camptostylus caudatus, commonly known as the evergreen huckleberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, which are elliptical and have a smooth or slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by edible berries that turn red in the fall. Its botanical characteristics include a woody stem with thorn-like projections and a preference for moist, acidic soils. Camptostylus caudatus is often found in wetlands and along streambanks, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
