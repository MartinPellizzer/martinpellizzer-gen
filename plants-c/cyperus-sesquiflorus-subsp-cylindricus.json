    "intro": "Cyperus sesquiflorus subsp. cylindricus, commonly known as the cylindrical flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that often form dense clumps, and its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with spikelets that are cylindrical in shape, giving it its subspecific name. The plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
