    "intro": "Cephalaria attenuata var. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf cephalaria, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of the Mediterranean. It features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers arranged in paniculate inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots are notable for their ability to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
