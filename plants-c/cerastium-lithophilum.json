    "intro": "Cerastium lithophilum, commonly known as the rock chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It features small, spoon-shaped leaves and produces clusters of white flowers with five petals. The plant is adapted to harsh conditions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss in arid environments. Cerastium lithophilum is often found in mountainous regions across Europe and parts of Asia."
