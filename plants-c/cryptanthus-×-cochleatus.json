    "intro": "Cryptanthus \u00d7 cochleatus, commonly known as the \"Rainbow Crisp\" or \"Coral Bells,\" is a hybrid plant belonging to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae. It is native to South America, specifically Brazil, and is valued for its vibrant, colorful foliage rather than its flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it an excellent choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes primarily from its striking, textured leaves that display a range of red, orange, and yellow hues."
