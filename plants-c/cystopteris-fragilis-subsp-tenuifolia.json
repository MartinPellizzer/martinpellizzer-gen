    "intro": "Cystopteris fragilis subsp. tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender fern, is a delicate fern species native to eastern North America. It features finely divided, slender fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sori on the underside of its leaves, which are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fragile, papery fronds give it a distinctive and ephemeral appearance."
