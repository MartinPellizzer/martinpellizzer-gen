    "intro": "Cardamine jamesonii proles pulcherrima, commonly known as the showy watercress, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small white or greenish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its rhizomes and leaves are often submerged or partially submerged in water, contributing to its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. The species is notable for its ornamental value and ecological role in supporting aquatic insect populations."
