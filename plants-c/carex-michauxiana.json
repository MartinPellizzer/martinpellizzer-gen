    "intro": "Carex michauxiana, commonly known as Michaux's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, bogs, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. Carex michauxiana is often found in shaded areas and plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils."
