    "intro": "Coffea mapiana, commonly known as the Java coffee or the mountain coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the highlands of Indonesia, particularly Java and Sumatra, where it thrives in cool, humid climates. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds used for coffee production. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves and compact growth habit, making it suitable for cultivation in shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Coffea mapiana is considered a rare and valuable species in the coffee world."
