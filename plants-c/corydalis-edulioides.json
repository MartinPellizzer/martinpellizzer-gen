    "intro": "Corydalis edulioides, commonly known as the edible corydalis, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Fumariaceae. It is native to regions of Asia, including China and the Himalayas, where it thrives in forested and rocky habitats. The plant features delicate, spurred flowers in shades of pink and purple, often arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, while the stems are usually slender and branching. Although some species of Corydalis are cultivated for their ornamental value, C. edulioides is notable for its potential culinary use, though caution is advised due to the presence of toxic alkaloids in some related species."
