    "intro": "Cotyledon parvula, commonly known as the dwarf cotyledon, is a small, succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green with red or purple edges, often covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. Cotyledon parvula is popular as a houseplant due to its compact size and striking appearance."
