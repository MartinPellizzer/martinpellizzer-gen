    "intro": "Castilleja latifolia var. rubra, commonly known as the redleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It features bright red bracts that resemble paintbrushes, which are actually modified leaves used to attract pollinators. The plant has a slender, erect stem and produces small, yellow flowers in clusters. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Due to its parasitic nature, it relies on the roots of other plants for nutrients."
