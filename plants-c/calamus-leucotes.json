    "intro": "Calamus leucotes, commonly known as sweet flag, is a perennial aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, rhizomatous growth habit and long, narrow leaves that often grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, typically emerging above the water surface. Its rhizomes are often harvested for their medicinal properties, containing compounds like volatile oils and alkaloids. Calamus leucotes plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
