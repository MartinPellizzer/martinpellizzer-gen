It is characterized by its dense clusters of tiny, scale-like leaves and small, cone-like structures that produce seeds. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in mountainous regions with cool, humid climates. Its foliage remains green year-round, providing habitat for various insects and birds. Cassiope lycopodioides plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
