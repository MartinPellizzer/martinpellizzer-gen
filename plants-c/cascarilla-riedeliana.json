    "intro": "Cascarilla riedeliana, commonly known as the yellow sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in countries like Mexico and Panama. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, yellowish wood that is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in lowland forests. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
