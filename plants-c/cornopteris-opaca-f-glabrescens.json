    "intro": "Cornopteris opaca f. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth frond fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed wood fern. It is characterized by its finely divided, glossy, and smooth-textured fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. This fern typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodland areas. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a delicate, feathery structure. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
