    "intro": "Cupaniopsis grisea, commonly known as the grey cupaniopsis, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, rounded foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, while its flowers are inconspicuous but followed by small, fleshy fruits. Cupaniopsis grisea is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to withstand salt spray."
