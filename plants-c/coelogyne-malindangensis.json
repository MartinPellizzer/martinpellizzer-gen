    "intro": "Coelogyne malindangensis, commonly known as the Mindanao orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the Philippines. It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb that supports its growth in nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often with a distinctive red or orange lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions for successful cultivation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered vulnerable to extinction."
