    "intro": "Cereus galapagensis, commonly known as the Gal\u00e1pagos torch cactus, is a species native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its tall, spiny stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a thick, water-storing stem that helps it survive in the arid conditions of its native habitat. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bats and moths, which are active during the evening. The cactus plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
