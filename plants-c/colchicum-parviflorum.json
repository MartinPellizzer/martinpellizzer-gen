    "intro": "Colchicum parviflorum, commonly known as the dwarf autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant features a short, stout rhizome and produces small, bell-shaped flowers on slender stems. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and often withering before flowering. Colchicum parviflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
