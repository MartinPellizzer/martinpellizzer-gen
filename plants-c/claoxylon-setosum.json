It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by woody, fleshy capsules containing seeds. It thrives in moist, lowland areas and is often found in secondary forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
