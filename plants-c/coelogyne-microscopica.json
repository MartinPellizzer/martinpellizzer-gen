    "intro": "Coelogyne microscopica, commonly known as the miniature coelogyne, is a rare orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant has a compact growth habit, with a pseudobulb that supports its foliage and flowering structure. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Coelogyne microscopica is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
