    "intro": "Cordia macrothyrsa, commonly known as the large-thyrsed cordia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are clustered in thyrses, which are dense, branched inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, often dispersed by wind. The plant is adapted to dry conditions and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
