    "intro": "Cakile maritima f. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf sea rocket, is a low-growing, annual plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts. It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with small, fleshy, lobed leaves that are adapted to salty, windy environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, round, edible pods. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along rocky shores. Its compact form and salt tolerance make it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems."
