    "intro": "Centaurium vulgare subsp. linariifolium, commonly known as the slender centaury, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, branching stems that often lie prostrate on the ground. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, giving it a grass-like appearance, and it thrives in moist, calcareous soils. It is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
