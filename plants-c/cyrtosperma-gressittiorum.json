    "intro": "Cyrtosperma gressittiorum, commonly known as the Gressitt's sago palm, is a species of cycad native to New Guinea. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, spherical cones that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
