    "intro": "Cytisus gallicus, commonly known as the French broom, is a flowering shrub native to western Europe. It features narrow, leathery leaves and produces bright yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. The plant is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and open woodlands. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
