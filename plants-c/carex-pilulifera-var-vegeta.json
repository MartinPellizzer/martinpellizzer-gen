    "intro": "Carex pilulifera var. vegeta, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled, brownish seed capsules. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
