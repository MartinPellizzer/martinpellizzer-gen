It features thorny branches and produces clusters of white or pink flowers in the spring, followed by red berries in the fall. The plant has small, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and it is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. The Colorado hawthorn is also valued for its role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and small mammals."
