    "intro": "Cynorkis pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to certain regions of Africa. It is a terrestrial herb with a short, creeping rhizome and produces few, small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its flowers are usually arranged in a loose spike and are characterized by their narrow, lance-shaped petals. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
