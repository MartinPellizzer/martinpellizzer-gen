    "intro": "Clematis lanuginosa var. nivea, commonly known as the white-flowered clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It features soft, grayish-white stems covered in a dense layer of silky, lanugo-like hairs, giving it its species name. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of white to pale blue. Its foliage is compound, with small, ovate leaves that are usually green and slightly hairy. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance and vigorous growth."
