    "intro": "Carapichea vasivensis, commonly known as the pink-flowered sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Carapichea vasivensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in coastal gardens."
