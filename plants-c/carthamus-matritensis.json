    "intro": "Carthamus matritensis, commonly known as the Spanish saffron or Matritense saffron, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly Spain. It is characterized by its striking orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a distinctive, aromatic yellow-orange stigma, which is harvested and used as a spice, similar to true saffron. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in Mediterranean climates. Its botanical name reflects its historical significance and geographic origin."
