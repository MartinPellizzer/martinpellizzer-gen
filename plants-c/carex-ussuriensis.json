    "intro": "Carex ussuriensis, commonly known as the Ussuri sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and forest understories. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. Carex ussuriensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
