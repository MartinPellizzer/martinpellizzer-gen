    "intro": "Cotoneaster sandakphuensis, commonly known as the Sandakphu cotoneaster, is a species of shrub native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, typically between 2,000 and 3,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
