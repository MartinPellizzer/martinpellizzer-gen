    "intro": "Crataegus floridana, commonly known as the Florida hawthorn, is a small deciduous shrub or tree native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 15 feet and features thorned branches, which are a distinctive botanical feature. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptical in shape, with serrated edges, and they turn yellow in autumn. Crataegus floridana is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils."
