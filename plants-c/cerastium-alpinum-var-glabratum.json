    "intro": "Cerastium alpinum var. glabratum, commonly known as the glabrous alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, though the varietal name \"glabratum\" suggests a reduced hair coverage compared to the typical form. Its flowers are white or pink, with five petals, and bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous environments where it contributes to the alpine flora."
