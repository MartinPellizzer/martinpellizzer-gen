It is characterized by its finely textured, silvery-gray leaves that are small and opposite, giving it a delicate, mist-like appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for hedges and garden landscapes. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
