    "intro": "Costantina, commonly known as the Christmas bell, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits known as cypsela, which are dispersed by wind. Costantina thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period, which typically spans from autumn to spring."
