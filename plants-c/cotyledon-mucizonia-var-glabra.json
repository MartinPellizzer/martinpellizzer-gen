    "intro": "Cotyledon mucizonia var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces striking pink or purple flowers during the warmer months, adding visual interest to its appearance. It is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in well-draining soil and full sunlight. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
