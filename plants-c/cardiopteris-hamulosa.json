    "intro": "Cardiopteris hamulosa, commonly known as the Japanese holly fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy layer, which helps in moisture retention. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in distinctive patterns."
