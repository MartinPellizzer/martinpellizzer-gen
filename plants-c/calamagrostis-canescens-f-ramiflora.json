    "intro": "Calamagrostis canescens f. ramiflora, commonly known as the silver bluestem grass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and slender, branching stems that give it a distinctive appearance. This variety is often found in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a soft, fuzzy texture that contributes to its ornamental value. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle floral display to the landscape."
