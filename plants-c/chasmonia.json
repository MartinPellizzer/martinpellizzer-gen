    "intro": "Chasmonia, commonly known as the \"blue poppies,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Papaveraceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often blue or purple, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Chasmonia species are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and Mexico. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are adapted to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to their ecological significance in their native habitats."
