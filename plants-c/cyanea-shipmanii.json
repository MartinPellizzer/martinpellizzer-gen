    "intro": "Cyanea shipmanii, commonly known as the Shipman\u2019s hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of Hawaii. Cyanea shipmanii is a shrub that can reach heights of up to 3 meters, with thick, waxy leaves that help conserve moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
