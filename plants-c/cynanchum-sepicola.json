    "intro": "Cynanchum sepicola, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap, which is typical of the genus Cynanchum. Its leaves are opposite and narrow, often with a hairy texture, and it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Cynanchum sepicola plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in steppe and grassland ecosystems."
