    "intro": "Carex spathaceobracteata, commonly known as the broad-bract sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces spikelets that are often subtended by broad, leaf-like bracts. This plant is typically found in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It has narrow, linear leaves that are usually arranged in three rows, a common feature among sedges. The flowers are small and clustered, with the female flowers typically positioned below the male flowers in the inflorescence."
