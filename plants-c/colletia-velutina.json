    "intro": "Colletia velutina, commonly known as the velvet candelabra cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly found in regions of Argentina and Bolivia. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to gray hairs, which gives it a velvety appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, adding ornamental value. Its stems are often branched and can grow quite tall, sometimes reaching heights of up to three meters. Colletia velutina is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
