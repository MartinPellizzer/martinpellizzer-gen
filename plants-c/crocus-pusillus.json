    "intro": "Crocus pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf crocus, is a small, perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows to a height of only 2\u20135 inches, featuring delicate, nodding flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or white. The plant produces its flowers in early spring, often before the leaves emerge, and the blooms are followed by narrow, grass-like leaves. Its bulbs are adapted to rocky or sandy soils, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Crocus pusillus is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a border plant."
