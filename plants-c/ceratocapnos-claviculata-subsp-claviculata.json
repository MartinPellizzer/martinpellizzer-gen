    "intro": "Ceratocapnos claviculata subsp. claviculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender stems and bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators in high-altitude ecosystems."
