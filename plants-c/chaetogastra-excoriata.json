    "intro": "Chaetogastra excoriata, commonly known as the scaly sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a layer of white, waxy crystals, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of yellow to green, typically blooming in spring. Its root system is extensive and adapted for nutrient absorption in poor, sandy soils. Chaetogastra excoriata is often found in rocky outcrops and along the edges of dry riverbeds."
