    "intro": "Cyanotis brunnea, commonly known as the bluebell orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, often with a waxy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Cyanotis brunnea is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
