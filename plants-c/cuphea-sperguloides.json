It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to pink. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that help it retain moisture in its native arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Cuphea sperguloides is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees."
