    "intro": "Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus subsp. pumilus, commonly known as the stickyflower goosefoot, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and small, yellowish-green leaves covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by small, rounded fruits. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as sagebrush steppe. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments and contribute to its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
