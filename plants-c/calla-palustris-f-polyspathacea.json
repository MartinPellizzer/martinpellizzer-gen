    "intro": "Calla palustris f. polyspathacea, commonly known as the marsh calla or swamp arum, is a striking aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features a distinctive spathe, a large, showy leaf-like structure that encloses the small, spadix-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, with its roots often submerged. Its leaves are broad and arrow-shaped, often floating on the water surface. This variant is notable for its unique floral morphology and its role in wetland ecosystems."
