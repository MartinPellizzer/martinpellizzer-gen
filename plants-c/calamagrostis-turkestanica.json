It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, riverbanks, and lake shores. The plant has tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often silver-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-based flowers. Calamagrostis turkestanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing wetland soils."
