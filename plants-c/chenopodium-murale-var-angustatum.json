    "intro": "Chenopodium murale var. angustatum, commonly known as narrowleaf goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is a low-growing annual herb with succulent, often hairy stems and alternate leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in dry fields, roadsides, and wastelands. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in some agricultural areas."
