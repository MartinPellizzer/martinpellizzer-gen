    "intro": "Ceratopteris thalictroides subsp. thalictroides, commonly known as the tropical water fern, is a member of the fern family. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often used in aquatic environments. This species is native to tropical regions of the Americas and thrives in moist, shady habitats. The plant's rhizomes are typically submerged, allowing it to spread through fragmentation. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to purify water in ponds and aquariums."
