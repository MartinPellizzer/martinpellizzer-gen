    "intro": "Carduus undulatus var. nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada thistle, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and large, blue to purple composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, such as mountain slopes and open woodlands. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The Sierra Nevada thistle plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range."
