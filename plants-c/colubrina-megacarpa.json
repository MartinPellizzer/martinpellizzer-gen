    "intro": "Colubrina megacarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by showy, violet to purple berries in the fall. These berries are notable for their size and vivid color, making them a striking feature of the plant. Colubrina megacarpa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
