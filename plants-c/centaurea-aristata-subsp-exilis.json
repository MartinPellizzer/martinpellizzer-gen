It typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open fields. The plant features spiny leaves and bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer. It has a compact growth habit with a basal rosette of leaves and a flowering stem that rises above them. The subspecies exilis is distinguished by its smaller size and more slender stems compared to the typical form of Centaurea aristata."
