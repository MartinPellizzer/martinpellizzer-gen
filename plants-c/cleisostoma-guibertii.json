    "intro": "Cleisostoma guibertii, commonly known as the Guibert's cleistostoma, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a loose inflorescence. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are ovate and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support and reducing water loss. Cleisostoma guibertii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
