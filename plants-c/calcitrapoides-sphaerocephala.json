    "intro": "Calcitrapoides sphaerocephala, commonly known as the globe-headed calcitrap, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its spherical, inflated head, which is composed of tightly packed bracts that form a distinctive, lantern-like structure. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, thriving in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to its specialized morphology and habitat, it is often found in specific regions of southern Africa."
