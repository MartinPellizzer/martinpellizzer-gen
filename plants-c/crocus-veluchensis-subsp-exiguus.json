    "intro": "Crocus veluchensis subsp. exiguus, commonly known as the small-cormed crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, early spring blooms in shades of white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 centimeters and is characterized by its small, compact corms. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
