    "intro": "Cypripedium macranthos var. speciosum, commonly known as the showy lady's tresses, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and dense clusters of pale pink to white flowers that resemble a cascade of tiny bells. The plant has elliptical, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in two rows along the stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its beauty and rarity, it is highly valued in horticulture but is also threatened by habitat loss and over-collection."
