    "intro": "Coccinia decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive cucumber, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other gourds and cucurbits. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by green, pear-shaped fruits. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered with fine hairs. The fruit is often mistaken for a real cucumber due to its appearance, hence the common name."
