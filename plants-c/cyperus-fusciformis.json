It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically found in dense clusters at the tips of the stems.

Its adaptability to humid conditions makes it a common component of wetland ecosystems."
