    "intro": "Chlorospatha yaupiensis, commonly known as the Yaupi golden fern, is a unique plant species native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial ferns. The plant is characterized by its bright green, leathery fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. Its growth habit is typically low to the ground, with rhizomes that help it anchor to the forest floor or tree trunks. Due to its restricted habitat and limited study, Chlorospatha yaupiensis remains a relatively obscure but ecologically significant species."
