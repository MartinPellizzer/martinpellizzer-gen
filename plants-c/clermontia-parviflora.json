    "intro": "Clermontia parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf clermontia, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Clermontia parviflora is considered a rare and endangered species."
