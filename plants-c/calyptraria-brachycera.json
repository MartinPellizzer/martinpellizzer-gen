    "intro": "Calyptraria brachycera, commonly known as the short-horned calyptra, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Caloplacaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, flat thallus with a granular surface and a yellowish to orange coloration. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide photosynthetic capabilities, while the fungal component offers structural support and protection. It typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in moist, shaded environments. Calyptraria brachycera is often found in temperate regions and is used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
