It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in coastal or heathland environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are usually pink or red, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. This subspecies is part of the Proteaceae family, which is known for its diverse and often ornamental flowering plants."
