    "intro": "Cyperus amuricus var. subivioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, scale-like flowers. Native to wetland environments in eastern Asia, this plant thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
