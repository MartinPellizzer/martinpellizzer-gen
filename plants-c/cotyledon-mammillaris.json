    "intro": "Cotyledon mammillaris, commonly known as the wrinkled cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating called farina. The plant produces striking, vibrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
