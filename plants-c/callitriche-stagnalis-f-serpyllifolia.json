    "intro": "Callitriche stagnalis f. serpyllifolia, commonly known as the common water starwort, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the Hydrocharitaceae family. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has small, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually submerged or floating, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich waters, and it plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing excess nutrients."
