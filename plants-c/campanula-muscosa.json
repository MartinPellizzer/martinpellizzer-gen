    "intro": "Campanula muscosa, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Campanula muscosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, bell-like blooms."
