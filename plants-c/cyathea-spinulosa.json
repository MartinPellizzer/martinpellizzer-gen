    "intro": "Cyathea spinulosa, commonly known as the spinulose tree fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Cyatheaceae. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in structures called sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Cyathea spinulosa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be cultivated in warm climates with proper care."
