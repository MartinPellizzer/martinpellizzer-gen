    "intro": "Crataegus fallens, commonly known as the falling crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 12 feet and features thorny branches with opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, showy flowers in the spring, followed by red or yellow fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant seasonal changes and compact size, making it suitable for small gardens. The species is also valued for its role in supporting local wildlife and its historical use in traditional medicine."
