It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being ovate and hairy. The plant produces racemose inflorescences, bearing small, yellowish-white flowers that are attractive to pollinators. Its seeds are typically small and can be used for forage or as a green manure in agricultural systems. The plant is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
