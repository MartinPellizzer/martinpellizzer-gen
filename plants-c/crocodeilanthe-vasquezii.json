    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe vasquezii, commonly known as the V\u00e1squez's cryptostele, is a rare and enigmatic fern native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant exhibits a unique cryptostele structure, which is a specialized vascular arrangement found in certain primitive ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered and is often found growing on mossy tree trunks or shaded rock surfaces. Its conservation status highlights the fragility of tropical rainforest ecosystems."
