    "intro": "Calamintha nepeta var. hirsutissima, commonly known as hairy catmint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features aromatic, gray-green leaves covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant choice for gardens. Its fragrant foliage and showy flowers make it a valuable addition to pollinator-friendly landscapes."
