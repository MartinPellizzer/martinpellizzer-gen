    "intro": "Cephaloceraton histrix, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are capsules that split open to release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Cephaloceraton histrix is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
