It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its dense, woody growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, woody fruits that mature in the fall. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to the harsh, coastal climate with frequent salt spray and strong winds. Coreocarpus congregatus is an important plant for local wildlife, providing food and shelter for various insects and birds."
