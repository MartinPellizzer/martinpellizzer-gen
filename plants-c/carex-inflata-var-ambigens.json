    "intro": "Carex inflata var. ambigens, commonly known as the variable sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, strap-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flower spikes that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
