    "intro": "Calamagrostis porteri subsp. insperata, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada reed, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, fluffy flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a light, airy appearance to its overall structure. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian habitats and wet meadows. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in its range."
