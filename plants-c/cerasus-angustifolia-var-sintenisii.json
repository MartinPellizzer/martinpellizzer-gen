It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, sweet, edible fruits that are often used in jams and desserts. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens and landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its spring blossoms and autumn foliage."
