It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that resemble pine needles. The plant produces bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and woodland settings. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated for horticultural and traditional uses."
