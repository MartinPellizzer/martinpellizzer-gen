    "intro": "Cirsium bulbosum subsp. anglicum, commonly known as the English thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. It has a deep taproot system, which helps it survive in various environmental conditions. The subspecies anglicum is distinguished by its more robust growth and slightly different leaf morphology compared to other subspecies of Cirsium bulbosum."
