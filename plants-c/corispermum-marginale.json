    "intro": "Corispermum marginale, commonly known as the coastal bladderwrack, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Its seeds are encased in a membranous fruit, and it is often found in coastal areas where it tolerates high salinity and exposure to wind. Corispermum marginale plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
