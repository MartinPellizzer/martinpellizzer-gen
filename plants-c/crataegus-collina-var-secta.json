    "intro": "Crataegus collina var. secta, commonly known as the narrowleaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often sparsely branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters, followed by red or orange berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
