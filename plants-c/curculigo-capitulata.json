    "intro": "Curculigo capitulata, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its unique, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or golden in color. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Its leaves are strap-like and often have a waxy coating, which helps in reducing water loss in its natural habitat. Curculigo capitulata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
