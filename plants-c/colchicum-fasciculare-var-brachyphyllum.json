    "intro": "Colchicum fasciculare var. brachyphyllum, commonly known as the short-stemmed autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves that are basal and often covered in a fine, silky hair. It produces distinctive, helmet-shaped corms that store nutrients for the next growing season. This variety is particularly valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
