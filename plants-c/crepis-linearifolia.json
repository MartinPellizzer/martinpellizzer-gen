    "intro": "Crepis linearifolia, commonly known as the slender rough-hair grass, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas, thriving in temperate climates. Its linear, hairy leaves and small, yellowish flower heads are adaptations to its arid environment. Crepis linearifolia is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
