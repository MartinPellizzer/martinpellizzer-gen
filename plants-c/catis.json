    "intro": "Catis, commonly known as the cat's ear plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-shaped flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. The plant features hairy, lobed leaves that resemble a cat's ear, giving it its common name. Its small white or yellow flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Catis is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and can also be grown as a medicinal herb."
