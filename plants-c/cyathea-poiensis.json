    "intro": "Cyathea poiensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, trunk-like stem and large, feather-like fronds. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and is typically found in moist, shaded areas of the forest. Its fronds can grow up to several meters in length, contributing to the dense canopy of the understory. Cyathea poiensis plays an important ecological role in Hawaiian ecosystems, providing habitat and shelter for various native species."
