    "intro": "Cordia mollis, commonly known as the velvetleaf or sweetleaf tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in pendulous inflorescences, followed by orange to red fruits that contain several seeds. Its roots are known to exude a sticky substance, which can form a natural gum used in traditional medicine and industry. The plant is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it an important species in reforestation efforts."
