    "intro": "Coronilla stipulata, commonly known as the slender crownvetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with stipules. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or violet, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils and making it a useful plant for erosion control. Coronilla stipulata is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
