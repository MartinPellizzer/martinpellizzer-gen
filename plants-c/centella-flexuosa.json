    "intro": "Centella flexuosa, commonly known as creeping centella, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant has a sprawling growth habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread extensively. Its leaves are heart-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. Centella flexuosa is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional medicine for its potential healing benefits."
