    "intro": "Cynoglossum gansuense, commonly known as the Gansu mouse-ear, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Gansu, China. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine meadows at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
