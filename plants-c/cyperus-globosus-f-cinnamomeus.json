    "intro": "Cyperus globosus f. cinnamomeus, commonly known as the cinnamon rush, is a variant of the common spike rush. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features slender, grass-like stems that often grow in dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow and slightly curved, and it produces small, cylindrical spikes of flowers. The cinnamon-scented foliage gives it its distinctive name and adds to its ornamental value in wetland gardens."
