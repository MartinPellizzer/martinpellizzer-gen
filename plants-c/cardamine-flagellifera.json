    "intro": "Cardamine flagellifera, commonly known as the slender water crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks, wet meadows, and woodland floors. The plant features a basal rosette of pinnately lobed leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are arranged in a dense, terminal cluster and bloom in early spring. Cardamine flagellifera is characterized by its delicate appearance and its role in aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
