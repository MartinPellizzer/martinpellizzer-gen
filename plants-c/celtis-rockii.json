    "intro": "Celtis rockii, commonly known as the Chinese hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to China. It belongs to the Cannabaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by spherical, red berries that ripen in the fall. Celtis rockii is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in urban environments due to its tolerance of pollution and compacted soils. Its ornamental value and resilience make it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate regions."
