    "intro": "Campanula polymorpha var. praticola, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically basal, forming a rosette and are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine environment. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings due to its drought tolerance and cold hardiness. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile choice for gardeners seeking a resilient, ornamental plant."
