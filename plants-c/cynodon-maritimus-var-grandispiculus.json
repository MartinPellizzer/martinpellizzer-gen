    "intro": "Cynodon maritimus var. grandispiculus, commonly known as the coastal grass or beach grass, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which are typically pink to purple in color. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and wind. This variety is often used for erosion control in coastal environments due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize dunes."
