    "intro": "Cannabis indica, commonly known as Indian hemp, is a species of the cannabis plant native to the Hindu Kush mountain region. It is characterized by its broad, serrated leaves and relatively short, stocky stature compared to other cannabis varieties. The plant typically flowers indoors within 8 to 10 weeks, producing dense, resinous buds that are rich in cannabinoids like THC and CBD. Cannabis indica is often associated with sedative and relaxing effects due to its high concentration of certain compounds. Its botanical features make it a significant plant in both medicinal and recreational contexts."
