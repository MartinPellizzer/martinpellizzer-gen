    "intro": "Callitriche longipedunculata, commonly known as the long-stemmed water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. Its flowers are tiny, white or pale blue, and are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish."
