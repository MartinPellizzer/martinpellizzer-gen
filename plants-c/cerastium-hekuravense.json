    "intro": "Cerastium hekuravense, commonly known as the Himalayan mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate habit and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover in cooler climates."
