    "intro": "Cyathiscus montanus, commonly known as the mountain cyathiscus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, a feature typical of the genus. Cyathiscus montanus is often found in alpine meadows and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations."
