    "intro": "Cyperus olidus, commonly known as sweetflag, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland areas in the Americas. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are often green or reddish in color. The plant thrives in moist or aquatic environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine, and it is also used as a source of natural dyes. Cyperus olidus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
