    "intro": "Cotoneaster nitidus var. parvifolius, commonly known as the dwarf cotoneaster, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, providing dense foliage throughout the year. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring, which are followed by red berries that persist into winter. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a foundation plant due to its hardy nature and low maintenance requirements. Its ornamental value lies in its foliage, floral display, and seasonal fruiting."
