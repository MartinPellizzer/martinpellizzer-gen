    "intro": "Crepidifolium, commonly known as the basket fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its unique, fern-like fronds that resemble a basket. The plant has a rhizomatous structure, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically compound, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in humid environments. Crepidifolium is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying properties."
