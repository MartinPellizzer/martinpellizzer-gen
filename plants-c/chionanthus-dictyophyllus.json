It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly foliage that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle floral scent to its environment.

Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
