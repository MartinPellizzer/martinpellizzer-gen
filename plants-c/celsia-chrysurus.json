It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in countries like Mexico and Guatemala. The plant is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. Celsia chrysurus prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings."
