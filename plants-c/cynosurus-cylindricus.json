    "intro": "Cynosurus cylindricus, commonly known as the cylindrical bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Cynosurus cylindricus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
