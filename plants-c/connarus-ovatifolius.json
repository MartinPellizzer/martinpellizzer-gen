    "intro": "Connarus ovatifolius, commonly known as the oval-leaf connarus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. It produces small, white to yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by various pollinators. The fruit is a capsule that dehisces to release its seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the natural habitat."
