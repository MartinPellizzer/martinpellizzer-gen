    "intro": "Convolvulus arvensis var. minutus, commonly known as the dwarf field bindweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is a low-growing annual or biennial herb characterized by its small, pale yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in cultivated areas."
