It is native to South America and thrives in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has pinnately compound leaves that fold inward and droop when disturbed, a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its flowers are small, pink to purple, and clustered in spherical inflorescences. The species is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its unique behavior and adaptability to various soil types."
