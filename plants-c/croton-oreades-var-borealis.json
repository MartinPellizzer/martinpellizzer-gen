    "intro": "Croton oreades var. borealis, commonly known as the alpine croton, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
