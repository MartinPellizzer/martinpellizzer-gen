    "intro": "Cardamine foliosa, commonly known as the broadleaf watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, often hairy leaves that are slightly succulent. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically borne on slender stems. Its reproductive strategy involves self-pollination, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. Cardamine foliosa is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
