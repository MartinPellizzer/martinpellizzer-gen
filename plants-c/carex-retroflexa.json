    "intro": "Carex retroflexa, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and pond edges. Carex retroflexa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
