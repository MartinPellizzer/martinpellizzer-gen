It is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds. Cestrum bracteatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
