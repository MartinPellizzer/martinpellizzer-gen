    "intro": "Carex davalliana subsp. cyrnea, commonly known as the silver-haired sedge, is a perennial plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that ranges from silver to gray-green in color. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically pollinated by wind. This subspecies is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife."
