    "intro": "Cardamine hirsuta var. tenuifolia, commonly known as slender hairy buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a basal rosette of finely divided, hirsute (hairy) leaves, which are often described as delicate and fern-like. Its flowers are yellow and consist of two sepals and two petals, forming a distinctive cup-shaped structure. The species is characterized by its small stature and preference for cool, humid conditions."
