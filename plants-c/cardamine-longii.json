    "intro": "Cardamine longii, commonly known as the longleaf watercress, is a delicate perennial herb native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its small white flowers bloom in early spring, followed by elongated pods that contain several seeds. Botanically, it is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and its preference for cool, humid climates."
