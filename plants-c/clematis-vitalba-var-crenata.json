    "intro": "Clematis vitalba var. crenata, commonly known as the creeping clematis, is a vigorous climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, often with a slightly notched or wavy edge. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed carefully."
