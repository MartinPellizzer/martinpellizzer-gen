    "intro": "Claytonia perfoliata var. nubigena, commonly known as the alpine pink or mountain pink, is a perennial herb native to the high elevations of the western United States. It is characterized by its rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine white coating. The plant produces clusters of showy pink or magenta flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically arranged in a perfoliate pattern, where the stem passes through the center of the leaf, giving it a unique appearance. This variety is adapted to cold, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
