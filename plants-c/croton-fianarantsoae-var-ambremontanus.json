    "intro": "Croton fianarantsoae var. ambremontanus, commonly known as the Ambremont's croton, is a rare and endemic species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves with a striking combination of green, yellow, and red hues. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
