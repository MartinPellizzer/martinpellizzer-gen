    "intro": "Corylus colurna var. lacera, commonly known as the Turkish hazel, is a variant of the common hazel native to Turkey and parts of the Balkans. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its slender, branching structure and palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces catkin-like male flowers and female flowers in separate clusters, typical of the hazel genus. Its nuts are edible, though often encased in a thick, spiky husk. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native habitats."
