    "intro": "Capsella lingulata, commonly known as the narrowleaf weed or narrowleaf chickweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing annual plant with opposite, narrow leaves and small white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called achenes, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, gardens, and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
