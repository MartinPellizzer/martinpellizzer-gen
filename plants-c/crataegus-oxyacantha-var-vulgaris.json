    "intro": "Crataegus oxyacantha var. vulgaris, commonly known as hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. The hawthorn is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine."
