    "intro": "Chamaefilix cirrhata, commonly known as the creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fragrant leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces tiny, pink to purple flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent stems allow it to retain moisture, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for rock gardens or borders. Chamaefilix cirrhata is valued for its ornamental appearance and aromatic properties."
