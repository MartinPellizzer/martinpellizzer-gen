    "intro": "Clausia mollissima, commonly known as the soft-leaved clausia, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its large, velvety leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticulture."
