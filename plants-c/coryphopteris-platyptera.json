    "intro": "Coryphopteris platyptera, commonly known as the broad-leaf huperzia, is a fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its leathery, broad leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Coryphopteris platyptera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
