    "intro": "Caucaea duquei, commonly known as the Duque's caucaea, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, humid climate. Its leaves are usually elliptical and have a glossy texture, while its flowers are often white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Caucaea duquei is considered a rare and endangered species."
