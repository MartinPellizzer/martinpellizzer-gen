    "intro": "Chaerophyllum reflexum var. tuberosum, commonly known as the tuberous chaerophyllum, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are typically hairy and have a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense, terminal cluster. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its tuberous roots are an important feature, contributing to its resilience and ability to survive in wet conditions."
