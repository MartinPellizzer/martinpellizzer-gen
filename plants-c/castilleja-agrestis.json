    "intro": "Castilleja agrestis, commonly known as the prairie smoke, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients. The plant produces delicate, pink to red, plume-like flowers that resemble smoke, hence its common name. It typically grows in open prairies and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun. Its botanical features include slender stems and small, narrow leaves, making it a distinctive member of the Orobanchaceae family."
