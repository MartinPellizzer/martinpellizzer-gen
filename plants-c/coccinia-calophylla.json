    "intro": "Coccinia calophylla, commonly known as the golden star gooseberry, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright orange, fleshy berries. These berries are edible when ripe and have a tangy, sweet flavor. Coccinia calophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant fruit and foliage."
