    "intro": "Cupressus abramsiana subsp. locatellii, commonly known as the Sierra Madre cypress, is a rare and endemic species native to California. It is characterized by its narrow, pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spherical cones that release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
