    "intro": "Carex elata var. homalocarpa, commonly known as the tall sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like foliage and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The leaves are typically narrow, cylindrical, and have a smooth, glossy surface."
