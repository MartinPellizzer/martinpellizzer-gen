It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in brackish or saline wetlands. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptical in shape. Its flowers are small and yellowish, arranged in clusters, and it produces woody, elliptical fruits containing a single seed. This variant is adapted to tidal environments and plays a role in stabilizing shorelines through its extensive root system."
