    "intro": "Carex flaccosperma var. pigra, commonly known as the slender spikerush, is a wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, ribbed leaves and spikes of small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its reproductive structures are wind-pollinated, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds. This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more compact growth compared to the typical form of Carex flaccosperma."
