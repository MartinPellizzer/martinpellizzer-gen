    "intro": "Centropogon carnosus, commonly known as the beefsteak plant, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, red or pink flowers that resemble beefsteak. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thick, succulent leaves that store water, adapting to its tropical and semi-arid habitats. Its flowers are often clustered in spikes and are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Centropogon carnosus is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its traditional uses in herbal medicine."
