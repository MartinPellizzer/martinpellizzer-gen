It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland edges. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to other watercress varieties."
