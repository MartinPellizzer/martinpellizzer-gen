    "intro": "Cercocarpus rotundifolius, commonly known as the Sierra stonecrop, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
