    "intro": "Cordia crispiflora, commonly known as the crinkled cotton tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its ovate, slightly crinkled leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found in mangrove or brackish water areas. The plant is valued for its ornamental appearance and has traditional uses in some indigenous cultures."
