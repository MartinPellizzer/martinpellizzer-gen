    "intro": "Corynephorus canescens var. montana, commonly known as the mountain false brome, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
