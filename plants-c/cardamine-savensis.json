    "intro": "Cardamine savensis, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate white or yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as meadows and forest floors. It has trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture and produces numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its habitat preferences, it is often found in alpine and subalpine zones where temperatures are cool and conditions are damp."
