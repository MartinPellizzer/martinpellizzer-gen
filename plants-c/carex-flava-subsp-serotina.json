    "intro": "Carex flava subsp. serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering yellow sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. This subspecies is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, yellowish flowers that bloom later in the growing season. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
