It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and fleshy, succulent stems. The plant produces small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. Ceropegia ringens is often cultivated as a decorative plant for its trailing foliage and ease of care."
