    "intro": "Coelogyne cinnamomea, commonly known as the cinnamon orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that range in color from yellow to orange-red, often with a cinnamon-like scent. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its pseudobulbs are stout and cylindrical, supporting its evergreen foliage. The orchid blooms during the rainy season, producing clusters of showy flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
