    "intro": "Calligonum \u00d7 cordatum, commonly known as the hybrid saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a cross between Calligonum leporinum and Calligonum trichotomum, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable species for reclaiming degraded lands. It has small, narrow leaves and produces yellow flowers in late summer. Its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions makes it an important component of desert ecosystems."
