    "intro": "Cyperus sahelii, commonly known as the Sahelian flatsedge, is a perennial herb native to the Sahel region of Africa. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and lakes. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that are often reddish or brown in color. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in these regions. Cyperus sahelii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small animals and insects."
