It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and streams. The plant has small, floating leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. Its flowers are delicate and usually white or pale pink, appearing in clusters near the water surface. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters and its role in supporting aquatic ecosystems."
