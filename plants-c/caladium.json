    "intro": "Caladium, commonly known as the \"coleus\" or \"angel's trumpets,\" is a tropical plant native to South America. It is prized for its vibrant, colorful leaves that come in shades of red, pink, white, and green. The leaves are typically heart-shaped or arrow-shaped and are the main ornamental feature of the plant. Caladiums thrive in warm, humid climates and prefer well-draining soil. They are often grown as houseplants or in gardens where they can add a striking visual impact."
