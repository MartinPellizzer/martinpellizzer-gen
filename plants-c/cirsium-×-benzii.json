    "intro": "Cirsium \u00d7 benzii, commonly known as the hybrid thistle, is a perennial plant characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers. It is a natural hybrid between Cirsium vulgare and Cirsium palustre, resulting in a plant that exhibits traits from both parent species. The leaves are typically lance-shaped with marginal spines, while the stems are upright and hairy. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. This plant plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes considered invasive in certain regions."
