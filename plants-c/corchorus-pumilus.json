It is native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically broad and fleshy, adapted to conserve water, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous. Corchorus pumilus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience to harsh conditions."
