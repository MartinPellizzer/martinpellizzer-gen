    "intro": "Cheilanthes horridula, commonly known as the rough fringed bladder fern, is a terrestrial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its robust, wiry rhizomes and dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is often found in crevices and on rock faces in desert environments."
