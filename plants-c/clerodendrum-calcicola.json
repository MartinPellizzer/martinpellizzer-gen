    "intro": "Clerodendrum calcicola, commonly known as the limestone clerodendrum, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry landscapes."
