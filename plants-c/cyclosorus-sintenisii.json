    "intro": "Cyclosorus sintenisii, commonly known as the Sintenis' cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically divided into four lobes, resembling a four-leaf clover. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in shallow, nutrient-rich waters. Its reproductive structures, including tiny spore-producing organs, are located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclosorus sintenisii is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality and ecological health."
