    "intro": "Croton verrucosus, commonly known as the warty croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in small, raised bumps or tubercles. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by spiny, orange-red fruits. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Croton verrucosus is also valued as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage."
