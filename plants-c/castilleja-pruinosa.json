    "intro": "Castilleja pruinosa, commonly known as the pruinose Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, red-orange bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant has a shallow root system that attaches to the roots of other plants, drawing nutrients from them. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Castilleja pruinosa blooms in late spring to early summer, producing small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds."
