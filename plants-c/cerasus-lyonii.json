    "intro": "Cerasus lyonii, commonly known as the Lyon cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching structure and showy white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature, though they are not as widely cultivated as other cherry species. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable ornamental plant in gardens. The Lyon cherry is also valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various climates."
