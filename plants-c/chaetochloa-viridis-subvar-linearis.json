    "intro": "Chaetochloa viridis subvar. linearis, commonly known as the slender green hairgrass, is a grass species native to wetland and marsh environments. It is characterized by its fine, linear leaves that are typically less than 2 mm in width. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with greenish-yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in temperate regions. Its dense growth habit makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
