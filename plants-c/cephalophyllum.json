    "intro": "Cephalophyllum, commonly known as the crown of thorns, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae. It is characterized by its unique, flattened, ribbed stems that resemble a crown, hence its common name. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically yellow or red, often with a distinctive, spiky appearance. Cephalophyllum species are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. These plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
