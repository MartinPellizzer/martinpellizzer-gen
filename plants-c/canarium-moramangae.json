    "intro": "Canarium moramangae, commonly known as the Moramanga nut tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that enclose a single seed, which is used for its edible nut. Canarium moramangae is adapted to grow in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
