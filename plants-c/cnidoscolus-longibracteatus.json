    "intro": "Cnidoscolus longibracteatus, commonly known as the giant arrowhead or arrowleaf, is a tropical perennial plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its native humid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, spiny fruits that contain several seeds. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in wetland or marshy habitats. The plant is also notable for its ability to accumulate heavy metals, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts."
