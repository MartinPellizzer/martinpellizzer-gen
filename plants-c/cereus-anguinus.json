    "intro": "Cereus anguinus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems and its ability to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces large, white flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance. These flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few hours. Cereus anguinus is well adapted to desert conditions, with thick stems that store water and reduce transpiration."
