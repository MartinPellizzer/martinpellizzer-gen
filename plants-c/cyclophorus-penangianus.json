    "intro": "Cyclophorus penangianus, commonly known as the Penang cyclophorus, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Penang in Malaysia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that are typically orange or red in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are ovate and glossy, with a velvety texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to habitat loss, Cyclophorus penangianus is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
