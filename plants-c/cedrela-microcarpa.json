    "intro": "Cedrela microcarpa, commonly known as the Honduras mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, aromatic bark and elongated, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its high-quality, durable wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered in many regions."
