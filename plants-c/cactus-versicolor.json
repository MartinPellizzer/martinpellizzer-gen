    "intro": "Cactus versicolor, commonly known as the variable cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny stems and ability to store water in its thick, fleshy tissues. The plant exhibits a range of color variations in its flowers, which can range from yellow to orange to red, depending on environmental conditions. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. Cactus versicolor thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it well adapted to desert environments."
