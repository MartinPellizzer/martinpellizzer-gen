    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris ventosa, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white or pinkish flowers and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, bladder-like seed pods that burst open to disperse seeds when disturbed. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a common weed but also a subject of study in plant ecology and botany."
