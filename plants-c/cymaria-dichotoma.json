It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant features small, narrow leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, often with white or pale pink petals. It is adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in harsh coastal environments."
