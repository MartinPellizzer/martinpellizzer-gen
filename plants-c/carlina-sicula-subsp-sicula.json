It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, rough-textured leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces showy, yellow-centered composite flower heads that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Carlina sicula subsp. sicula is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
