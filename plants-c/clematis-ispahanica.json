It features slender, twining stems that can grow up to 10 meters in length, supporting its climbing habit. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a slightly hairy texture. Clematis ispahanica thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
