    "intro": "Caladenia ashbyae, commonly known as the Ashby's spider orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family found in the south-western region of Western Australia. This terrestrial herbaceous plant typically grows to a height of about 20\u201330 centimeters, featuring a single, slender stem topped with a single, intricately shaped flower. The flower is characterized by its vivid red and yellow coloration, with a distinctive spider-like appearance due to its long, narrow petals and sepals. It blooms during the cooler months, usually between June and August, and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Caladenia ashbyae is listed as endangered due to habitat loss and fragmentation, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this rare botanical species."
