It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and heart-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, blue-violet flowers that are clustered in umbels, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are often reddish in color, which is a distinguishing feature. Commelina trachysperma thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks."
