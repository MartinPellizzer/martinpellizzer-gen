    "intro": "Crepis roylei, commonly known as the Himalayan mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to cold and harsh conditions. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The small yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by pale achenes, aiding in wind dispersal."
