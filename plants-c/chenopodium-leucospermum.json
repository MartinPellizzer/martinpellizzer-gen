The plant features alternate, ovate leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters. Its seeds are small and contain a high amount of oil, making it a potential source for oil extraction. The species is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a forage crop."
