    "intro": "Camellia japonica var. triumphans, commonly known as the Japanese camellia, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from deep red to pale pink, often with a contrasting white or yellow center. The plant produces elliptical, dark green leaves that are glossy and provide a striking backdrop to its blooms. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Camellias are also valued for their ability to bloom in winter, adding color to the landscape during the colder months."
