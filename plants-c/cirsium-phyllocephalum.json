    "intro": "Cirsium phyllocephalum, commonly known as the broadleaf thistle, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower structures."
