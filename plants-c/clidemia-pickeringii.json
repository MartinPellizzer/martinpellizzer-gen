It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its small, white to pink flowers and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky areas. It is an evergreen shrub that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Clidemia pickeringii plays a role in the ecological dynamics of Hawaiian ecosystems, though it is considered a non-native invasive species in some regions."
