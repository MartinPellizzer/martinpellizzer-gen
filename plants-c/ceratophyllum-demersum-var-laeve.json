    "intro": "Ceratophyllum demersum var. laeve, commonly known as water crown or coontail, is an aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial plant that grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant has dense, bushy, branching stems that are often covered with small, scale-like leaves. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, which are pollinated by wind and insects. This variety is widely used in aquariums and ponds for its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
