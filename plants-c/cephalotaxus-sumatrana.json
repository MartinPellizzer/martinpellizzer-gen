    "intro": "Cephalotaxus sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran yew, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Taxaceae and is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, reddish-brown cones that contain the seeds, which are surrounded by a fleshy, orange aril. It is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments, often found in mountainous areas with high rainfall. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
