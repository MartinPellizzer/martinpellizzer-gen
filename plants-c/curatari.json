    "intro": "Curatari, commonly known as the \"Brazilian rosewood,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. These plants are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are characterized by their woody stems and compound leaves. Curatari species often produce small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. The genus includes several species, such as Curatari macrophylla, which is valued for its hard, durable wood. Due to overharvesting, many Curatari species are now threatened with extinction."
