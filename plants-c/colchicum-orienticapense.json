    "intro": "Colchicum orienticapense, commonly known as the Eastern Persian colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Colchicaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a bulb-like structure called a corm, which serves as its storage organ and enables it to survive harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
