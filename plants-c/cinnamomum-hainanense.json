It is native to the island of Hainan in southern China and is characterized by its aromatic, dark-brown bark. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped, glossy, and emit a strong cinnamon scent when crushed. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers followed by oval-shaped berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife."
