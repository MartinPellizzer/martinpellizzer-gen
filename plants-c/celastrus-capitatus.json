    "intro": "Celastrus capitatus, commonly known as the golden dewdrop or yellow elder, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in wetland areas and along riverbanks. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain birds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, while its stems are woody and branched. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
