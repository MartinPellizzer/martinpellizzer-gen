    "intro": "Cleistanthium nepalense, commonly known as the Nepal cleistanthium, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India, typically found in moist, shaded forest understories. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in cupular inflorescences, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
