    "intro": "Crataegus blothra, commonly known as the Blotched Hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are edible but often tart. Its leaves are typically oval with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained soil in full sun. Crataegus blothra is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
