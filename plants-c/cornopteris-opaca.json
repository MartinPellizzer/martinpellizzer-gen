    "intro": "Cornopteris opaca, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, arching growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, kidney-shaped indusium. Cornopteris opaca plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small mammals."
