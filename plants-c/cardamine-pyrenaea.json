    "intro": "Cardamine pyrenaea, commonly known as the Pyrenean watercress, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize rocky or gravelly substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range."
