    "intro": "Chytroma andina, commonly known as the Andean chytroma, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying white or pale yellow hues. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
