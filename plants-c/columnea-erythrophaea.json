    "intro": "Columnea erythrophaea, commonly known as the red-flowered coca, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting hummingbirds and other pollinators. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, with a slightly hairy texture. Columnea erythrophaea is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its traditional use in certain cultural practices."
