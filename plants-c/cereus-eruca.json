    "intro": "Cereus eruca, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and ability to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Cereus eruca is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming pattern."
