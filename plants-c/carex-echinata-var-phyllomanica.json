    "intro": "Carex echinata var. phyllomanica, commonly known as the slender spikerush, is a variant of the spikerush genus Carex. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical spikes of small, usually wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and stiff, often with a slightly rough texture, and the inflorescence is composed of several spikelets. This variant is distinguished by its subtle morphological differences from the typical Carex echinata, particularly in leaf structure and flowering patterns."
