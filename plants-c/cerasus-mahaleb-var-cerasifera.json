    "intro": "Cerasus mahaleb var. cerasifera, commonly known as the cherry laurel, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It features dark green, glossy leaves and produces fragrant white flowers in spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. The plant is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and dense, rounded growth habit. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. However, it can be toxic if ingested, particularly the berries, which contain cyanogenic glycosides."
