    "intro": "Carex limosa subsp. rariflora, commonly known as the rare flowering sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
