    "intro": "Chamaesyce centralis, commonly known as the central sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with a mat-like growth habit, often forming dense colonies on sandy or rocky soils. The plant features small, pale green leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in the early summer. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Chamaesyce centralis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals."
