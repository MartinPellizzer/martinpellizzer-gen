    "intro": "Calamus peregrinus, commonly known as the wandering reed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear yellowish-white flowers. Calamus peregrinus is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, tropical environments. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical interest lies in its morphology and ecological role."
