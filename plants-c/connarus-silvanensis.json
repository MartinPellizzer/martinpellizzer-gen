    "intro": "Connarus silvanensis, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a slow-growing evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark-gray bark and small, leathery leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is highly valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is resistant to decay and used in construction and furniture. Due to its slow growth and habitat loss, it is also considered a threatened species in many regions."
