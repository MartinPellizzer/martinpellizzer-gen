    "intro": "Chromolaena revoluta, commonly known as croton weed, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually green with a reddish or purplish underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its adaptability to various soil types and climates makes it a persistent weed in disturbed habitats."
