It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and along stream banks. The plant has grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. It is characterized by its clumping growth habit and the presence of three-ranked leaves. Carex handelii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
