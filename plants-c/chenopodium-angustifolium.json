    "intro": "Chenopodium angustifolium, commonly known as narrowleaf goosefoot, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and has a sprawling growth habit. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and a bluish-green color. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, and it produces tiny, dry fruits known as achenes. It is often used in traditional herbal medicine and is also a food source for certain wildlife species."
