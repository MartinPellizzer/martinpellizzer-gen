    "intro": "Ctenium carolinianum, commonly known as Carolina hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along coastal areas and tidal marshes. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
