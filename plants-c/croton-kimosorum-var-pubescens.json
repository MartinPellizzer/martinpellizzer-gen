It is characterized by its thick, velvety leaves that are typically green with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens with suitable climate conditions."
