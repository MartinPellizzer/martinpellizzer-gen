It is a small, deciduous tree that thrives in coastal and limestone habitats. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruits are elongated pods containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
