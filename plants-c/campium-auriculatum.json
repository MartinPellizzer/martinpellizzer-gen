    "intro": "Campium auriculatum, commonly known as the earleaf milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features upright stems that can grow up to 2 meters tall, covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a distinctive auriculate (ear-like) base, giving it its common name. The plant is known for its milky sap, which is toxic and serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
