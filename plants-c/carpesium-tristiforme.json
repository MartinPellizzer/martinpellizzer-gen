It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small cones. The plant produces spiny, spherical fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are heart-shaped with three distinct lobes, giving it its common name. It is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields, where it thrives in full sun."
