    "intro": "Chevaliera stephanophora, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
