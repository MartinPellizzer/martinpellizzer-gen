    "intro": "Cirsium eriocephalum var. leiocephalum, commonly known as the softhead thistle, is a perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and rosette-forming leaves. The plant produces purple to pinkish flower heads that are covered in bracts, which are less densely haired than those of the typical *Cirsium eriocephalum*. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. The softhead thistle is an important plant for pollinators and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
