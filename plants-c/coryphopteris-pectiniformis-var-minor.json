    "intro": "Coryphopteris pectiniformis var. minor, commonly known as the slender tree fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in forest understories. Its fronds are often covered in a dense layer of brown, velvety spores, which are produced on the underside. This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
