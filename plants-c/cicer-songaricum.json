    "intro": "Cicer songaricum, commonly known as the Kashmir chickpea, is a leguminous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its small, rounded pods that contain several seeds, which are used as a food source. The plant thrives in cool, temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being elliptical in shape. Cicer songaricum is valued not only for its nutritional content but also for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation."
