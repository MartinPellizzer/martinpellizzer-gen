    "intro": "Cyrtomium fortunei var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate water fern, is a fern species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical value lies in its ornamental foliage. The plant is relatively easy to cultivate in humid, well-drained soils."
