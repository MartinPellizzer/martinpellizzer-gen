    "intro": "Carex flava subvar. elongata, commonly known as yellow sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow to golden-green foliage, which is narrow and grass-like in appearance. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in a loose, cylindrical inflorescence, with male and female flowers separated into distinct spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges. This subvariety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates."
