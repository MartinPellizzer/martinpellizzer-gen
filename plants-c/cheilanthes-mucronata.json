    "intro": "Cheilanthes mucronata, commonly known as the blunt-tipped rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, perennial plant that thrives in rocky soils and crevices, often found in desert environments. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces erect, compact foliage with lance-shaped, dark green fronds. Its spores are released from terminal, club-shaped sorus clusters on the underside of the fronds. This resilient fern is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
