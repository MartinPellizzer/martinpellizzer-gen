    "intro": "Ceanothus bicolor, commonly known as the coastal ceanothus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its clusters of blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral ecosystems. Ceanothus bicolor plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife."
