It is characterized by its pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its dense foliage makes it a valuable ornamental plant in horticulture."
