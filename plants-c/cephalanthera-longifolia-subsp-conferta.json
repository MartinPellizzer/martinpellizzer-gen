    "intro": "Cephalanthera longifolia subsp. conferta, commonly known as the clustered helmet orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette, and the subspecies is distinguished by its more compact growth habit compared to the typical form. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a protected species in many regions."
