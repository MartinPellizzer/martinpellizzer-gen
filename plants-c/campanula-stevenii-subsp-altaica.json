It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, which helps it withstand harsh alpine conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
