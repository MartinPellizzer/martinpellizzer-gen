    "intro": "Crepis magellensis, commonly known as the Magellan's hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive yellow ray florets and robust, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Crepis magellensis is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
