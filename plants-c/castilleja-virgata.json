    "intro": "Castilleja virgata, commonly known as the western prairie blazingstar, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, orange to yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in open grasslands and prairies, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it is well adapted to dry, sunny environments."
