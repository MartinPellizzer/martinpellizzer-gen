    "intro": "Cyclosorus tener, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are usually divided into four parts, resembling a tiny four-leaf clover. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can receive adequate sunlight. Its reproductive structures, including small flowers and fruits, are typically submerged, aiding in its propagation through water. Cyclosorus tener plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
