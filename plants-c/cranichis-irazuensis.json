    "intro": "Cranichis irazuensis, commonly known as the Iraz\u00fa orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to Costa Rica. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within cloud forests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its small, strap-like leaves are adapted to conserve moisture in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
