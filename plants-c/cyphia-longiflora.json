    "intro": "Cyphia longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered cyphia, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but often consumed by birds and small mammals. Cyphia longiflora thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for tropical gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
