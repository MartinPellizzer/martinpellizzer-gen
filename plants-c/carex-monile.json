    "intro": "Carex monile, commonly known as the bead sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered inflorescences that resemble beads, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Carex monile is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions."
