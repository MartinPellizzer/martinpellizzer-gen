    "intro": "Chaetochloa imberbis var. perennis, commonly known as the perennial hairgrass, is a grass species native to wetland and marsh environments. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, hair-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in coastal or freshwater marshes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
