    "intro": "Caralluma, commonly known as the desert fig or nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apocynaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Asia. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to harsh desert conditions. They produce small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often followed by fleshy, edible berries. Caralluma species are valued for their ornamental appeal and traditional uses in herbal medicine."
