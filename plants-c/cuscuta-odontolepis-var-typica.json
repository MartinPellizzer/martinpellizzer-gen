    "intro": "Cuscuta odontolepis var. typica, commonly known as the giant dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host plants. The plant is native to parts of Asia and is often found parasitizing crops such as rice and soybeans. Its rapid growth and ability to cause significant damage to agricultural plants make it a problematic weed. The species is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves and its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
