    "intro": "Coleus micranthus, commonly known as the small-flowered coleus, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful foliage rather than showy flowers. The leaves are typically heart-shaped or ovate, with a velvety texture and a wide range of colors including red, purple, and variegated patterns. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its striking appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pale blue or violet, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems."
