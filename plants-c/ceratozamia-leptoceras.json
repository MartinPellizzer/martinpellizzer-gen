    "intro": "Ceratozamia leptoceras, commonly known as the slender-leaf cycad, is a unique member of the Zamiaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically appearing on separate plants. It is native to Mexico and is adapted to grow in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
