    "intro": "Castilleja annua, commonly known as the annual Indian paintbrush, is an herbaceous plant native to North America. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant features showy, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite and linear, often covered in fine hairs. Castilleja annua typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as prairies and roadsides."
