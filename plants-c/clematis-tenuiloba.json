    "intro": "Clematis tenuiloba, commonly known as the slender clematis, is a climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant prefers partial shade to full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Its vines can reach lengths of up to 15 feet, requiring support such as trellises or fences. Clematis tenuiloba is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
