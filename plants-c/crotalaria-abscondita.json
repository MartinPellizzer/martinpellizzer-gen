It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod, and the plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility. However, it can be invasive in certain areas, posing a challenge for agricultural and ecological management."
