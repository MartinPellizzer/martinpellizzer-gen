    "intro": "Crepis virens var. uniflora, commonly known as the slender mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs. This variety is distinguished by its single-flowered head, which sets it apart from other Crepis species."
