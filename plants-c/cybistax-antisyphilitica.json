    "intro": "Cybistax antisyphilitica, commonly known as the syphilis plant, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes cashew and mango. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers and pinnately compound leaves. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in humid, shaded environments. Despite its historical association with treating syphilis, it is primarily valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in its native habitat."
