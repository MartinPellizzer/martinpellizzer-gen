    "intro": "Carex brizoides subsp. curvata, commonly known as the bentleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This subspecies is distinguished by its curved leaf blades, which give it its common name. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated, contributing to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
