    "intro": "Ceratospermum, commonly known as the \"devil's backbone,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, spiny seed pods that resemble a backbone, hence their common name. Ceratospermum species are typically shrubs or small trees, native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They produce showy, often yellow or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. The leaves are usually alternate and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface depending on the species."
