    "intro": "Cycas circinalis f. glauca, commonly known as the blue cycad, is a variant of the common cycad species Cycas circinalis. It is characterized by its striking blue-green foliage, which sets it apart from the typical green coloration of the standard form. The plant is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. It features a stout, unbranched trunk with a fibrous, spongy outer layer. The leaves are pinnately compound, with a long, narrow petiole and numerous leaflets that are usually arranged in a single row."
