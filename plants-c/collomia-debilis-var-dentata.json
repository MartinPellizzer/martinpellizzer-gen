    "intro": "Collomia debilis var. dentata, commonly known as the Sierra starflower, is a low-growing annual plant native to the western United States. It features delicate, star-shaped flowers that are typically blue to violet in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender stems and lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, which are characteristic of the varietal form dentata. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and slopes. The Sierra starflower plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is valued for its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
