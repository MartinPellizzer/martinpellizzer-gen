    "intro": "Commiphora oddurensis, commonly known as the African frankincense tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic resinous sap, which has been used traditionally for medicinal and incense purposes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and oval-shaped leaves with a leathery texture. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. The resin, known as frankincense, is harvested from the bark and has a strong, balsamic aroma."
