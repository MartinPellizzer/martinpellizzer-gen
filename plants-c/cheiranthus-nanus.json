    "intro": "Cheiranthus nanus, commonly known as the dwarf rocket, is a small annual flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters, featuring bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are lobed and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Cheiranthus nanus is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
