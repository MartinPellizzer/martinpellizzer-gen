    "intro": "Chaerefolium tenerrimum, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along rocky slopes. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
