    "intro": "Chamaerops humilis var. macrophylla, commonly known as the giant fan palm, is a variety of the dwarf date palm native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, giving it a striking visual presence. The plant typically grows as a solitary tree with a short, unbranched trunk and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its architectural form. Its leaves are dark green and have a distinctive, coarse texture, while its flowers are small and yellowish, appearing in clusters at the base of the leaves. This variety is well-suited to warm, sunny climates and requires well-draining soil to thrive."
