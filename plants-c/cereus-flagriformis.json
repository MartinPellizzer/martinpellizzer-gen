    "intro": "Cereus flagriformis, commonly known as the night bloomer or moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and the ability to produce large, fragrant flowers at night. The plant has a shallow root system and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight. Its flowers, which open at night, are typically white or pale pink and can last for several days. Cereus flagriformis is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and striking appearance."
