    "intro": "Canarium, commonly known as the candlenut tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Sapotaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are alternate and elliptic in shape. Canarium species produce small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. The fruit is a capsule that contains a single, hard-shelled seed, often used in traditional medicine and as a source of oil."
