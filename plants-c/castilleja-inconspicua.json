    "intro": "Castilleja inconspicua, commonly known as the western paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking red-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems and lacks true leaves, relying on its host plants for water and nutrients. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with various grasses and shrubs, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Castilleja inconspicua plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its habitat."
