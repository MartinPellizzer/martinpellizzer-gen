    "intro": "Celosia vanderystii, commonly known as the Vanderyst's cockscomb, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, flame-like inflorescences that resemble a rooster's comb. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its vibrant red, orange, or yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Celosia vanderystii is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its traditional uses in some African cultures."
