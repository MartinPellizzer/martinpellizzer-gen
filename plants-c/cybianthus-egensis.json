    "intro": "Cybianthus egensis, commonly known as the Enderby's lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Enderby in the Pacific. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in rocky crevices. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cybianthus egensis is considered a vulnerable species."
