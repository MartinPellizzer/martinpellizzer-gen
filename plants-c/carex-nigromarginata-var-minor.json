    "intro": "Carex nigromarginata var. minor, commonly known as the narrow-margin sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves that are typically dark green with a narrow black margin, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are usually clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, bogs, and stream banks. Carex nigromarginata var. minor is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
