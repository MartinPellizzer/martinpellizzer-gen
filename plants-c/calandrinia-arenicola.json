    "intro": "Calandrinia arenicola, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvacae family and is characterized by its small, showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy leaves adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. Calandrinia arenicola is also known for its ability to self-seed and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
