It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for native birds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions. Coprosma longiflora is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
