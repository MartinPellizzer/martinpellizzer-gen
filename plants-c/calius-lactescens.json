    "intro": "Calius lactescens, commonly known as the milky milkweed, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels. Its latex is milky and contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Calius lactescens is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid environments."
