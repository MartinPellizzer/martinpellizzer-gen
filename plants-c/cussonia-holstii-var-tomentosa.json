    "intro": "Cussonia holstii var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly cussonia, is a shrub-like plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates."
