    "intro": "Cardamine saxatilis, commonly known as the rock chickweed, is a small, herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and woodland floors. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Its root system is fibrous, and it reproduces through both sexual and vegetative means. Cardamine saxatilis is often found in calcareous soils and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, rocky habitats."
