The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its leaves are typically opposite and ovate. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
