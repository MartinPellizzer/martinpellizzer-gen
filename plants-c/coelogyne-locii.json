    "intro": "Coelogyne locii, commonly known as the Bornean orchid, is a species native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its humid, shaded environment. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with intricate patterns. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor. Coelogyne locii is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
