    "intro": "Crepidium quadrilobum, commonly known as the four-lobed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and its unique, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers with four distinct lobes, which are often clustered in a loose inflorescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in shaded, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a threatened species in many areas."
