    "intro": "Centaurea amara subsp. serotina, commonly known as bitter cocklebur, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with reddish-brown bracts. The species is known for its bitter taste, which is due to the presence of sesquiterpene lactones."
