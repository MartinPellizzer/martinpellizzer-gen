    "intro": "Carex nebrascensis var. ultriformis, commonly known as the Nebraska sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the central United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wet meadows, and is often found in prairie and wetland habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in its native range."
