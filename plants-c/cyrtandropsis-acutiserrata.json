    "intro": "Cyrtandropsis acutiserrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its pinnately compound leaves that are narrow and serrated. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
