    "intro": "Cereus glaucus, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and striking, showy flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a unique symbiotic relationship with a scion, often from the genus Hemionitis, which provides it with the necessary coloration. Its flowers are typically white or pink and emit a mild fragrance. Cereus glaucus is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight."
