    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis mespilifolia, commonly known as the Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its rapid growth and ornamental value, it is widely cultivated but can become invasive in certain regions."
