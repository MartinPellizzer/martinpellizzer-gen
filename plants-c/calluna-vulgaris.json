    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris, commonly known as heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and moorlands. Its leaves are needle-like and remain green throughout the year, contributing to its hardy nature. Calluna vulgaris plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
