    "intro": "Cymbopogon ambiguus, commonly known as wild lemon grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are aromatic and often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its essential oils, particularly citral, are valued for their strong lemon scent and various medicinal properties. Cymbopogon ambiguus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
