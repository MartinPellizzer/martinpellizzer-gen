It is characterized by its purple to pinkish-purple flowers and is part of the Asteraceae family. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and a robust root system. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is considered a noxious weed in parts of North America."
