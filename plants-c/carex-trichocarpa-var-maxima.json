    "intro": "Carex trichocarpa var. maxima, commonly known as the giant marsh sedge, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like foliage and produces cylindrical spikes of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It is also an important food source for various wildlife species."
