    "intro": "Cynanchum excelsum, commonly known as the tall milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist woodlands and along stream banks, reaching heights of up to 6 feet. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are clustered in umbels and produce a milky sap that can cause skin irritation. Cynanchum excelsum is also known for its medicinal properties, though its use is limited due to its toxic compounds."
