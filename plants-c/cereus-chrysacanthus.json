    "intro": "Cereus chrysacanthus, commonly known as the golden torch cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a tall, unbranched stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom at night, a characteristic feature of many cacti in the night-blooming cereus group. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system adapted to arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
