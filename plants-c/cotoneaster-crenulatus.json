    "intro": "Cotoneaster crenulatus, commonly known as the serrated cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, ovate leaves with serrated edges, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that persist into winter. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes. Due to its hardiness and aesthetic value, it is often used in ornamental horticulture."
