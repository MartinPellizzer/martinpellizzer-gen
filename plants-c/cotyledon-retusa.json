It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The leaves are often rounded or oval in shape and can develop a reddish tinge when exposed to bright sunlight. This plant is known for its ability to store water in its leaves, making it drought-tolerant. It produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the warmer months."
