    "intro": "Carex disticha, commonly known as the common sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist or wet environments, such as marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with three stamens and a three-lobed pistil, typical of the sedge family."
