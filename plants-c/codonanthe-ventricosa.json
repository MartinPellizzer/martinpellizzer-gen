    "intro": "Codonanthe ventricosa, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, showy flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions. Codonanthe ventricosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climatic conditions."
