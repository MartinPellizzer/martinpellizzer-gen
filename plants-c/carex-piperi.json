    "intro": "Carex piperi, commonly known as the Pipestem sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often dark green and have a slightly rough texture. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Carex piperi is often found in shaded areas and is an important component of wetland ecosystems."
