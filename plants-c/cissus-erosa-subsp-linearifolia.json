    "intro": "Cissus erosa subsp. linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed grape ivy, is a climbing vine native to southern Africa. It features heart-shaped, pale green leaves with a slightly waxy texture and prominent veins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, grape-like berries. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it suitable for trellises and vertical gardens."
