    "intro": "Cernohorskya grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered cernohorskya, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic plants such as carrots and parsley. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
