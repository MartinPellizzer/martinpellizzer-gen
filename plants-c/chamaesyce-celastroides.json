    "intro": "Chamaesyce celastroides, commonly known as the creeping ironweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a slightly rough texture. Chamaesyce celastroides is often found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and in open woodlands."
