    "intro": "Cactus triangularis var. aphyllus, commonly known as the spineless cholla, is a unique cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically green and covered in clusters of small, spineless bristles. The plant lacks true leaves, relying entirely on its stems for photosynthesis and water storage. It thrives in arid environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its distinctive appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and desert gardens."
