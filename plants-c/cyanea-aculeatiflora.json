    "intro": "Cyanea aculeatiflora, commonly known as the spiny-flowered Cyanea, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive spiny bracts and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal habitats, such as rocky shores and sand dunes, where it tolerates saline and wind-swept conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or red, with a strong scent that attracts pollinators like bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
