    "intro": "Cybele milnei, commonly known as the Milne's cybele, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant is distinguished by its striking violet-blue petals and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically important for conservation efforts."
