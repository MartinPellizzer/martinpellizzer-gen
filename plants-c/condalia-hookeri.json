The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in dry regions."
