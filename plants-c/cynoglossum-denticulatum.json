    "intro": "Cynoglossum denticulatum, commonly known as the heartwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped with finely toothed edges, giving it its common name. The plant produces blue to violet flowers in late summer, which are clustered in loose racemes. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Cynoglossum denticulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
