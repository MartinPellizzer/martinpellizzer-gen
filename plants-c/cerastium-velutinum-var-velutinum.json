It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a mat-forming growth habit, often found in moist, disturbed soils. It is part of the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its fleshy leaves and showy flowers. This species is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
