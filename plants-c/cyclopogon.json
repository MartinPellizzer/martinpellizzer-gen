    "intro": "Cyclopogon, commonly known as the cyclops orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and are characterized by their unique, showy inflorescences. Cyclopogon species typically feature a short, stocky rhizome and produce striking, often brightly colored flowers with a distinctive, elongated shape. They are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks, and require specific environmental conditions to thrive. Due to their rarity and specialized habitat needs, many Cyclopogon species are endangered and are of interest to botanists and conservationists."
