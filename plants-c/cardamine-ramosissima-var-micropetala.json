    "intro": "Cardamine ramosissima var. micropetala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water cress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. The plant features trifoliate leaves with small, lance-shaped lobes and produces tiny white or greenish flowers in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. The species is noted for its delicate appearance and is often found in calcareous soils."
