    "intro": "Cynometra madagascariensis subsp. madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is also considered a vulnerable species."
