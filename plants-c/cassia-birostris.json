    "intro": "Cassia birostris, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its bright yellow, pendulous flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has bipinnate leaves, which are divided into small, feather-like leaflets. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Cassia birostris is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
