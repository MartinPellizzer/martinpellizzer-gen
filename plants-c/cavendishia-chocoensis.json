    "intro": "Cavendishia chocoensis, commonly known as the Choc\u00f3 Cavendish, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in Colombia and Ecuador. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescences that can display shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the dense rainforests of the Choc\u00f3 region. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its humid habitat. Cavendishia chocoensis is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
