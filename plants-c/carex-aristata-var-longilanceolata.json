It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically lance-shaped and have a distinctive elongated base. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of brownish or reddish flowers, which are often borne on slender, leafless stems. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This variant is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
