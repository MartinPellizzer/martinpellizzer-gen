    "intro": "Calonyction speciosum var. vulgare, commonly known as the common tansy, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. It is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. While it is ornamental, it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
