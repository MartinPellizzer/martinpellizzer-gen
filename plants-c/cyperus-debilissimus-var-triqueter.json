    "intro": "Cyperus debilissimus var. triqueter, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a low-growing grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale to brownish flowers. The plant thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common species in wetland ecosystems. Botanically, it belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants."
