    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 signatum, commonly known as the showy lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy pink or purple pouch-shaped flower, which serves as a specialized structure for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often in rich, humusy soil. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single, striking flower per stem. This orchid is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also of interest in botanical research due to its hybrid origin and ecological adaptations."
