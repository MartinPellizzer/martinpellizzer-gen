    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 nobilis subf. pseudograndis, commonly known as the rough lemon, is a subspontaneous form of the mandarin orange. It is characterized by its thick, rough, and often pebbled rind, which distinguishes it from other citrus species. The plant typically has a compact growth habit with dark green, glossy leaves. Its flowers are fragrant and white, and the fruit is generally small, sour, and not typically consumed as a fruit. This variety is primarily used in horticulture for its ornamental value and as a rootstock in citrus cultivation."
