    "intro": "Clutia decandra, commonly known as the velvetleaf or clutia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, with opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that are typically borne in terminal or axillary inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Clutia decandra is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
