    "intro": "Catopsis paniculata, commonly known as the forest fern or catopsis, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green with a soft texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or in the undergrowth of forests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of its leaves. Catopsis paniculata plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native range."
