    "intro": "Carex pyrenaica var. grosseckii, commonly known as the Pyrenean sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or alpine habitats. It produces small, clustered spikes of brownish or yellowish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is distinguished by its larger, more robust leaves compared to the typical form of C. pyrenaica."
