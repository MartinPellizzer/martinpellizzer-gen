    "intro": "Chotekia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The flowers are typically small and clustered, with five petals that are usually pale yellow or white in color. Chotekia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and are often found in moist, disturbed habitats. These plants are sometimes considered weeds in agricultural settings due to their rapid growth and adaptability."
