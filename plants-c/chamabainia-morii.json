    "intro": "Chamabainia morii, commonly known as the Morii's ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, earning it its unique common name. The plant belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is known for its small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Chamabainia morii thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky crevices at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
