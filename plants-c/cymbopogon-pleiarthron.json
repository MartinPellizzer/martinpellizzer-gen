    "intro": "Cymbopogon pleiarthron, commonly known as the broadleaf grass or narrowleaf grass, is a species of perennial grass native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in open woodlands and savannas. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lipped flowers. Cymbopogon pleiarthron is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
