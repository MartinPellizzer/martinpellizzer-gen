    "intro": "Coryphantha longicornis, commonly known as the long-horned cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus with a globular shape and typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 centimeters. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. Its stems are ribbed and covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Coryphantha longicornis is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
