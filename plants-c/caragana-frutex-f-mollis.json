    "intro": "Caragana frutex f. mollis, commonly known as the softleaf shrub, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thornless growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are soft to the touch, as indicated by the specific epithet \"mollis.\" The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees. Its hardy nature allows it to thrive in poor soils and harsh climates, making it a valuable plant for erosion control. The wood is strong and durable, often used in local crafts and construction."
