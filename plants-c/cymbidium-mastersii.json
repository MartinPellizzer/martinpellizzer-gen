    "intro": "Cymbidium mastersii, commonly known as the Masters' orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in winter or early spring. The plant produces linear, grass-like leaves and has a sympodial growth habit, meaning it grows in successive shoots from the base. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Cymbidium mastersii is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
