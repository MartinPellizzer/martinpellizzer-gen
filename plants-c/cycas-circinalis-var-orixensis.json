    "intro": "Cycas circinalis var. orixensis, commonly known as the Orixensis cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires a warm, tropical climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
