It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, erect stem and a single, narrow leaf. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a loose raceme. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in pine flatwoods and wetlands. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions."
