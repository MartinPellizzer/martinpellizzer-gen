It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, while the flowers are small and clustered in a flat-topped inflorescence. Crantzia tetragona is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
