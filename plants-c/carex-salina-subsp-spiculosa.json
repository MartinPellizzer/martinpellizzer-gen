    "intro": "Carex salina subsp. spiculosa, commonly known as salt marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are typically clustered at the tips of its stems. This subspecies thrives in saline and brackish wetlands, often found in tidal marshes and estuaries. Its ability to tolerate high salt concentrations makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
