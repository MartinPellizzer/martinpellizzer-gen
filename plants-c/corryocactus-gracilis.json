    "intro": "Corryocactus gracilis, commonly known as the slender corryocactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a small, branching cactus with cylindrical stems that are typically green and covered in fine, white spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in desert gardens."
