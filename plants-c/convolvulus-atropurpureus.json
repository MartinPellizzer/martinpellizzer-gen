    "intro": "Convolvulus atropurpureus, commonly known as purple morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a sprawling annual vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped, violet to purple flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant produces small, round seeds enclosed in a capsule, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its rapid growth and attractive flowers make it both a garden ornamental and a potential weed."
