    "intro": "Cuscuta punana, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow flowers and has a vine-like structure with slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often found on crops such as soybeans and cotton. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, making it a persistent agricultural weed. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly reduce the yield of its host plants."
