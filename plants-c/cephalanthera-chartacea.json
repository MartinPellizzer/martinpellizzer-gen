    "intro": "Cephalanthera chartacea, commonly known as the chartaceous green orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its unique, greenish-yellow flowers that are often mistaken for leaves due to their leaf-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest floors. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake. Cephalanthera chartacea is known for its lack of chlorophyll, relying entirely on its mycorrhizal partners for energy."
