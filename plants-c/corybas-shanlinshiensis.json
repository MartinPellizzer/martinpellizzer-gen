    "intro": "Corybas shanlinshiensis, commonly known as the Shanlinshi Orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family native to China. This terrestrial orchid is characterized by its striking, helmet-shaped flowers that are typically dark purple or black, with a prominent white or yellow lip. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests, often growing on rocky substrates or in leaf litter. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow leaves that are usually clustered at the base, and it blooms during the late spring to early summer season. Its specialized floral structure is adapted for pollination by specific insect species, making it an important component of its native ecosystem."
