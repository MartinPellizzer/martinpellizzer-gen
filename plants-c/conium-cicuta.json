    "intro": "Conium cicuta, commonly known as poison hemlock, is a biennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in umbels. The plant contains toxic compounds, primarily coniine and other tropane alkaloids, which can be lethal to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in fields. Due to its similarity to edible plants like parsley, it poses a significant risk of accidental poisoning."
