    "intro": "Cypripedium singchii, commonly known as the Singchii lady's slipper, is a rare and elegant orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy pink and white flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, relying on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
