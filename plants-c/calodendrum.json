    "intro": "Calodendrum, commonly known as the flame tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bignoniaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. They are characterized by their showy, often orange or red, bract-based inflorescences that resemble flowers. The leaves are typically opposite and pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Calodendrum species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their vibrant blooms and tropical appearance."
