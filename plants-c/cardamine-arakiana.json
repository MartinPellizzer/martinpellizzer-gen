    "intro": "Cardamine arakiana, commonly known as the Japanese water shield, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features small, floating leaves that are heart-shaped and often covered in a waxy cuticle to prevent water loss. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow and are arranged in clusters, producing tiny seeds that are dispersed by water. This species is valued for its ecological role in aquatic ecosystems and its aesthetic appeal in wetland gardens."
