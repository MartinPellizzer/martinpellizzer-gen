    "intro": "Croton subcapitatus, commonly known as the Cape croton, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often bright green with a slight sheen. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by distinctive, spiny capsules that contain the seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. The botanical features of Croton subcapitatus make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
