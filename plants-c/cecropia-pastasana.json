    "intro": "Cecropia pastasana, commonly known as the giant cecropia, is a fast-growing tree native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and distinctive, hollow stems that provide habitat for various organisms. The plant is often found in disturbed areas and is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Its rapid growth rate makes it an important component of secondary forest succession. Cecropia pastasana also plays a role in supporting biodiversity by serving as a host plant for certain species of ants and insects."
