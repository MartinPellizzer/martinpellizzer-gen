    "intro": "Cyperus retroversus, commonly known as the reverse rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often forming dense clusters near water bodies. Its flowering spikes are usually inconspicuous, with small, scale-like bracts that protect the tiny flowers. Cyperus retroversus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
