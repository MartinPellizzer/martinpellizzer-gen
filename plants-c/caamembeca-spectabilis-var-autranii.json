    "intro": "Caamembeca spectabilis var. autranii, commonly known as the pink glorybower, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy pink to purple bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in panicles, often hidden beneath the vibrant bracts. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its ornamental value is primarily due to its long-lasting, colorful bracts that add visual interest to landscapes."
