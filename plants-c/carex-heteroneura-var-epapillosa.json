    "intro": "Carex heteroneura var. epapillosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike of small, spikelet-bearing flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is distinguished by its narrow, linear leaves and reduced leaf sheaths, contributing to its unique botanical appearance."
