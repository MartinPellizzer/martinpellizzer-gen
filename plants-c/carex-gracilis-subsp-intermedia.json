    "intro": "Carex gracilis subsp. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate sedge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands, where it thrives in well-drained to moderately wet soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often green or reddish in color. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands. This subspecies is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
