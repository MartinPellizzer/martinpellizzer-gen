    "intro": "Cystopteris sudetica var. leptophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaf water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Cystopteris. It is a small, aquatic fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. The species is notable for its finely divided leaves and is often found in the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia."
