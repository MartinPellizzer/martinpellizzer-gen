    "intro": "Croton brachybotryus, commonly known as the dwarf croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, colorful leaves that display a variety of hues, including red, orange, and yellow, due to the presence of anthocyanins and carotenoids. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens with suitable conditions."
