    "intro": "Calamagrostis lanceolata f. rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed grass reed, is a perennial grass species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a muted green. The plant produces panicles of small, fluffy flowers in late summer, adding a delicate ornamental quality to the landscape. Its reddish stems, which become more pronounced in the autumn, give it a distinctive appearance. This cultivar is often used in gardens for its aesthetic value and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
