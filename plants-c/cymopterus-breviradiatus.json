    "intro": "Cymopterus breviradiatus, commonly known as the short-rayed evening-primrose, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release the small, winged seeds when mature."
