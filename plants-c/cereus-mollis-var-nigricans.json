    "intro": "Cereus mollis var. nigricans, commonly known as the black-tipped night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are typically covered in white or pale green spines. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with plenty of sunlight. The varietal name \"nigricans\" refers to the dark coloration of its flower tips, which contrast with the pale petals."
