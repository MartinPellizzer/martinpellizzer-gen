    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 auroreum, commonly known as the golden tassel lily, is a hybrid orchid that exhibits a blend of characteristics from its parent species, Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium pubescens. It is native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe, where it thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a golden-yellow hue and a distinctive tassel-like structure at the top of the lip. Its leaves are typically dark green and heart-shaped, and it is often found growing in rich, humus-filled soils. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
