    "intro": "Chiococca nitida, commonly known as the silky chiococca, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in the Andean regions of Ecuador and Peru. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters, with smooth, glabrous bark. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a silvery or fuzzy appearance due to fine pubescence. Chiococca nitida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
