It consists of several species, most notably Cuttera macrophylla, which is native to tropical regions of Asia. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The sap of Cuttera contains latex, which can be used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory properties."
