    "intro": "Caragana microphylla f. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly bush clover, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. This variety is often used in landscaping and erosion control due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
