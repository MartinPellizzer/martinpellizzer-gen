    "intro": "Cardamine rubifolia, commonly known as redstem watercress, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many edible plants such as cabbages and mustards. The plant has slender, hairy stems that often grow in moist, shaded environments like woodlands and stream banks. Its small, white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and can be harvested for culinary use, though they are less commonly consumed than other watercress varieties."
