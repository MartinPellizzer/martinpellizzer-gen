    "intro": "Campanula cichoracea, commonly known as the bellflower or mouse-eared chickweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant has small, hairy leaves that are often lobed or toothed, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along streambanks. Campanula cichoracea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
