    "intro": "Cynanchum atrum, commonly known as black swallowwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and showy, purple-to-brown flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and wildlife. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a noxious weed in several regions."
