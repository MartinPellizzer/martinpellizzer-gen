    "intro": "Championella longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered championella, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open woodlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
