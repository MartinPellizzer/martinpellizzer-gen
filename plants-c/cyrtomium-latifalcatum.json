It features large, leathery, dark green fronds that are deeply divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The fronds are also popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
