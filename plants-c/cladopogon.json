    "intro": "Cladopogon, commonly known as the needle grass, is a genus of grasses belonging to the family Poaceae. These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, where they thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Cladopogon species are characterized by their narrow, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit. They often form dense mats or low shrubs, which help prevent soil erosion in their native habitats. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in restoration ecology due to their resilience and adaptability."
