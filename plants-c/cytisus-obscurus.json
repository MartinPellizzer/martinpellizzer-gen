    "intro": "Cytisus obscurus, commonly known as the dark scurvygrass, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of the United States. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and leathery, dark green leaves. This plant thrives in coastal environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. It is drought-tolerant and adapted to maritime climates with frequent fog and salt spray. The plant has historical uses in traditional medicine, though its toxicity limits modern applications."
