    "intro": "Chaetochloa macrosperma, commonly known as the giant hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats. Chaetochloa macrosperma is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to prevent erosion and provide habitat for aquatic life."
