    "intro": "Campanula ramulosa, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, providing a textured appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Campanula ramulosa is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
