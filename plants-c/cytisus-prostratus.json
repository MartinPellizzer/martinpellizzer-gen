    "intro": "Cytisus prostratus, commonly known as creeping yellow corymbia, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clustered corymbs, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, oval, and have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover."
