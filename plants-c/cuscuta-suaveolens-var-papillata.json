    "intro": "Cuscuta suaveolens var. papillata, commonly known as the sticky false dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, sticky coating on its stems that aids in attachment to host plants. The plant is native to various parts of the world and is often found on agricultural crops and ornamental plants. Its rapid growth and ability to cause damage to host plants make it a significant agricultural pest. The varietal name *papillata* refers to the papillate (bumpy) texture of its stems."
