    "intro": "Calliandra brevicaulis var. brevicaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved calliandra, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features compound leaves with small, thread-like leaflets that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers in terminal clusters, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice in arid landscapes."
