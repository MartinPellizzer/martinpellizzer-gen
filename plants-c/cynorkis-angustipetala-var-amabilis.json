    "intro": "Cynorkis angustipetala var. amabilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family, characterized by its ancient lineage and unique morphology. It features a stout, unbranched stem that remains underground, supporting a rosette of stiff, lanceolate leaves. The leaves are dark green, with a waxy texture and a distinctive midrib, and can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature known as dioecious reproduction. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade."
