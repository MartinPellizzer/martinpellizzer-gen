    "intro": "Corbichonia exellii, commonly known as the Exell's corbichon, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink and bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in botanical studies."
