    "intro": "Chrysopogon nemoralis, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often blue or purple in color. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Chrysopogon nemoralis is well adapted to wetland environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
