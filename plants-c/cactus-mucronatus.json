    "intro": "Cactus mucronatus, commonly known as the small-spine cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a short, thick stem and sparse, pale spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often clustered at the top of the stem. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to its harsh, dry environment. The cactus is typically found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
