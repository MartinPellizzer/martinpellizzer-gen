    "intro": "Cardamine pratensis subsp. rivularis, commonly known as water cowpea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a basal rosette structure, and its flowers are small, white or greenish, clustered in racemes. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found along stream banks and marshes. It is characterized by its short, stout stems and is typically less than 30 cm in height. This subspecies is often distinguished by its preference for aquatic or semi-aquatic environments compared to the typical form of Cardamine pratensis."
