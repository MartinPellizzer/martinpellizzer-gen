    "intro": "Coussapoa macarenensis var. antioquiensis, commonly known as the Antioquian fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate fronds with a unique, serrated edge. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks of trees in its humid, shaded habitat. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of moss, which helps retain moisture in its cool, moist environment. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered critically endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
