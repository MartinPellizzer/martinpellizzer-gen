    "intro": "Cotinus copallinus, commonly known as the smoke bush, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that turn vibrant shades of red, orange, and purple in the fall. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers in clusters, which give it the appearance of smoking, hence its common name. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental landscaping for its striking foliage. Cotinus copallinus is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators and its adaptability to various soil types."
