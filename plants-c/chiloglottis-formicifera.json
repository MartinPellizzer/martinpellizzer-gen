    "intro": "Chiloglottis formicifera, commonly known as the ant-feeding orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its unique morphology, including a narrow, leaf-like structure called a \"leaf-like petiole.\" The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are adapted for pollination by ants, which are attracted to its nectar. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Due to its specialized habitat and pollination strategy, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
