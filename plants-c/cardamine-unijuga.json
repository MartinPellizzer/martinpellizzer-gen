    "intro": "Cardamine unijuga, commonly known as the single-leaf watercress, is a small, herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like cabbages and mustards. The plant is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small white or yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as along streams or in woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
