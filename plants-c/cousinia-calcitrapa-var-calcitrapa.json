It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant features a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and produces small, pinkish to purple flowers in elongated clusters. It is known for its ability to thrive in low-nutrient soils and is often found in mountainous and steppe areas. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in ecological studies of xerophytic vegetation."
