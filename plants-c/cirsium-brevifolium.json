    "intro": "Cirsium brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved thistle, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its spiny, gray-green leaves and purple to pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe habitats. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
