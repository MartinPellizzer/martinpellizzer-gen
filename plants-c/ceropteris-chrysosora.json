    "intro": "Ceropteris chrysosora, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk that is covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rhizome. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. The fronds are evergreen and can grow up to several meters in length, making it a striking addition to botanical gardens."
