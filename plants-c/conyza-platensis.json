    "intro": "Conyza platensis, commonly known as white daisy or yellow starthistle, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is an annual herb that typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in various habitats such as roadsides and fields. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often surrounded by a crown of bracts. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it has a taproot system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. Conyza platensis is also known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it a common weed in many regions."
