    "intro": "Cerasus padus var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved bird cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It is often found in woodland edges and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
