    "intro": "Chelidonium majus lusus grandiflorum, commonly known as the greater celandine, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Papaveraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow, saucer-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has deeply lobed, hairy leaves that are often mistaken for those of other similar species. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread easily and form dense colonies. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in moist, disturbed soils."
