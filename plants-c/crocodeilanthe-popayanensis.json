    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe popayanensis, commonly known as the Popay\u00e1n fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the humid forests of Colombia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in the undergrowth of tropical rainforests. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires protection to ensure its survival."
