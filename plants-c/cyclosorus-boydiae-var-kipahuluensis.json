    "intro": "Cyclosorus boydiae var. kipahuluensis, commonly known as the Kipahulu cyclosorus, is a rare fern native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or forested slopes. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
