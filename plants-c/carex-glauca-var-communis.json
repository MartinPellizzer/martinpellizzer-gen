    "intro": "Carex glauca var. communis, commonly known as blue-green sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that ranges from blue-green to grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in moist to wet soils in woodland or wetland habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it a useful plant for erosion control and wetland restoration."
