    "intro": "Calligonum \u00d7 zaissano-muravljanskyi, commonly known as the hybrid saltbush, is a deciduous shrub native to Central Asia. It is a natural hybrid between Calligonum balcanicum and Calligonum trichophyllum, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant is adapted to arid and saline environments, with small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss. It produces yellow flowers in panicles, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. This hybrid is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils in degraded landscapes."
