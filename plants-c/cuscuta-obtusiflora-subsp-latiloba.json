    "intro": "Cuscuta obtusiflora subsp. latiloba, commonly known as the broad-leaved dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a tangled, vine-like appearance. The subspecies is characterized by its broader leaves compared to other dodder species. It is native to regions of North America and often grows on a variety of herbaceous plants. Its life cycle involves attaching to host plants via haustoria, which penetrate the host's tissues to extract water and nutrients."
