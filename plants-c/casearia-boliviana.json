    "intro": "Casearia boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian casearia, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Bolivia and Peru. It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by elliptical, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and potential ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
