It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
