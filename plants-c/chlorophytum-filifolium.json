    "intro": "Chlorophytum filifolium, commonly known as the snake plant or mother-in-law's tongue, is a hardy, evergreen perennial native to South Africa. It features upright, sword-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with prominent white or silver stripes. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and requires minimal watering, making it an ideal houseplant. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers on slender stalks, though these are rarely seen in indoor settings. Its air-purifying qualities and ease of care have made it a popular choice for both novice and experienced gardeners."
