    "intro": "Cyclosorus nitidulus, commonly known as the smooth cyclosorus, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically divided into four lobes, giving it a distinctive clover-like appearance. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can receive adequate sunlight and nutrients. Its rhizomes anchor it to the substrate, while its floating leaves help in photosynthesis. Cyclosorus nitidulus is often found in temperate regions and is noted for its ability to tolerate a range of water conditions."
