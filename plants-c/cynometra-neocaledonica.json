It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, pale green flowers followed by oval, woody fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland and montane rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
