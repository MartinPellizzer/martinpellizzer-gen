    "intro": "Chenopodium hircinum subsp. catamarcense, commonly known as the Catamarcense goosefoot, is a perennial herb native to South America, particularly Argentina. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, and its seeds are typically encased in a thin, papery pericarp. It thrives in dry, disturbed habitats and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
