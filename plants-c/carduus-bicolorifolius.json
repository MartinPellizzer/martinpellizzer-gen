    "intro": "Carduus bicolorifolius, commonly known as the two-colored thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and roadsides. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
