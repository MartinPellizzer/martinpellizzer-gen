    "intro": "Crinum roozenianum, commonly known as the African lily, is a striking ornamental plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that can be white, yellow, or pink, depending on the variety. The plant features strap-like, narrow leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Crinum roozenianum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
