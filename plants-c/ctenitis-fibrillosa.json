    "intro": "Ctenitis fibrillosa, commonly known as the fibrous ctenitis, is a species of sea anemone found in tropical marine environments. It belongs to the family Zoanthidae and is characterized by its delicate, branching polyps that are often covered in fine, fibrous structures. The organism typically attaches itself to hard substrates such as coral reefs or rocky seabeds. Its coloration can vary, often displaying shades of red, orange, or yellow, which helps it blend into its surroundings. Ctenitis fibrillosa plays a role in reef ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various small marine organisms."
