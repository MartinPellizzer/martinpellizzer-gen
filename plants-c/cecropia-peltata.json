    "intro": "Cecropia peltata, commonly known as the giant water fig, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its fruits are three-winged samaras that aid in wind dispersal. Cecropia peltata is also known for its association with ants, which live in the hollow stems and protect the tree from herbivores. Its rapid growth and unique morphology make it an important component of tropical ecosystems."
