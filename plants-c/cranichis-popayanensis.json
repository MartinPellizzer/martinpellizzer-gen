    "intro": "Cranichis popayanensis, commonly known as the Popayan orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers that typically exhibit a mix of white, green, and yellow hues. The plant is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients in its native arid environment. Its flowering period occurs during the dry season, and it thrives in well-drained soils with partial shade. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
