    "intro": "Cassia paniculata, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow, pendulous flowers that bloom in clusters, creating a striking visual display. The plant produces long, flat pods that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cassia paniculata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are lance-shaped and have a smooth or slightly serrated edge."
