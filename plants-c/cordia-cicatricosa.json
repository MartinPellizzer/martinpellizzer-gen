    "intro": "Cordia cicatricosa, commonly known as the scarred cordia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like trunk and opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to yellowish flowers, which are followed by woody, spherical fruits. Cordia cicatricosa is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments, making it a resilient species in dry landscapes. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their potential healing properties."
