    "intro": "Cachrys triquetra, commonly known as the three-lobed saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Saxifragaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
