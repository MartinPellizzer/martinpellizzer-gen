    "intro": "Carex tenuifolia, commonly known as slender thread sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spiky inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands, wetlands, and stream banks. Its foliage is often a deep green, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers in the summer. Carex tenuifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
