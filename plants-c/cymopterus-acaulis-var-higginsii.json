It is characterized by its basal rosette of finely divided, fern-like leaves and its clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer. The species is noted for its aromatic foliage and is adapted to withstand drought conditions through deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area."
