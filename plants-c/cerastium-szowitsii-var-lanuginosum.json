    "intro": "Cerastium szowitsii var. lanuginosum, commonly known as the woolly mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. The flowers are typically pink or white, borne in clusters at the ends of the stems, and bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
