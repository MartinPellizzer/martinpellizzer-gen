    "intro": "Campyloneurum castaneum, commonly known as the chestnut fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its erect, branching fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The fronds are pinnately compound, with lanceolate pinnae that have serrated margins. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a distinctive feature of its reproductive structure."
