It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that often display vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as swamps and marshes. Its foliage is the primary ornamental feature, making it popular in water gardens and as a houseplant. Caladium cucullatum produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are rarely seen above the foliage."
