    "intro": "Cuscuta australis var. glandulosa, commonly known as the Australian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to Australia and is often found growing on a variety of plants, including grasses and shrubs. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, allowing it to spread widely. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause damage to agricultural and ornamental plants."
