    "intro": "Chaseopsis, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, often bioluminescent flowers that emit a faint glow in the dark. These plants are native to the Andes Mountains in South America, where they thrive in high-altitude environments. Chaseopsis species typically have slender stems and small, clustered leaves. Due to their unique appearance and limited distribution, they are considered rare and are of interest to botanists and conservationists."
