    "intro": "Cecropia tacuna, commonly known as the giant cecropia, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and striking, showy flowers. The plant has a unique symbiotic relationship with ants, which inhabit the hollow stems and provide protection against herbivores. Its rapid growth rate makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects. The bark and leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
