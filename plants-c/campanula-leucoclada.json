    "intro": "Campanula leucoclada, commonly known as the white bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom in late summer. The plant has a basal rosette of leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its stems are upright and can grow up to 30 cm in height, supporting the clusters of flowers. Campanula leucoclada is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine environments."
