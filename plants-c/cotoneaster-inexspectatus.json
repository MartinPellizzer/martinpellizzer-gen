    "intro": "Cotoneaster inexspectatus, commonly known as the rare or uncommon cotoneaster, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the autumn. Cotoneaster inexspectatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and adaptability. However, due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
