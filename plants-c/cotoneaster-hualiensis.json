It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers in the spring. The plant bears red berries that are typically eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Cotoneaster hualiensis thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade conditions. It is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and seasonal interest."
