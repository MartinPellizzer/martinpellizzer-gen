    "intro": "Coelogyne odoratissima, commonly known as the fragrant coelogyne, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, often yellow or orange-colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers emit a strong, sweet scent, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Coelogyne odoratissima is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and distinctive fragrance."
