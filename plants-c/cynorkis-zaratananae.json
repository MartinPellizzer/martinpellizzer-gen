    "intro": "Cynorkis zaratananae, commonly known as the Zaratanana cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered critically endangered. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
