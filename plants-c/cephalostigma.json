    "intro": "Cephalostigma, commonly known as the \"head shield\" or \"cap plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cucurbitaceae. It is characterized by its unique, shield-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern. The flowers are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, a feature common in many cucurbit species. The fruit is a small, round berry that contains several seeds. These plants are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, well-drained soils."
