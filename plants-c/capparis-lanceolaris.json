It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, often found in the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, giving it its common name. The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is adapted to withstand coastal conditions such as salt spray and strong winds. It is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
