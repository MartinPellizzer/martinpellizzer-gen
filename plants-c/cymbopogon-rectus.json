    "intro": "Cymbopogon rectus, commonly known as narrowleaf lemon grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in panicles, which are typically clustered at the top of the stems. Its essential oils, particularly citral, are widely used in perfumes, food flavoring, and traditional medicine. Cymbopogon rectus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its aromatic properties and ornamental value."
