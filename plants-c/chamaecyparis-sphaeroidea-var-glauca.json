    "intro": "Chamaecyparis sphaeroidea var. glauca, commonly known as the Blue Pacific cedar, is a variant of the Pacific cedar native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, bluish-gray foliage that gives it a striking appearance. The plant has a compact, spherical shape, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a decorative shrub. Its leaves are scale-like and closely pressed to the stems, contributing to its dense appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, requiring minimal maintenance once established."
