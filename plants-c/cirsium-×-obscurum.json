    "intro": "Cirsium \u00d7 obscurum, commonly known as the common thistle, is a hybrid species within the thistle family (Compositae). It is characterized by its spiny, purple flower heads and deeply lobed, gray-green leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It is native to Europe but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. Its botanical features make it both a notable weed and a subject of ecological study."
