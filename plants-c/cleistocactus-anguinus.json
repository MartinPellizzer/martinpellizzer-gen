    "intro": "Cleistocactus anguinus, commonly known as the snake-like cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that resemble a snake, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, a trait typical of many nocturnal flowering plants. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for desert environments. The cleistocactus anguinus is also known for its ability to store water in its stem, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
