    "intro": "Cusso, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It has dark green, leathery leaves that are opposite in arrangement and emit a strong, spicy aroma when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed."
