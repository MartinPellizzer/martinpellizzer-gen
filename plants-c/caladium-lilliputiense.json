    "intro": "Caladium lilliputiense, commonly known as the miniature caladium, is a rare and delicate tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that display vibrant patterns of red, pink, and white. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few inches, making it an ornamental favorite for shaded garden spaces. Its foliage is the primary ornamental feature, as it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are not showy. Due to its rarity and specific growing requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments such as greenhouses."
