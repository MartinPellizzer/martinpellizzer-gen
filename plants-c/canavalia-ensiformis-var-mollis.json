It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are soft and hairy, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces long, cylindrical pods that contain edible seeds, though the seeds contain toxic compounds and should be handled with care. It thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated for its nutritional value and use in traditional medicine. The plant also has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
