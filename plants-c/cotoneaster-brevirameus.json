    "intro": "Cotoneaster brevirameus, commonly known as the short-stemmed cotoneaster, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of China and the Tibetan Plateau. The plant is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces small, red berries that are edible for birds and mammals. Cotoneaster brevirameus typically grows at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters, thriving in rocky and well-drained soils. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness in colder climates."
