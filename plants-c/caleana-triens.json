    "intro": "Caleana triens, commonly known as the pink honey-lip, is a striking orchid species native to Australia. It is characterized by its unique, pinkish-red floral structure that resembles a bee's face, which is an adaptation to attract specific pollinators. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive lip that secretes nectar to lure in its primary pollinator, the male honeybee. It thrives in heathland and open forests, often in well-drained sandy soils. Due to its specialized pollination mechanism and habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
