    "intro": "Curio rowleyanus, commonly known as the string of pearls plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features cascading clusters of small, round, fleshy leaves that resemble pearls, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
