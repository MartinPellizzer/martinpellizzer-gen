    "intro": "Colutea kunawarensis, commonly known as the Japanese burr vetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces distinctive, spiny pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
