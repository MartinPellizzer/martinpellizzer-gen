    "intro": "Carex cespitosa var. dacica, commonly known as the Dacian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of ponds. It has narrow, erect leaves that are often clustered at the base, forming a compact rosette. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting wetland biodiversity."
