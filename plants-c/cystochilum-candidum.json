    "intro": "Cystochilum candidum, commonly known as the white-stemmed marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wet, marshy habitats and is characterized by its slender, white or pale green stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose spike, which bloom during the wet season. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the waterlogged soil, and it is often found in association with other wetland flora. Cystochilum candidum is relatively rare and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive."
