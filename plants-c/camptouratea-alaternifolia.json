    "intro": "Camptouratea alaternifolia, commonly known as the sweetleaf tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement and have a distinctive, slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, round fruits with a sweet, aromatic pulp. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its shade-providing properties."
