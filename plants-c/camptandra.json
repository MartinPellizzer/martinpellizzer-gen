    "intro": "Camptandra, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale, ghostly flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often clustering at the base, while its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture from the air. Due to its habitat specificity and endangered status, Camptandra is a subject of conservation interest and botanical study."
