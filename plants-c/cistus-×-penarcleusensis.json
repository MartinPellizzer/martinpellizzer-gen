    "intro": "Cistus \u00d7 penarcleusensis, commonly known as the hybrid rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and clusters of pink to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and coastal environments. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cistus \u00d7 penarcleusensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soils in harsh conditions."
