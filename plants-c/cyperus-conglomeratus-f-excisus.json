    "intro": "Cyperus conglomeratus f. excisus, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a variant of the Cyperus genus native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, inconspicuous flowers. This form is distinguished by its more refined leaf structure compared to the typical form of Cyperus conglomeratus."
