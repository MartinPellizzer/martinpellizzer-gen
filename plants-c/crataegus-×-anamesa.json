It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters and features thorned branches, oval to ovate leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of white or pink flowers in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a variety of soil types and climates."
