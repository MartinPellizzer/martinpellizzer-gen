    "intro": "Carex shanensis, commonly known as Shan sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to China and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in a dense rosette, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Carex shanensis is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
