    "intro": "Corylus colurna, commonly known as the Turkish hazelnut or the Caucasian hazelnut, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Mediterranean and the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and oval, serrated leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces catkins in early spring, followed by edible nuts enclosed in a spiky husk. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Corylus colurna is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional agriculture."
