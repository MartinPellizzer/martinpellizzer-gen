    "intro": "Cyperus ephemerus, commonly known as the ephemeral sedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions, often going dormant during periods of drought. Its short lifespan, typically living only a few months, is reflected in its common name. Cyperus ephemerus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
