    "intro": "Cytisus paczoskii, commonly known as the Pacific broom, is a flowering shrub native to the western coast of North America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or pea family, characterized by its pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
