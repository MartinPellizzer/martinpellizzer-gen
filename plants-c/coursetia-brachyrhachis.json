    "intro": "Coursetia brachyrhachis, commonly known as the short-stemmed coursetia, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in drought conditions. Its stems are often woody and covered in a rough, fibrous texture. Coursetia brachyrhachis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils."
