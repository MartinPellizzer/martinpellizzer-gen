This perennial plant is characterized by its distinctive, slipper-shaped flowers that range in color from deep violet to bright yellow. It thrives in cool, moist environments at elevations between 3,000 and 4,500 meters. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and the plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
