    "intro": "Campanula scheuchzeri subvar. valdensis, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 1,500 meters. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
