    "intro": "Crocus scepusiensis, commonly known as the Scepusian crocus, is a rare and ancient species of flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, early spring-blooming flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or white, with three petals and six tepals. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several countries."
