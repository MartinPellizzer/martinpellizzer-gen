    "intro": "Corindum halicacabum, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert and semi-desert environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and silvery-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh climates. Corindum halicacabum is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
