    "intro": "Commiphora africana var. rubriflora, commonly known as the red-flowered African myrrh, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from yellow to red, which appear in clusters during the flowering season. Its resin, similar to frankincense, has been used traditionally for its aromatic and medicinal properties. The species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions."
