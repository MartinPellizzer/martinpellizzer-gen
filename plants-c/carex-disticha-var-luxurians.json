    "intro": "Carex disticha var. luxurians, commonly known as the silver sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically silver-gray in color due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous brown flowers arranged in a spike, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in pond margins or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
