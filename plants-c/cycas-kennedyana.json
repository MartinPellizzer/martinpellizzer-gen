    "intro": "Cycas kennedyana, commonly known as the Kennedy cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the island of New Guinea and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves. The plant produces cones instead of flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Cycas kennedyana is a slow-growing species that can live for centuries, making it a valuable subject for botanical study. Its conservation status is threatened due to habitat loss and over-collection."
