    "intro": "Cousinia chejrabadensis, commonly known as the Chejrabad cushion plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of Afghanistan. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, hairy leaves and yellowish-white composite flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited water availability. Its unique morphology allows it to efficiently capture and retain moisture in its harsh native habitat. Cousinia chejrabadensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its mountainous environment and is of interest for its potential ecological and horticultural value."
