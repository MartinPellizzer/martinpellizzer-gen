    "intro": "Citharexylum barbinerve, commonly known as the velvetleaf citharexylum, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often hairy on the underside, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
