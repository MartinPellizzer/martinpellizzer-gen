    "intro": "Catenularia hedysaroides, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow flowers in late spring. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. Catenularia hedysaroides is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and mountain slopes."
