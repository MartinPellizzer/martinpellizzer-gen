    "intro": "Crataegus flavida, commonly known as the yellow hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red-orange berries in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and has thorny branches, which are a distinguishing feature. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip. Crataegus flavida thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and woodland edges."
