It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant has a compact, mat-like growth habit with hairy stems and leaves that are adapted to conserve water. Its flowers bloom in spring and are pollinated primarily by insects. Calcearia aristata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping."
