    "intro": "Carlowrightia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved carlowright, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, small leaves and clusters of white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators like bees and flies, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
