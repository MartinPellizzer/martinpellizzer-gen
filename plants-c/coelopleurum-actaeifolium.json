    "intro": "Coelopleurum actaeifolium, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, followed by wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland and shrubland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
