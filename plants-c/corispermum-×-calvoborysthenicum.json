    "intro": "Corispermum \u00d7 calvoborysthenicum, commonly known as the hybrid bladderwort, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is a natural hybrid between Corispermum calvoborysthenicum and Corispermum borysthenicum, both native to Central Asia. The plant is characterized by its small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds with a distinctive mucilaginous coating. It typically grows in saline or arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions through its specialized morphology. Due to its limited distribution and hybrid origin, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
