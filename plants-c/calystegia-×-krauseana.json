    "intro": "Calystegia \u00d7 krauseana, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a hybrid vine species belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its rapid growth and sprawling habit, often covering the ground with its broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, blooming in the morning. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides or in gardens. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
