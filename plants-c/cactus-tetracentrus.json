    "intro": "Cactus tetracentrus, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its spherical shape and bright yellow spines that give it its common name. The plant has a thick, water-storing stem that helps it survive in arid environments. It produces yellow flowers during the rainy season, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for succulent gardens and indoor plant collections."
