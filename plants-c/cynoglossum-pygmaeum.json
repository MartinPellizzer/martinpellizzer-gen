    "intro": "Cynoglossum pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces delicate blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders."
