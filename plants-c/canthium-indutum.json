    "intro": "Canthium indutum, commonly known as the rough-seeded spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and often spiny structures. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous annual or perennial, with simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in complex inflorescences called cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Canthium indutum is adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and can often be found in open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges."
