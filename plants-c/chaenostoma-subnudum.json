    "intro": "Chaenostoma subnudum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has delicate, elongated leaves that are often less than 1 cm in width, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color, and appear in clusters near the water's surface. Chaenostoma subnudum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates."
