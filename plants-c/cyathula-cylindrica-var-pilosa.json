It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, cup-shaped cyathium inflorescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its fruit is a three-lobed, bladder-like capsule that contains several seeds. The hairy texture of its stems and leaves gives it its common name and contributes to its unique appearance."
