    "intro": "Cyperus piceus f. squalidus, commonly known as the squalid flatsedge, is a variant of the common flatsedge, characterized by its reduced, often sterile inflorescences. It is a flowering plant in the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist habitats, where it thrives in shallow water or damp soil. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and a basal rosette structure, which helps it conserve water. The inflorescence is usually shorter and less showy compared to the typical form of Cyperus piceus."
