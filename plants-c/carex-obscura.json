    "intro": "Carex obscura, commonly known as the obscure sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it produces dark brown to black seeds. Carex obscura is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
