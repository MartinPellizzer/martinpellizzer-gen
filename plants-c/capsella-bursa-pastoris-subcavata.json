    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris subcavata, commonly known as the common weed or shepherd's purse, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive triangular seed pods that split open when mature, releasing small, rounded seeds. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in various habitats across temperate regions. It has small, alternate leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its botanical features make it a common indicator of soil disturbance and a subject of study in ecological and agricultural contexts."
