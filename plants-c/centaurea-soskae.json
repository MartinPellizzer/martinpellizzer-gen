    "intro": "Centaurea soskae, commonly known as the Soska's cornflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually blue or purple, with bright yellow centers, and it produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Centaurea soskae is a relatively rare species, often found in specific microhabitats, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists."
