    "intro": "Comborhiza virgata, commonly known as the Virginia comb fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, feathery fronds that resemble a comb. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are horizontal and produce both roots and new shoots, contributing to its spreading growth habit. The leaves are bipinnate, with small, linear pinnae that give the plant its unique appearance."
