    "intro": "Cerea, commonly known as the wax plant, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its waxy, thick leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often surrounded by colorful bracts. Cerea thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
