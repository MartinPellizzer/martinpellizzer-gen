    "intro": "Crotalaria parvula, commonly known as the small cowpea or lesser crotalaria, is a flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its small, yellowish-white flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, which are often used as a food source for livestock. It is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a useful plant in agricultural settings. However, it can be invasive in certain environments and is sometimes considered a weed."
