    "intro": "Colanthelia intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate colanthelia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Melanthiaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in wetland and swampy habitats. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered white or greenish flowers during the spring and early summer. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, which is typical for many plants in its family. Colanthelia intermedia is often found in moist, shaded environments and is an important component of wetland ecosystems."
