    "intro": "Colpodium trollii, commonly known as the Troll's bladder, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, bladder-like structures that contain a sticky, resinous substance. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its flowers are inconspicuous, usually green or reddish, and it relies on wind pollination. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, Colpodium trollii is considered a rare and sensitive species."
