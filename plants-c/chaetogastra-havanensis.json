It is a terrestrial herb with a short, creeping rhizome and produces slender, hairy stems. The plant features showy, butterfly-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
