    "intro": "Carex davalliana, commonly known as the Davall\u2019s sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along streambanks. Carex davalliana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting biodiversity."
