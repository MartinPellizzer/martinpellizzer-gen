    "intro": "Ceropegia razafindratsirana, commonly known as the Madagascar moonvine, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the eastern rainforests of Madagascar. It is a climbing plant with thin, wiry stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a unique structure that resembles a moon or crescent shape. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and the plant is adapted to the humid, shaded conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
