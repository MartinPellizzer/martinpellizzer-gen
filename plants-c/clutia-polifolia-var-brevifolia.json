    "intro": "Clutia polifolia var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved clutia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are shorter and broader than those of the typical Clutia polifolia. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often followed by bright red berries. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
