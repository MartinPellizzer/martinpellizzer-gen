    "intro": "Cirsium \u00d7 dominii, commonly known as the hybrid thistle, is a perennial plant native to the British Isles. It is a sterile hybrid between Cirsium vulgare and Cirsium horridulum, resulting in a plant with distinctive, spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its foliage is covered in coarse, bristly hairs, and it produces a tall, erect stem with clustered flower heads. Due to its hybrid nature, it is not found in the wild and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
