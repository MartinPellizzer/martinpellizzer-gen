    "intro": "Carex rariflora var. stygia, commonly known as the rare swamp sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and specialized reproductive structures. The plant typically grows in shallow water or saturated soil, thriving in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss in its moist habitat."
