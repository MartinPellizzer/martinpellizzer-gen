It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often aromatic when crushed, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas or along waterways. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in wetland ecosystems and a potential candidate for phytoremediation."
