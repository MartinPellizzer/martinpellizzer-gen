    "intro": "Cirsium arvense var. horridum, commonly known as rough burdock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a robust, upright stem covered in stiff, prickly hairs, and its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and also covered in dense, bristly hairs. The plant produces purple to pinkish flowers in dense clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its root system is extensive and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in disturbed soils and compete aggressively with other plants. It is often considered a weed in agricultural and garden settings due to its rapid growth and persistence."
