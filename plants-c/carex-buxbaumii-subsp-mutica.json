    "intro": "Carex buxbaumii subsp. mutica, commonly known as the Buxbaum\u2019s sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps prevent soil erosion. The subspecies mutica is distinguished by its shorter, more compact inflorescences compared to the typical form of C. buxbaumii."
