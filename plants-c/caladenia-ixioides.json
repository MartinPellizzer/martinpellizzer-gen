    "intro": "Caladenia ixioides, commonly known as the yellow spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to south-eastern Australia. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands, often in areas with well-drained soil. The plant produces a single, slender stem that bears a single, showy flower with a yellow dorsal sepal and a hooded labellum. Its flowering period occurs during the late winter to early spring, and it is pollinated by small flies. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from land clearing, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
