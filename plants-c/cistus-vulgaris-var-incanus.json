    "intro": "Cistus vulgaris var. incanus, commonly known as the woolly rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silver-gray, fuzzy foliage and clusters of pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and coastal environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The species is also valued for its aromatic properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
