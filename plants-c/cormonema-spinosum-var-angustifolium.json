    "intro": "Cormonema spinosum var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cormonema, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It features a distinctive corm-like stem base, which serves as a storage organ for nutrients. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
