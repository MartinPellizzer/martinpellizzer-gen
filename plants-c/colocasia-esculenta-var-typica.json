    "intro": "Colocasia esculenta var. typica, commonly known as elephant ear, is a tropical perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, often with a deep green color and a velvety texture. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade. It is cultivated for its ornamental value and, in some regions, for its edible corms. The leaves are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
