    "intro": "Calamus crinitus subsp. crinitus, commonly known as the hairy calamus, is a member of the Arecaceae family, characterized by its tall, slender stems and pinnately compound leaves. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Indonesia and the Philippines, where it thrives in wet, tropical environments. The plant is notable for its long, fibrous roots and its ability to grow in swampy or marshy habitats. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and for crafting purposes due to their durability. The flowering stems produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically followed by clusters of bright red berries."
