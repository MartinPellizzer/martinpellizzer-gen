    "intro": "Centrosema carajasense, commonly known as Brazilian straggler vine, is a climbing legume native to the Amazon rainforest. It features trifoliate leaves with small, hairy stipules and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is characterized by its twining habit and is often found in moist, tropical environments. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open to release the seeds. Centrosema carajasense is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agroforestry systems."
