It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silver-tomentose leaves. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that develop into elongated, bristled seed heads. Its subspecies is distinguished by the presence of heterocarps, which are seeds with a different morphology compared to the typical achene. This plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas."
