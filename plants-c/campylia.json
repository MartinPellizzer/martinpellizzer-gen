    "intro": "Campylia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is native to various regions in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its small, often yellow or white flowers and its ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Campylia species are typically shrubs or small trees, with some species reaching heights of up to 10 meters. These plants are valued for their hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used for carving and construction."
