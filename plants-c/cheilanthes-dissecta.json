    "intro": "Cheilanthes dissecta, commonly known as the fringed rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in rocky soils and can often be found growing on limestone or sandstone outcrops. Its rhizomes are typically short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in crevices. Cheilanthes dissecta is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species in its native habitat."
