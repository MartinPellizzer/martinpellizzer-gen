    "intro": "Cereus moniliformis, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems covered in spiny, cylindrical tubercles. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to arid environments. The flowers typically wither by dawn, making it a rare and striking sight in the evening."
