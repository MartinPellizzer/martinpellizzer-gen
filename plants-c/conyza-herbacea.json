    "intro": "Conyza herbacea, commonly known as the common ragweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its branching stems, hairy leaves, and small yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces copious amounts of lightweight pollen, which is a major allergen for many people. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Conyza herbacea is an invasive species in some regions and can compete aggressively with other plants for resources."
