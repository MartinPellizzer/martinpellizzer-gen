    "intro": "Coffea humilis, commonly known as the dwarf coffee plant, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its compact stature and glossy dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries containing the seeds used for coffee. It is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and unique growth habit. However, it is not widely used for commercial coffee production compared to other Coffea species."
