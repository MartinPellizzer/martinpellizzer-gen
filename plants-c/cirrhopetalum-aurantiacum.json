    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum aurantiacum, commonly known as the golden petal orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to yellow flowers, which are often adorned with intricate, wavy patterns. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, thriving in cool, humid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the thin, nutrient-poor soils. The orchid's unique floral structure and striking coloration make it a notable species in botanical studies."
