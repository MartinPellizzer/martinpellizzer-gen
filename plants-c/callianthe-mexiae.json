    "intro": "Callianthe mexiae, commonly known as the Mexican star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of Mexico. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bell-shaped bracts that enclose the actual flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
