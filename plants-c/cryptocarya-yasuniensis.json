    "intro": "Cryptocarya yasuniensis, commonly known as Yasuni cryptocarya, is a species of evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense tropical forests. Its leaves are elliptical with a leathery texture and are often used in traditional medicine by local communities. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat fragmentation, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
