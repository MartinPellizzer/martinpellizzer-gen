    "intro": "Calamus radicalis, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowroot, is a tropical plant belonging to the Zingiberaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are the primary part used, containing starch that can be processed into a starchy flour. Calamus radicalis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in tropical wetlands."
