    "intro": "Cheilanthes pteridioides subsp. acrostica, commonly known as the acrostichous rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to arid and rocky habitats in southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of leathery, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, white tomentum. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
