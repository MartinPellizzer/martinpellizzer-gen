    "intro": "Cycas longisporophylla, commonly known as the long-leaf cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces both male and female cones, with the female cones being particularly distinctive for their elongated, spiky structures. Cycas longisporophylla is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and requires well-drained soil and ample sunlight. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest in botanical research."
