    "intro": "Caryota verschaffeltii, commonly known as the velvet palm, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that are dark green and covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by distinctive, spiky fruit clusters. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
