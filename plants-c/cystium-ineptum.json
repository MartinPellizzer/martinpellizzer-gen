    "intro": "Cystium ineptum, commonly known as the rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, characterized by its woody stems and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cystium ineptum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
