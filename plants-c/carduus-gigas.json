    "intro": "Carduus gigas, commonly known as the giant thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces purple or pink flower heads that consist of numerous small florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a common weed in many regions."
