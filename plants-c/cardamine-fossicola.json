    "intro": "Cardamine fossicola, commonly known as the mossy watercress, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the cool, moist regions of eastern North America. It typically grows in shaded, rocky or wooded areas, often along stream banks or in moist soil. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are usually less than 2 inches in length, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture. Its flowers are small, white or pale green, and clustered in a single umbel, producing tiny, edible seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
