    "intro": "Cytisus hirsutus var. supinus, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant has slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is often found in dry, sunny habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in rocky or sandy environments."
