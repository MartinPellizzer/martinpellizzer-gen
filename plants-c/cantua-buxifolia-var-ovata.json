    "intro": "Cantua buxifolia var. ovata, commonly known as the broadleaf woolly gentian, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, and its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a velvety texture that helps retain moisture in its natural habitat. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and shady borders due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
