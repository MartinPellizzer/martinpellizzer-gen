    "intro": "Cepobaculum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that resemble the appearance of ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its unique botanical features include a short, thick stem and small, clustered leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, Cepobaculum is considered a rare and highly sought-after specimen in botanical studies."
