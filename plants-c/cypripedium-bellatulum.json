    "intro": "Cypripedium bellatulum, commonly known as the showy lady's slipper, is a rare and endangered orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy pink or white pouch-shaped flower, which resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and requires specific soil conditions to thrive. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is critically endangered and protected in many regions."
