    "intro": "Clerodendrum cauliflorum, commonly known as the tropical hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often appear in clusters, typically in a cauliflorous pattern, meaning they grow directly from the trunk or branches. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves that are often velvety to the touch. Its flowers are usually bright red or orange, with five petals and a prominent central column. Clerodendrum cauliflorum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
