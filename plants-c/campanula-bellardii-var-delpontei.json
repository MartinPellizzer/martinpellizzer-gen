    "intro": "Campanula bellardii var. delpontei, commonly known as the Delpontei bell bellflower, is a rare and striking member of the Campanulaceae family. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, sky-blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. Native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, this plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral structure, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
