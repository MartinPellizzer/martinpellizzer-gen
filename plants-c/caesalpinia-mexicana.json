    "intro": "Caesalpinia mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican glorybower, is a shrub or small tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, feather-like leaves and bright yellow flowers. The plant produces long, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Caesalpinia mexicana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
