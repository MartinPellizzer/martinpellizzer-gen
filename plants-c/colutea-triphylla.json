    "intro": "Colutea triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaved hogweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a distinctive manner. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the Papaveraceae family. Its roots contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine, though it is considered toxic in high doses. Colutea triphylla thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
