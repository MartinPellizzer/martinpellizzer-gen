    "intro": "Cyathea aquilina, commonly known as the mountain huperzia, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizome system allows it to anchor firmly in the soil while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding environment. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and horticulture due to their aesthetic appeal and potential medicinal properties."
