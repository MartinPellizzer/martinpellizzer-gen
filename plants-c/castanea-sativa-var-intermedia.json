    "intro": "Castanea sativa var. intermedia, commonly known as the Spanish chestnut, is a hybrid species that arises from the cross between the sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa) and the Chinese chestnut (Castanea mollisima). It is characterized by its medium-sized, edible nuts that are less bitter than those of the sweet chestnut. The plant is typically deciduous, with palmate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and nut production. This variety is also valued for its resistance to certain diseases that affect other chestnut species."
