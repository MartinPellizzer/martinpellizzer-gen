The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Cleyera theoides is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to provide year-round interest in the landscape."
