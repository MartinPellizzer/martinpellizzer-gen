It features small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has rounded, hairy leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
