    "intro": "Chamaebuxus alpestris var. rhodoptera, commonly known as the red-flowered alpine bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, with the varietal name \"rhodoptera\" referring to its reddish tinge. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh conditions."
