It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist or wetland environments. Cordylestylis species are usually herbaceous, with a rhizomatous or stolonic growth habit. These plants play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in their native ecosystems."
