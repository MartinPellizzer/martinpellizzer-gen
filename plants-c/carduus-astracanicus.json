    "intro": "Carduus astracanicus, commonly known as the Astracan thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features a robust, upright stem covered in stiff, spiny hairs, and its leaves are deeply lobed with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces yellow composite flowers in late summer, which are composed of many tiny florets arranged in a circular pattern. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in steppe and grassland habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
