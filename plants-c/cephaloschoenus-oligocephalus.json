    "intro": "Cephaloschoenus oligocephalus, commonly known as the narrow-headed waterwheel, is a perennial aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clusters at the water's surface. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often in marshes and ponds. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is an important species in wetland ecosystems."
