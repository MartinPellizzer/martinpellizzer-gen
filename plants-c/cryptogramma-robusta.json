    "intro": "Cryptogramma robusta, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and is often found in rocky or crevice habitats. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its dark green, leathery fronds that are usually covered in a fine layer of trichomes. Its spores are released from the sori, which are located on the undersides of the fronds. Cryptogramma robusta is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and resilient species."
