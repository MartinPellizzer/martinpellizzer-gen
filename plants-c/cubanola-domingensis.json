It belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by dark blue, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
