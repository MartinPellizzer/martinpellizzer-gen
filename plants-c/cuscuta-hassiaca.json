    "intro": "Cuscuta hassiaca, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host to extract water and nutrients. The plant is native to parts of Africa and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through mechanical means, allowing it to spread to new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and native vegetation."
