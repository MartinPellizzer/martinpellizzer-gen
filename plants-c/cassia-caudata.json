    "intro": "Cassia caudata, commonly known as the weeping cassia, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping inflorescences that resemble curtains of yellow flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into multiple pairs of leaflets. Cassia caudata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
