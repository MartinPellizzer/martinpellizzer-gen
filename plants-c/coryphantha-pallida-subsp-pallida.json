    "intro": "Coryphantha pallida subsp. pallida, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its pale green stems. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The subspecies is notable for its delicate appearance and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
