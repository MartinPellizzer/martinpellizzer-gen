It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red, tubular flowers that resemble paintbrushes. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on host plants for water and nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. Its unique floral structure and parasitic nature make it an important component of its ecological community."
