    "intro": "Centaurea ammophila, commonly known as the sand centaury, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its erect, spindly growth habit and produces vibrant blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in sandy and saline soils, making it well adapted to coastal dunes. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Centaurea ammophila plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local wildlife."
