    "intro": "Cyperus bipartitus f. elongatus, commonly known as the elongated flatsedge, is a variant of the flatsedge genus characterized by its distinctive elongated leaf blades. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions, typically found in wetland or marshy habitats. The plant features a rhizomatous root system, which allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist soils. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spike-like flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. The leaves are usually flat, narrow, and have a smooth surface, contributing to its ornamental appeal in aquatic or semi-aquatic gardens."
