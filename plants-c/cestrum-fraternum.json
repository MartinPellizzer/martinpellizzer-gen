    "intro": "Cestrum fraternum, commonly known as the night-flowering trumpet honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that open in the evening and emit a strong, sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Cestrum fraternum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and nocturnal bloom, making it a unique addition to gardens and landscapes."
