It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant produces woody pods that contain seeds, and it is often found in moist, shaded habitats. Cola talbotii is related to the cola nuts used in beverages, but it is less commonly cultivated for commercial purposes. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and conservation efforts."
