It features trifoliate leaves with slender, lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers clustered in racemes. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that help it ascend supports. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. This species is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
