    "intro": "Chrysosplenium sphaerospermum var. fulvum, commonly known as the golden sphaerosperm, is a rare and diminutive flowering plant native to specific regions of Asia. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and delicate, yellowish-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its leaves are often rounded and have a glossy texture, while its flowers are short-lived but attract various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
