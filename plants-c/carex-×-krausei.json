    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 krausei, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Carex divulsa and Carex scabrata, both of which are native to North America. The plant typically forms dense clumps of grass-like foliage with narrow, grassy leaves that are usually dark green in color. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Carex \u00d7 krausei is often found in moist to wet habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks."
