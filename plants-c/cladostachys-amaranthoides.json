    "intro": "Cladostachys amaranthoides, commonly known as the red amaranth, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils make it a common weed in agricultural fields and disturbed areas. Cladostachys amaranthoides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
