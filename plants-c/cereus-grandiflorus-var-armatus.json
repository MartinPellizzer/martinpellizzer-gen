    "intro": "Cereus grandiflorus var. armatus, commonly known as the armed night bloomer, is a cactus species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and spiny, cylindrical stems that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique morphology and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and succulent collections."
