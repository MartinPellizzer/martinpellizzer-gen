    "intro": "Calandrinia chamissoi, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, featuring succulent leaves and a deep root system for water conservation. Its blooming period typically occurs in the early morning, hence its common name, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators.
