    "intro": "Coreopsis foetida, commonly known as stinking coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in open woods and along roadsides. The plant's name refers to its strong, unpleasant odor, which is more noticeable when the flowers are in bloom."
