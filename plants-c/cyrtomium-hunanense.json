    "intro": "Cyrtomium hunanense, commonly known as the Hunan water fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, glossy, dark green fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Cyrtomium hunanense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, fern-like appearance."
