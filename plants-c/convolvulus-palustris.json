    "intro": "Convolvulus palustris, commonly known as marsh bindweed, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist soils. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in areas with consistent moisture. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in some regions, though it also serves as a food source for various insects and birds."
