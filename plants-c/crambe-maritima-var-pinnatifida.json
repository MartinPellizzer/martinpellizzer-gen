    "intro": "Crambe maritima var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the sea kale, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in saline or brackish soils along shorelines. The plant features a rosette of fleshy, lobed leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and tidal conditions. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a raceme, and bloom in late summer. The variety pinnatifida is distinguished by its finely divided, pinnate leaves, which enhance its ability to capture sunlight in its often harsh coastal habitat."
