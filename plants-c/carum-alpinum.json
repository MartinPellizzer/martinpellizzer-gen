It belongs to the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its small, white or greenish flowers and feathery leaves. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its seeds are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to caraway. Carum alpinum plays an important ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining alpine biodiversity."
