It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are similar in appearance to starfruit, though they are not typically eaten by humans. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. The tree is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
