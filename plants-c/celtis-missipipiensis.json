    "intro": "Celtis missipipiensis, commonly known as the American winged elm, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Elaeocarpaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by winged fruits, which are dispersed by wind. It is often found in moist bottomlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in rich, well-drained soils. Celtis missipipiensis is valued for its adaptability and historical use in traditional medicine."
