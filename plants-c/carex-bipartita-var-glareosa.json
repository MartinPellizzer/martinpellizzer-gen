It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it produces distinctive, three-sided capsules that contain its seeds.
