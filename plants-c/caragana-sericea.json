    "intro": "Caragana sericea, commonly known as silky caragana, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, compound leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, followed by elongated pods that contain several seeds. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and steppe environments. Silky caragana is valued for its hardiness and is used in erosion control and ornamental gardening."
