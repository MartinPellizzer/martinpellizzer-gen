    "intro": "Coleus celsus, commonly known as the wax plant, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its striking, colorful foliage rather than its small, inconspicuous flowers. The leaves are often brightly colored, ranging from red, orange, and yellow to purple and green, making it a popular ornamental plant. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The plant is also valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
