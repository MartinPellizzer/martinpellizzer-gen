    "intro": "Calamagrostis austrodensa, commonly known as the eastern false panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate floral display. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
