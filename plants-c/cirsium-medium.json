    "intro": "Cirsium medium, commonly known as the common thistle, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs and have a rough, prickly texture, while its flowers are arranged in a dense, spherical cluster. Cirsium medium is often used in traditional medicine and is also a host plant for certain butterfly species."
