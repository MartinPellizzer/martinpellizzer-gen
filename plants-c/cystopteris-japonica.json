    "intro": "Cystopteris japonica, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often found in shallow, freshwater environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread across the water surface. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a finely toothed margin that aids in water retention. Cystopteris japonica plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
