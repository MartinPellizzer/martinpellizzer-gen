It is characterized by its profuse flowering, with multiple clusters of white or pale pink flowers appearing on the same branch. The plant is native to Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than its fruit. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for garden landscapes and botanical collections."
