    "intro": "Campanula cespitosa f. simplex, commonly known as the simple bellflower, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to violet in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
