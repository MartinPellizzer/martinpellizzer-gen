    "intro": "Cuscutina, commonly known as dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow or white flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant's seeds are often dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, allowing it to colonize new hosts easily. Dodder can infest a wide range of crops and ornamental plants, causing significant agricultural damage. Its unique life cycle and lack of independent photosynthesis make it an intriguing subject in botanical studies."
