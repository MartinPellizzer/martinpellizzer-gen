    "intro": "Crucianella insignis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in the summer. Its flowers are clustered in spike-like inflorescences and are pollinated by insects. Crucianella insignis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
