    "intro": "Cenia anthemoidea, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warm seasons. Cenia anthemoidea is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful plant in certain agricultural contexts and a potential weed in cultivated areas."
