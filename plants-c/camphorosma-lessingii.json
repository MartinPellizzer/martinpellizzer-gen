    "intro": "Camphorosma lessingii, commonly known as the lesser camphor tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves that emit a strong, camphor-like scent. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by round, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but generally not for humans. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from underground sources. Camphorosma lessingii plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
