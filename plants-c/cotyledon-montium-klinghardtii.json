    "intro": "Cotyledon montium-klinghardtii, commonly known as the Frost Cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the growing season. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot."
