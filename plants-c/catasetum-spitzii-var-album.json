This variant is characterized by its striking white flowers, which contrast with its green foliage, making it a visually appealing ornamental plant. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. The plant produces specialized structures called \"labellum\" that aid in pollination by certain species of bees. It is valued for its beauty and is cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and ease of care."
