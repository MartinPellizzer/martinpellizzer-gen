    "intro": "Crocus biflorus var. artvinensis, commonly known as the Artvin crocus, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with a yellow center, which bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils, preferring cool and moist environments. Its bulbs are small and adapted to survive harsh alpine conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
