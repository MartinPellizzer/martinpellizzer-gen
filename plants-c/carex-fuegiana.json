It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as meadows and wetlands. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while its inflorescence consists of spikelets that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex fuegiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
