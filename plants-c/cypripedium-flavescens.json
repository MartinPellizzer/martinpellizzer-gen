    "intro": "Cypripedium flavescens, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper, is a striking orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow pouch-shaped flower, which is adapted to attract specific pollinators. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces showy, fragrant blooms in late spring. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species in many regions."
