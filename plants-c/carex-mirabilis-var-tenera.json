    "intro": "Carex mirabilis var. tenera, commonly known as the velvetleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the sedge family. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective ground cover in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
