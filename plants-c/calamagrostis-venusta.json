    "intro": "Calamagrostis venusta, commonly known as the silver feather reed grass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and feathery, silver-gray plumes that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a soft, silky texture. Calamagrostis venusta is valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
