    "intro": "Crepidopteris, commonly known as the sword fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, sword-shaped leaves that are often glossy and upright. The plants typically have a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing them to spread and form dense clumps. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in wetlands and marshy areas. Crepidopteris species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist environments."
