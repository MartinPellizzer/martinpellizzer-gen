    "intro": "Crataegus pycnoloba var. parnassica, commonly known as the Parnassian hawthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its fruits are small, red berries that ripen in late summer and are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. This species is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine environments."
