    "intro": "Cecropia paraensis, commonly known as the Amazonian ceiba, is a tall, fast-growing tree native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its buttressed roots and large, palmate leaves. The plant has a unique symbiotic relationship with Azteca ants, which live in the hollow stems and provide protection against herbivores. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing white or pale yellow petals, and it relies on insects for pollination. The tree is also notable for its rapid growth rate, making it an important component of the rainforest ecosystem."
