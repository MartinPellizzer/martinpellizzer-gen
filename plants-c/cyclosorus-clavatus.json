    "intro": "Cyclosorus clavatus, commonly known as the club-moss, is a small, evergreen fern that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, club-shaped spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically found at the tips of its leaf-like shoots. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in dense mats on forest floors or rocky substrates. Its leaves are narrow and arranged spirally around the stem, contributing to its compact, moss-like appearance. Cyclosorus clavatus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
