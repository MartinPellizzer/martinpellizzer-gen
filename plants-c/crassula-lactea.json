    "intro": "Crassula lactea, commonly known as the milk plant or moonshine plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. Its leaves are slightly hairy and have a milky sap, which gives it its common name. Crassula lactea is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
