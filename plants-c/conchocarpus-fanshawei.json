    "intro": "Conchocarpus fanshawei, commonly known as the Fan's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling a fan-like structure. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky coastal soils and is adapted to saline environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Conchocarpus fanshawei plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small marine and terrestrial organisms."
