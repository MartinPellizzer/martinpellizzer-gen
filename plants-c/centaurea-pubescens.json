    "intro": "Centaurea pubescens, commonly known as the hairy centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations to its arid environment, helping to reduce water loss. The flowers, which range in color from pink to red, attract various pollinators including bees and butterflies."
