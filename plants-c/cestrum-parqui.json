It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet, featuring opposite, simple, and ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its flowers are followed by small, orange-red berries that contain the seeds. Cestrum parqui is often cultivated for its ornamental value and pleasant fragrance."
