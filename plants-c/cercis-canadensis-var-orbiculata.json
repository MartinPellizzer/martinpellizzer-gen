    "intro": "Cercis canadensis var. orbiculata, commonly known as the Eastern red cedar or, more specifically, the orbiculate maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its rounded, orbicular leaves that are typically 3\u20136 inches in diameter, with a smooth, glossy surface and a serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, red or pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. Its root system is shallow and fibrous, making it adaptable to a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions. The foliage turns a striking red or orange in the fall, adding ornamental value to the landscape."
