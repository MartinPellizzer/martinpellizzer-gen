    "intro": "Cajanus indicus var. bicolor, commonly known as the pink pigeon pea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive pink and white bi-colored flowers, which bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated pods containing edible seeds that are rich in protein and often used in culinary applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for cultivation in arid climates. Additionally, it plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
