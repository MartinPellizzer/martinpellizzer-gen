    "intro": "Cenchrus pycnostachyus, commonly known as the dense-stamen grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are typically arranged in two rows along the stem. Its inflorescence consists of slender, spike-like structures that bear small, two-lobed florets. Cenchrus pycnostachyus is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to dry, open habitats."
