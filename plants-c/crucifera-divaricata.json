    "intro": "Crucifera divaricata, commonly known as the spreading mustard, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, alternate leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typical of the cruciferous family, which are followed by small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various conditions, it is considered a common weed in agricultural and natural settings."
