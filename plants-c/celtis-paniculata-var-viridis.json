    "intro": "Celtis paniculata var. viridis, commonly known as the green-leafed hackberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and its leaves are ovate to elliptical with a pointed tip. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in pendulous clusters, followed by spherical, green berries that turn red when mature. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in moist to mesic habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological studies and ornamental horticulture."
