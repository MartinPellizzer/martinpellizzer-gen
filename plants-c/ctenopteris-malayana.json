    "intro": "Ctenopteris malayana, commonly known as the Malayan water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its rhizomes are often submerged in water, which helps in nutrient absorption. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that give it a distinctive appearance."
