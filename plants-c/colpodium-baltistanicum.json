    "intro": "Colpodium baltistanicum, commonly known as the Baltistan cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Kashmir Himalayas. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible or medicinal properties. The plant forms dense cushions of foliage, which helps it survive in cold, arid environments. Its leaves are typically small, thick, and covered in a fine layer of hairs to reduce water loss. Colpodium baltistanicum is adapted to rocky and alpine habitats, often found at elevations above 3,000 meters."
