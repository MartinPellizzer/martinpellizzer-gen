    "intro": "Cereus horridus var. alatosquamatus, commonly known as the hairy scabious cactus, is a species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are often covered with short, hair-like structures. The plant produces large, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is valued for its unique appearance and adaptability to harsh desert conditions."
