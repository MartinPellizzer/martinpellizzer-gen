    "intro": "Cardamomum biflorum, commonly known as the two-flower cardamom, is a perennial herb native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features erect, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are aromatic and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its seeds, enclosed in a dark, three-lobed pod, are prized for their intense flavor and aromatic properties. Cardamomum biflorum is often cultivated for both its ornamental value and its use in traditional medicine and culinary applications."
