    "intro": "Cotyledon buchholziana, commonly known as the Ghost Plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Cotyledon buchholziana is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
