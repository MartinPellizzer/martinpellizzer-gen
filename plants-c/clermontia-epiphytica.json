    "intro": "Clermontia epiphytica, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 silversword, is a rare endemic plant native to Hawaii. It is an epiphytic shrub, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom once every few years. Due to its limited range and habitat threats, it is classified as endangered."
