    "intro": "Conyza racemosa, commonly known as Hoary weed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its grayish-white, hairy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in new environments. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it adaptable to a wide range of ecological conditions."
