    "intro": "Caralluma europaea var. albotigrina, commonly known as the white-tiger caralluma, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Europe. It features spiny, cylindrical stems covered in white, waxy tubercles that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it a notable species in xerophytic ecosystems."
