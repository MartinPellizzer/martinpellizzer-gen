It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, cylindrical leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish to brownish flowers, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.
