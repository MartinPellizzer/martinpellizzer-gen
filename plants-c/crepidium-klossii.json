    "intro": "Crepidium klossii, commonly known as the Kloss's orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Indonesia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and green, often with a distinctive lip that is adorned with intricate patterns. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
