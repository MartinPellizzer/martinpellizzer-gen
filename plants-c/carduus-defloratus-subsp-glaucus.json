    "intro": "Carduus defloratus subsp. glaucus, commonly known as the glaucous thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, silvery-green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces purple to pinkish flowers in a single, terminal head, which are surrounded by bracts. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and sometimes invasive species in its native and introduced ranges."
