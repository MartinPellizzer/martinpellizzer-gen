    "intro": "Cistus \u00d7 pulverulentus, commonly known as the dusty rock rose, is a hybrid shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for Mediterranean climates. Its aromatic leaves release a resinous scent when crushed, a feature common among many Cistus species. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
