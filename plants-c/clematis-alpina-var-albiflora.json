    "intro": "Clematis alpina var. albiflora, commonly known as the alpine white clematis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a deciduous vine characterized by its slender stems and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant prefers well-drained, alkaline soils and full sun to partial shade, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Its foliage is typically green and slightly hairy, and it produces feathery, palmate leaves. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
