    "intro": "Cuphea cristata, commonly known as the hooded cuphea, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its striking, hood-like bracts that encase the small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 feet, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. It produces vibrant red or pink flowers that bloom throughout the summer months. Cuphea cristata is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees."
