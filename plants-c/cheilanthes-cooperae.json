    "intro": "Cheilanthes cooperae, commonly known as the Cooper's rockcap, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant that typically grows on rock surfaces or tree trunks in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth form with thick, leathery fronds that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and the plant is often found in regions with limestone or granite substrates. Cheilanthes cooperae is well adapted to harsh climates and is a common sight in rocky habitats across its native range."
