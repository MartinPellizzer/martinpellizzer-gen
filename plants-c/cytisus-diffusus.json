    "intro": "Cytisus diffusus, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe. It features wiry, sprawling stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators like bees. Its leaves are small, leathery, and trifoliate, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Cytisus diffusus is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in harsh environments."
