    "intro": "Coelogyne occultata, commonly known as the hidden coelogyne, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink, often with a distinctive red or purple lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps it retain moisture. Coelogyne occultata is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements in cultivation."
