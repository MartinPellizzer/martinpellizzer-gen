    "intro": "Coussarea graciliflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered coussarea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically odd-pinnate with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, arranged in racemose inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Coussarea graciliflora is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth."
