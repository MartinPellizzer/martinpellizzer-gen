    "intro": "Cryptotaenia flahaultii, commonly known as the Flahault's angelica, is a rare and endangered species native to Japan. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in mountainous regions. Its botanical features include aromatic foliage and small white flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
