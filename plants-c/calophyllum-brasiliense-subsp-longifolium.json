    "intro": "Calophyllum brasiliense subsp. longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved calophyllum, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in whorls at the ends of branches. The tree produces yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, orange-red fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
