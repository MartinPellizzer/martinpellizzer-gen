It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night, emitting a strong, sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its arid environment. Its flowers are composed of two large, overlapping petals and a central, tubular structure. Calea gargantae is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
