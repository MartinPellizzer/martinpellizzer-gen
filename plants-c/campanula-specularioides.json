    "intro": "Campanula specularioides, commonly known as the silver carpet bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with silvery-gray leaves that reflect light, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
