    "intro": "Cyperus noeanus, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically found in dense clusters at the base of the plant. Cyperus noeanus thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
