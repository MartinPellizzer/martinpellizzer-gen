    "intro": "Cyclantheropsis, commonly known as the small-leafed cucumber vine, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cucurbitaceae. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with slender stems that often twine around supports. The leaves are typically small, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture. The flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, a feature common in the Cucurbitaceae family. Cyclantheropsis species are native to tropical regions of South America and are often found in humid, shaded environments."
