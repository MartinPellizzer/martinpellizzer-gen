    "intro": "Codonopsis nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal, India, and Bhutan. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters. Its leaves are lanceolate, hairy, and arranged alternately along the stem. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds."
