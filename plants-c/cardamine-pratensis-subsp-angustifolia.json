    "intro": "Cardamine pratensis subsp. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist meadows and stream sides in Europe. It features slender, upright stems and trifoliate leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in terminal racemes. Its roots are fibrous, and it thrives in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils. This subspecies is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor."
