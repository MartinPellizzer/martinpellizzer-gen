    "intro": "Crepis pantocsekii, commonly known as the Pantocsek's mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the Carpathian Mountains in Central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers and hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to mountainous environments. It has narrow, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are usually pale yellow to white in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
