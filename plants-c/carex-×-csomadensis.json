    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 csomadensis, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Carex bulbosa and Carex crocata, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. Its grass-like foliage consists of narrow, grass-green leaves, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. While it is not widely cultivated, it is occasionally found in horticultural collections due to its ornamental value."
