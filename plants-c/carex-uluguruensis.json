    "intro": "Carex uluguruensis, commonly known as the Uluguru sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to the Uluguru Mountains in Tanzania, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and spikelets that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Due to its restricted distribution, Carex uluguruensis is considered a rare and potentially vulnerable species."
