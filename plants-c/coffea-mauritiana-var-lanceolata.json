    "intro": "Coffea mauritiana var. lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed Mauritius coffee, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its lanceolate leaves, which are elongated and pointed, and its small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces red, fleshy berries containing two seeds, which are used to make coffee. It is a wild relative of the coffee plant and is valued for its genetic diversity. Due to its ornamental qualities and potential for breeding programs, it is also cultivated in some horticultural settings."
