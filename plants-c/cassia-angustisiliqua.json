    "intro": "Cassia angustisiliqua, commonly known as sickle cassia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its narrow, sickle-shaped leaves. The plant produces bright yellow, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are encased in long, slender pods and are often used in traditional medicine. Cassia angustisiliqua is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic qualities in gardens."
