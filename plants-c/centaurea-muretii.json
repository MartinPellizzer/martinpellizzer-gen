    "intro": "Centaurea muretii, commonly known as the rock centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in dry, sunny environments. Its small blue to purple flowers bloom in summer, and it produces bristly, spiny seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. Centaurea muretii is often used in ornamental gardening due to its hardy nature and visual appeal."
