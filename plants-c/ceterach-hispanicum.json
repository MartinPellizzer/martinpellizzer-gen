It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant features dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white\u8338\u6bdb, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas with a Mediterranean climate. Ceterach hispanicum is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species."
