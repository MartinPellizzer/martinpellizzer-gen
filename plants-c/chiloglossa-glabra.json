    "intro": "Chiloglossa glabra, commonly known as the smooth-tongued plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features smooth, lanceolate leaves and small, white to greenish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its root system is fibrous, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
