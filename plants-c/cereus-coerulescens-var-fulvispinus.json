    "intro": "Cereus coerulescens var. fulvispinus, commonly known as the golden spines cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in yellow spines, giving it its common name. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, a trait typical of many cacti in the night-blooming group. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. The varietal name 'fulvispinus' refers to its distinctive golden-colored spines."
