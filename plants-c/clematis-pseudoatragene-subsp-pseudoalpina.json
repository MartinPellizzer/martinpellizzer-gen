    "intro": "Clematis pseudoatragene subsp. pseudoalpina, commonly known as the alpine clematis, is a perennial climbing vine native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
