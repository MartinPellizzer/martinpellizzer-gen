    "intro": "Centaurea scabiosa var. dumetorum, commonly known as mouse-eared chickweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy leaves and small, spiky blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has a taproot system and produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but also has historical uses in traditional medicine."
