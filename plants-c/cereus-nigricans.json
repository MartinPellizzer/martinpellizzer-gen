    "intro": "Cereus nigricans, commonly known as the black nightshade cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a tall, columnar cactus with a spiny, ribbed stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking, large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in desert conditions. The plant is also known for its ability to tolerate extreme temperatures and poor soil conditions."
