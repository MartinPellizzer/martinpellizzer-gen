    "intro": "Cyperus erectus var. erectus, commonly known as the upright flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as pond margins and flooded soils. Its flowering spikes are usually clustered at the base of the plant, producing small, inconspicuous flowers. Cyperus erectus var. erectus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
