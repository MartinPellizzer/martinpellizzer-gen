It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers, which can be single or double, and their palmate or lobed leaves. Cruzeta species typically have rough, hairy stems and produce capsules as fruits. They are often used in ornamental gardening due to their attractive blooms and adaptability to various soil types."
