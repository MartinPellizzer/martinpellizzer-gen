    "intro": "Caladenia gracilis, commonly known as the slender spider-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in heathlands and open forests. The plant features a single, slender stem with a single, elongated flower that is usually pale yellow or greenish-white. Its flowers have a distinctive spider-like appearance, with narrow petals and a spurred lip. Caladenia gracilis is a protected species due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss."
