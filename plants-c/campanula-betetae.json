    "intro": "Campanula betetae, commonly known as the Beteta's bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy blue to violet bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Campanula betetae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, bell-like blooms."
