    "intro": "Coryphantha calipensis, commonly known as the California hedgehog cactus, is a species of flowering plant in the Cactaceae family. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spiny areoles, which support clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. It produces fruits that are typically red or orange, containing seeds dispersed by animals. Due to its unique adaptations, it is well-suited for xeriscaping and is often cultivated in desert gardens."
