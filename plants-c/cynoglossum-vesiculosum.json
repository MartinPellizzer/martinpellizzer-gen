    "intro": "Cynoglossum vesiculosum, commonly known as bladder campion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive blue to violet flowers and hairy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and can be found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Its scientific name refers to the bladder-like structures on its stems, which are swollen and contain air cavities. Bladder campion is often used in herbal medicine and is also a popular ornamental plant in gardens."
