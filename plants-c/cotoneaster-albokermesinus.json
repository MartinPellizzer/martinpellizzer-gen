    "intro": "Cotoneaster albokermesinus, commonly known as the white-flowered cotoneaster, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to China and is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red berries that are edible for birds but generally unpalatable to humans. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms. Cotoneaster albokermesinus is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils."
