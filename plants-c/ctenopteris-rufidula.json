    "intro": "Ctenopteris rufidula, commonly known as the red-veined fern, is a tropical species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fronds that have a distinctive reddish coloration along the veins, which becomes more pronounced as the plant matures. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a feathery appearance, and they grow in a compact, bushy form. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist forests or along stream banks. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in indoor settings with proper care."
