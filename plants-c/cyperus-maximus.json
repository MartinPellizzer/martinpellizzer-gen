    "intro": "Cyperus maximus, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a tall, grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with whorled, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Cyperus maximus is valued for its ornamental appearance and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic habitats."
