    "intro": "Copisma glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular copisma, is a flowering plant native to parts of North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Its leaves are usually glandular-dotted, giving the plant its common name, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Copisma glandulosum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
