    "intro": "Caballeria coriacea, commonly known as the rough caballero, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a rough, textured surface, giving it its scientific name \"coriacea,\" which means \"woody\" or \"rough\" in Latin. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
