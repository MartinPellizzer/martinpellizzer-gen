    "intro": "Callitriche pallens var. cespitosa, commonly known as the marshweed or water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to wetlands and slow-moving water bodies. It typically grows in dense clusters, forming mats on the surface of water or along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, opposite leaves that are oval to lance-shaped. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, often floating on the water's surface. It plays a role in stabilizing aquatic environments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
