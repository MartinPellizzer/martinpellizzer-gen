    "intro": "Clematis alsomitrifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It features slender, twining stems that can reach lengths of up to 15 feet, allowing it to climb trees and other structures. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of three to five oval-shaped leaflets, and are arranged alternately along the stems. Clematis alsomitrifolia thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, moist soil."
