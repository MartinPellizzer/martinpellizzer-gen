    "intro": "Cystopteris fragilis var. lobatodentata, commonly known as the fragrant water fern, is a delicate fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are often covered in a powdery, waxy coating. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteridaceae family. This variety is distinguished by its lobed, toothed leaflets, which give it a more intricate appearance compared to other members of the species."
