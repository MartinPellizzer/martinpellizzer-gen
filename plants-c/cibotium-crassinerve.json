    "intro": "Cibotium crassinerve, commonly known as the broad-nerve tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive, fibrous root system that helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of its fronds. Cibotium crassinerve plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
