    "intro": "Cypripedium spicerianum, commonly known as the Chinese lily or the yellow lady's slipper, is a perennial orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow pouch-shaped lip, which is a key feature in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often in rich, humus-filled soil. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing showy, fragrant flowers that attract specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
