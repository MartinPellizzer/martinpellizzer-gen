It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a compact growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a decorative hedge. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
