    "intro": "Carissa edulis, commonly known as the Natal plum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, orange-red fruits that are edible when ripe, though they are often too sour for direct consumption. Carissa edulis thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive appearance and ability to attract birds and insects."
