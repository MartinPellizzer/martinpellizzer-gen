    "intro": "Cereus decandollei, commonly known as the Decandolle's night bloomer, is a cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and is typically found growing in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces striking white flowers at night, which open briefly before closing by dawn. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Its unique nocturnal blooming habit makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
