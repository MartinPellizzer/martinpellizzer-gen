    "intro": "Cyathea cervantesiana, commonly known as the Cervantes's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting its upright structure and aiding in water absorption. Cyathea cervantesiana plays a significant role in the ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability in its native habitat."
