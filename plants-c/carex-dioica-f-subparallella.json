    "intro": "Carex dioica f. subparallella, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedges, is a variant of the common sedge. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are often parallel-veined, giving it a distinctive appearance. This plant typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It is a perennial herb that produces small, spike-like inflorescences with both male and female flowers. The subspecies subparallella is notable for its subtle leaf morphology, which sets it apart from other forms of Carex dioica."
