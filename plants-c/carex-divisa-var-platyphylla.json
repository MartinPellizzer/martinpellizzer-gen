    "intro": "Carex divisa var. platyphylla, commonly known as the broadleaf sedge, is a perennial plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves that are broader and more robust compared to typical sedges, with a distinct blade-like structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for water garden landscapes."
