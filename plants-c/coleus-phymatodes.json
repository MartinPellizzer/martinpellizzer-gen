    "intro": "Coleus phymatodes, commonly known as the Texas starshade, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its striking, bi-color leaves that often display shades of red, white, and green. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale purple or white, arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
