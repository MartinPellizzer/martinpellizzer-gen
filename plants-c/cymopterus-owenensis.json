    "intro": "Cymopterus owenensis, commonly known as Owen's eveningflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, cylindrical seed heads that mature in the fall. Owen's eveningflower is often found in sagebrush steppe and other semi-arid habitats."
