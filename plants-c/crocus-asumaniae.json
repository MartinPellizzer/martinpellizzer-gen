    "intro": "Crocus asumaniae, commonly known as the Asu Mountains crocus, is a species of flowering plant in the iris family, Iridaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Asu Mountains in Ethiopia, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces delicate, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in early spring. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a corm, a type of underground storage organ. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
