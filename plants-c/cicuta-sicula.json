    "intro": "Cicuta sicula, commonly known as the Sicilian water hemlock, is a toxic member of the Apiaceae family. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. Native to the Mediterranean region, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and wetlands. The plant contains potent toxins, including cicutoxin, which can be lethal to humans and animals. Due to its high toxicity, it is often avoided in horticulture and requires caution during identification and handling."
