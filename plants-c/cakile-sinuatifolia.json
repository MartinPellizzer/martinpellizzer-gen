    "intro": "Cakile sinuatifolia, commonly known as the sinuate sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing annual herb with a taproot system adapted to survive in sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are characterized by their deeply sinuate margins. It thrives in environments with limited water availability, making it a common species in desert and coastal dune ecosystems. Cakile sinuatifolia plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
