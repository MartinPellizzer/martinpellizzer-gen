    "intro": "Cacalia ammophila, commonly known as the sand dune bellflower, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found growing on dunes and coastal cliffs. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Cacalia ammophila plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
