It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a rough texture. The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
