    "intro": "Carex verna var. pedunculata, commonly known as the early sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in shaded to partially shaded environments, such as woodlands and wetlands. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of greenish or brownish flowers in early spring. It is often found in association with other early successional plants in forested areas. The variety pedunculata is distinguished by its elongated flower stalks, which elevate the inflorescence above the foliage."
