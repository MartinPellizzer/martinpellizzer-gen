    "intro": "Carex rigidioides, commonly known as rigid false sweetflag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in a cylindrical inflorescence. Carex rigidioides is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
