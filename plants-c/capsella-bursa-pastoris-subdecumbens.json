    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris subdecumbens, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to temperate regions. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are typically oval with a slightly hairy texture. The plant has a taproot system and produces small, triangular seed pods that release tiny seeds when mature. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed but also a subject of study in ecology and botany."
