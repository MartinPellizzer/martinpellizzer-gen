    "intro": "Campanula balcanica f. incerta, commonly known as the uncertain Balkan bellflower, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the Campanula genus. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to the Balkan region and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. It is a perennial herb with slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically interesting but endangered species."
