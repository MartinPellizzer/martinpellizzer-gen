    "intro": "Calanthe leucosceptrum var. bisubulifera, commonly known as the white-lipped calanthe, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features elegant, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many areas."
