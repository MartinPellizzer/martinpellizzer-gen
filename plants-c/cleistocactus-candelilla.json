    "intro": "Cleistocactus candelilla, commonly known as the candle bush, is a flowering cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico and the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that resemble candles, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green, ribbed structure. It is well adapted to hot, dry environments and has a slow growth rate. Cleistocactus candelilla is also valued for its historical use in traditional practices and as a source of natural wax."
