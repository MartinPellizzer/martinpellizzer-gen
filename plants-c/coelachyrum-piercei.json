    "intro": "Coelachyrum piercei, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Coelachyrum piercei is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is an important component of desert ecosystems."
