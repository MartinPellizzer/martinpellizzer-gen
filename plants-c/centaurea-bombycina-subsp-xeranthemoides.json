It is characterized by its dense, fluffy purple or pink flower heads, which are surrounded by bracts that give it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. This subspecies is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
