    "intro": "Cyclosorus parvifolius, commonly known as the small-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that often form a rosette shape, and it typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its floating leaves that are often divided into four lobes, resembling a four-leaf clover. It is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and is often found in ponds, ditches, and wetlands. Cyclosorus parvifolius plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through its filtration capabilities."
