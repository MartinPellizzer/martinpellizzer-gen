    "intro": "Cyathula madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is typical of the genus Cyathula. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
