    "intro": "Couepia nutans, commonly known as the drooping couepia, is a flowering plant species native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with palmate leaves that are often lobed. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds, and it thrives in humid, well-drained soils. Couepia nutans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
