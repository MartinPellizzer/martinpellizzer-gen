    "intro": "Caesalpinia chicamana, commonly known as the Chichimeca legume, is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its nitrogen-fixing capabilities through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces bright yellow or orange flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. Its fruit is a long, slender pod that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems. Caesalpinia chicamana is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential ecological benefits."
