    "intro": "Costia imbricata, commonly known as the wrinkled water fern, is a small aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features delicate, ribbon-like leaves that are often curled or folded, giving it a unique appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures are inconspicuous, relying primarily on vegetative propagation for spread. Costia imbricata plays a minor role in aquatic ecosystems but is valued in ornamental gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
