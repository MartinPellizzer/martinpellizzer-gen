It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are covered in a rough, sandpapery texture. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in racemes along the stems.

The plant is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
