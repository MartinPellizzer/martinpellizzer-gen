    "intro": "Cliffortia cruciata, commonly known as the cross-leaved sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
