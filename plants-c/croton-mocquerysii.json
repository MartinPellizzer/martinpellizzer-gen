It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from green to reddish hues. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant in warmer regions."
