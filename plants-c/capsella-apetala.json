    "intro": "Capsella apetala, commonly known as the mouse-ear or mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is an annual or biennial herb with small, inconspicuous flowers that lack petals, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, round, greenish-brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. It typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
