It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils, often found in marshy areas or along water bodies. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, three-ranked spikelets, which are often reddish in color. The species is adapted to nutrient-poor environments and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
