    "intro": "Calpidisca lundii, commonly known as the red-flowered orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. Native to the mountainous regions of Central America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its most distinctive feature is its vivid red petals, which contrast sharply with its green foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom during the late spring and early summer. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Calpidisca lundii is considered endangered in the wild."
