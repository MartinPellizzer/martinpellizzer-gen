    "intro": "Cineraria palustris f. simplicior, commonly known as the marsh cineraria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland environments. It features silver-gray, velvety foliage that helps it retain moisture in its humid habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshes and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking to add texture and color to water gardens."
