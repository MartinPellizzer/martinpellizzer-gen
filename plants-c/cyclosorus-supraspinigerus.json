    "intro": "Cyclosorus supraspinigerus, commonly known as the golden spike moss, is a small, terrestrial liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinctive morphology with a prostrate stem that bears dense clusters of small, spirally arranged leaves. The leaves are lanceolate and often have a yellowish-green color, contributing to its common name. This species is typically found in rocky crevices or on decaying wood in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are inconspicuous and develop from the gametophyte stage."
