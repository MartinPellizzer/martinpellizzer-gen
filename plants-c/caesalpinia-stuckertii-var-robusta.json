    "intro": "Caesalpinia stuckertii var. robusta, commonly known as the robusta flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange inflorescences that resemble flames, which appear in clusters at the ends of branches. The leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments, giving the plant a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces elongated, woody pods that contain several seeds, and it thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes due to its vibrant floral display."
