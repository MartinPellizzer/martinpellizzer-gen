    "intro": "Cordia domestica var. evolutior, commonly known as the African starfruit or yellow starwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey-barked trunk and opposite, ovate leaves that are often gland-dotted. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by star-shaped, orange to red fruits resembling the common starfruit. The fruits are edible, with a sweet and tangy flavor, and are often consumed fresh or used in jams and beverages. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its medicinal properties."
