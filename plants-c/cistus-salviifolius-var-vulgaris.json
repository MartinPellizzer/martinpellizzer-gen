    "intro": "Cistus salviifolius var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common rockrose, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and coastal environments. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
