    "intro": "Cystorchis obscura, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying entirely on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer, often in shaded, humid environments. Its unique morphology and specific habitat requirements make it a challenging species to study and conserve. Cystorchis obscura is also known for its symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, which aid in its nutrient uptake."
