    "intro": "Chamaeanthus minimus, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped white flowers that appear in spring. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year, providing a dense canopy. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
