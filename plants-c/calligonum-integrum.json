    "intro": "Calligonum integrum, commonly known as the sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with woody stems and small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is highly drought-tolerant. Due to its resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
