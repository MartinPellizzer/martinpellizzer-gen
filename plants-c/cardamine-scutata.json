    "intro": "Cardamine scutata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water crowfoot, is a small perennial herb belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating on the surface of freshwater environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with five sepals and numerous stamens, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils near streams, ponds, and wet meadows. Due to its preference for clean water and specific soil conditions, it is often used as an indicator species for water quality."
