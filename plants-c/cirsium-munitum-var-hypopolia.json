    "intro": "Cirsium munitum var. hypopolia, commonly known as the coastal tarweed, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in coastal and maritime environments, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces yellow to orange flowers in late summer. Its flowers are typically arranged in a single, terminal head, and the plant is adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for pollinators."
