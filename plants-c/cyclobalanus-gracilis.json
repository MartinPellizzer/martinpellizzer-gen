It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to greenish in color and are borne in clusters. Cyclobalanus gracilis is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
