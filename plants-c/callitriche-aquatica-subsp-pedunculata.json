    "intro": "Callitriche aquatica subsp. pedunculata, commonly known as water starwort, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats. It features small, oval leaves arranged in whorls along its branching stems. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that are often submerged but can emerge at the water's surface. It thrives in slow-moving to still waters, such as ponds and lakes. Its presence is an indicator of good water quality and is often found in nutrient-rich environments."
