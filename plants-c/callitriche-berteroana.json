It typically grows in shallow water, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has tiny, star-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers. It is an annual or short-lived perennial, with a compact growth habit. Its presence indicates healthy wetland ecosystems and it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
