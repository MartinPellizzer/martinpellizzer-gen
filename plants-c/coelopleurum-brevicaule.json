    "intro": "Coelopleurum brevicaule, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used for trapping microscopic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its leaves are short and often clustered at the base, with a unique appearance that helps distinguish it from other aquatic species. Coelopleurum brevicaule plays a minor role in aquatic ecosystems but is of interest to botanists due to its specialized adaptations."
