It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white. The plant is known for secreting a resinous sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic compounds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and pharmacological studies."
