    "intro": "Cleistocactus viridialabastri, commonly known as the green-lime cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, columnar stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually yellow or orange, blooming during the warmer months. It has a dense covering of fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This cactus is well adapted to extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems."
