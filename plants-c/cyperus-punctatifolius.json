It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves with distinctive white or pale green spots along the midrib. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically important in wetland ecosystems."
