    "intro": "Cryptocodon, commonly known as the Chinese bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Cryptocodon dissectus, which is native to East Asia. These plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The leaves are typically lobed or dissected, giving the plant a delicate, fern-like appearance. Cryptocodon species are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and are relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
