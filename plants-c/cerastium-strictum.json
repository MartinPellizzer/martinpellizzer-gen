    "intro": "Cerastium strictum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, hairy leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Cerastium strictum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
