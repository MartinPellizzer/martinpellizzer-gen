    "intro": "Chrysophyllum brachystylum, commonly known as the dwarf star apple, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The tree produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to those of the star apple, with a sweet, juicy pulp. It thrives in humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less commonly studied species."
