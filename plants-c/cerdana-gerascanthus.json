    "intro": "Cerdana gerascanthus, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant orange and yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention in its arid habitat. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor in rocky soils, while its pollination is primarily carried out by specific species of bees and wasps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cerdana gerascanthus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
