    "intro": "Crataegus demissa, commonly known as the Downy Hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and dense clusters of white to pale pink flowers in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but generally unpalatable to humans. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodlands, along stream banks, and in open fields. The Downy Hawthorn is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting a range of wildlife."
