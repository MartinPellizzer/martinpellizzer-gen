    "intro": "Cyperus brunneofibrosus, commonly known as the brown-fibrous flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, which are often subtended by bracts. Cyperus brunneofibrosus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate waterlogged conditions."
