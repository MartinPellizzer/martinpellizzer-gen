    "intro": "Caragana laetevirens, commonly known as the sweet caragana, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 11 leaflets, and its yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Caragana laetevirens is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
