    "intro": "Cylindropuntia schottii, commonly known as the Schott's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in spines and are often green in color. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments. Cylindropuntia schottii plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing food and shelter for various desert animals."
