    "intro": "Cousinia neurophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cousinia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble single flowers. The plant is typically found in rocky soils and has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Cousinia neurophylla produces small, yellow to pale brown flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
