    "intro": "Cuscuta legitima, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant's seeds are dispersed through the wind, allowing it to colonize a wide range of host species. It is often found on crops such as soybeans and cotton, causing significant agricultural damage. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, with the plant growing and reproducing in direct association with the host's vascular system."
