    "intro": "Cissus rotundifolia var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leafed grape ivy, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often covered in small, white, translucent glands. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, grape-like berries that are popular in local cuisines. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often used as a decorative plant in gardens and indoor spaces. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular choice for vertical gardening and hanging baskets."
