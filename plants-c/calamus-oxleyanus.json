    "intro": "Calamus oxleyanus, commonly known as the oxleyan arrowroot, is a member of the Arecaceae family, native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a tall, slender grass-like plant that can grow up to several meters in height, with long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by three-lobed fruits containing edible seeds. Its rhizomes are valued for their starchy, tuberous roots, which are used as a food source in some cultures. Due to its unique botanical features and traditional uses, it holds significance in both ecological and cultural contexts."
