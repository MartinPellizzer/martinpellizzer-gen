    "intro": "Craterostigma hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy rock cress, is a small, perennial herb native to arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It has a deep root system that enables it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. Craterostigma hirsutum is also notable for its ability to survive extreme temperature fluctuations and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
