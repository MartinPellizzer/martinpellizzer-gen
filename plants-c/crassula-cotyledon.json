It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring. Its compact growth habit makes it ideal for container gardening. The leaves are often marked with a distinctive red or purple hue, especially when exposed to sunlight."
