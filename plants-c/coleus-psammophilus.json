    "intro": "Coleus psammophilus, commonly known as the sand-loving coleus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from red to purple. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its foliage is typically small and hairy, which helps reduce water loss. Coleus psammophilus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its striking floral display and drought tolerance."
