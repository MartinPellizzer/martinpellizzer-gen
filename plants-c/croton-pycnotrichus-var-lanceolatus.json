    "intro": "Croton pycnotrichus var. lanceolatus, commonly known as the lanceleaf croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, colorful foliage with leaves that are lance-shaped and often adorned with vibrant red, yellow, and green hues. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by spiny, woody capsules containing seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
