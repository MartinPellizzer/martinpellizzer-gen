    "intro": "Cuscuta obtusiflora var. cesatiana, commonly known as the woolly dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, hairy appearance due to its numerous slender, thread-like stems. The plant is native to regions of North America and is often found growing on various host species, including grasses and forbs. Its life cycle involves germination, attachment to a host, and the development of a complex root system to extract nutrients. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in ecological systems by influencing host plant growth and diversity."
