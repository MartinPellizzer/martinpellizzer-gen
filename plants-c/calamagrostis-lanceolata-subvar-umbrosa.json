    "intro": "Calamagrostis lanceolata subvar. umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow reed, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It features slender, arching culms that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, often growing in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and stream banks. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and the plant produces panicles of fluffy, silver-gray seeds in late summer. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for wetland restoration and ecological landscaping. It is also appreciated for its ornamental value in garden settings."
