    "intro": "Catas parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered catas, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, delicate white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, round fruits that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
