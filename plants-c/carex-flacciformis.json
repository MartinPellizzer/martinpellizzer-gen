    "intro": "Carex flacciformis, commonly known as the slender flatleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually light green to bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, three-stamened flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Carex flacciformis plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
