    "intro": "Cryophytum planum, commonly known as the flatland frost plant, is a unique species adapted to cold and arid environments. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, fleshy leaves that store water. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically important species in its native range."
