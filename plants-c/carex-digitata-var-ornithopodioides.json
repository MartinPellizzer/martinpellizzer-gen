    "intro": "Carex digitata var. ornithopodioides, commonly known as the ornithopodioides sedge, is a variant of the common sedge species Carex digitata. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia, typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. The plant features grass-like leaves that are narrow and slightly curved, with a distinct midrib. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, three-lobed flowers, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
