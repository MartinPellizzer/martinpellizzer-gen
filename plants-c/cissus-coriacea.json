    "intro": "Cissus coriacea, commonly known as the bone plant or rock fig, is a climbing shrub native to southern Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into edible, fig-like fruits. Its stems are woody and can grow along the ground or climb over rocks and other surfaces. Cissus coriacea is well adapted to rocky and dry habitats, making it a resilient and hardy species."
