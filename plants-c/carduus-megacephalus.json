    "intro": "Carduus megacephalus, commonly known as the giant thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, spiny, purple flower heads that resemble a crown, hence its scientific name. The plant has a robust taproot system and can grow up to 2 meters tall, making it a striking presence in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a rough, hairy texture and a distinct central spine. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry grasslands, where it thrives in full sun."
