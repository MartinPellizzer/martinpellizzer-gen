    "intro": "[WRONG START] Codia banalo, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, woody trunk and broad, glossy leaves that help it thrive in saline environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by fleshy, red berries containing numerous seeds. Its roots form a complex network that stabilizes coastal sediments, playing a vital role in preventing erosion. Cordia banalo is also valued for its medicinal properties, with various parts of the plant used in traditional remedies."
