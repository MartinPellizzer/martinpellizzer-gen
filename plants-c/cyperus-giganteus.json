    "intro": "Cyperus giganteus, commonly known as the giant flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features tall, grass-like stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in summer. Cyperus giganteus thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas or along waterways. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain environments."
