    "intro": "Centaurea ornata subsp. ornata, commonly known as the ornate centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands. It produces small, spiky seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal. Centaurea ornata subsp. ornata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
