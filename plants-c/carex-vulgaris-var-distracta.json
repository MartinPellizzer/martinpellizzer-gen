    "intro": "Carex vulgaris var. distracta, commonly known as the common sedge. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas across Europe and parts of Asia. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in moist environments. Carex vulgaris var. distracta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
