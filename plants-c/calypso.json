    "intro": "Calypso, commonly known as the \"Queen of the Sea,\" is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bi-color flowers that often feature a combination of purple and white hues. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or near streams. Its delicate, fragrant blooms are short-lived, adding to its mystique. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Calypso is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
