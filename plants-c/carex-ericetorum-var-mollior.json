    "intro": "Carex ericetorum var. mollior, commonly known as the soft-haired sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often in woodland or heathland environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, and it is often found in association with heather and other acid-loving plants. Its delicate, soft foliage gives it a distinctive appearance, making it a valuable addition to wetland gardens."
