    "intro": "Carex minuta, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to moist, temperate regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Carex minuta typically grows in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats where it thrives in partial to full shade. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often used in native plant gardens for its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
