    "intro": "Cyclosorus striatus var. molundensis, commonly known as the Molund's water clover, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It features delicate, floating leaves that are typically divided into small, overlapping lobes, resembling a clover leaf. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to substrates. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often submerged or floating near the water's surface. The varietal form, molundensis, is distinguished by its unique leaf patterns and habitat preferences compared to the standard species."
