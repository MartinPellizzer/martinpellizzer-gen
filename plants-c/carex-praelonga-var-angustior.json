    "intro": "Carex praelonga var. angustior, commonly known as narrowleaf bog sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a tight, cylindrical cluster. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Carex praelonga."
