It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its umbel-shaped inflorescences. The plant features slender, hollow stems and fern-like, pinnately compound leaves. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Historically, it has been used in traditional medicine for its purported digestive and diuretic properties."
