    "intro": "Chlidanthus cardenasii, commonly known as the Cienega daisy, is a flowering plant native to the Sonoran Desert in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces showy yellow flowers with white markings. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements. It plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and provides nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in some regions."
