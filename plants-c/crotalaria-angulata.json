    "intro": "Crotalaria angulata, commonly known as devil's bean, is an annual herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, also known as the legume or pea family, and is characterized by its distinctive triangular leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Crotalaria angulata is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a useful plant in agricultural systems. However, it is also considered a weed and can be toxic to livestock due to the presence of alkaloids."
