    "intro": "Cremastopus, commonly known as the rock oak or rock holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and shrub-like growth habit, often found in rocky or mountainous regions. The leaves are typically leathery and dark green, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Cremastopus species produce small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in spring or early summer. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
