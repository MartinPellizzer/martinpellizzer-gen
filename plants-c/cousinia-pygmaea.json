    "intro": "Cousinia pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf cudweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It features dense clusters of small, pink or purple flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy environments. Cousinia pygmaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
