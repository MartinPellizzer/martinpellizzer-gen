    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 limula var. submiliaris, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a hybrid sedge species characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, pond edges, and along streams, where it thrives in partial to full shade. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered in a tight, cylindrical shape. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. The leaves are usually narrow and slightly curved, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in wetland conditions."
