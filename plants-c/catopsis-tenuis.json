It is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a cup-like structure to collect rainwater. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in a short inflorescence. Catopsis tenuis is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and attractive foliage."
