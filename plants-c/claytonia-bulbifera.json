    "intro": "Claytonia bulbifera, commonly known as the bulbous spring beauty, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in early spring, typically above the foliage. Its bulbs, which are modified stems, serve as storage organs and help the plant survive periods of dormancy. Claytonia bulbifera is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy member of the Portulacaceae family."
