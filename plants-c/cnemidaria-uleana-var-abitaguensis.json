    "intro": "Cnemidaria uleana var. abitaguensis, commonly known as the Abitagua fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizomorphs, which help in nutrient absorption. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in rows on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of many fern species."
