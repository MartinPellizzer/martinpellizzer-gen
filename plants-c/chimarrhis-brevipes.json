    "intro": "Chimarrhis brevipes, commonly known as the narrowleaf hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and narrow, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, globular flowers that are typically pink or red, arranged in spikes along the stems. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions. Chimarrhis brevipes is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native garden landscapes."
