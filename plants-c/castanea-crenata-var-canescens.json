    "intro": "Castanea crenata var. canescens, commonly known as the Japanese chestnut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its smooth, gray-brown bark and palmately compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by spiny, oval-shaped nuts encased in a thick, scaly husk. The nuts are edible after the husk is removed and the inner shell is cracked open. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible nuts."
