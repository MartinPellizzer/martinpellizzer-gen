It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, palmately divided leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. It is known for its ornamental value and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
