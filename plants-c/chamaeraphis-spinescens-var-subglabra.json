    "intro": "Chamaeraphis spinescens var. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and coastal environments. It features small, fleshy, spiny leaves that are typically covered with a fine layer of white hairs, though the variety subglabra lacks the typical pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, followed by small, round, red or orange berries. It is adapted to harsh, saline conditions and is often found in dunes and rocky shores. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture in arid environments."
