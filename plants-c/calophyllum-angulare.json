    "intro": "Calophyllum angulare, commonly known as the angular calophyllum, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, palmate leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in small inflorescences, followed by woody, orange-red fruits containing a single seed. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. The tree is also valued for its durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
