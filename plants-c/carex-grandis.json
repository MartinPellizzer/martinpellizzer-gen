    "intro": "Carex grandis, commonly known as the tall sedge, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, grasses, and reeds. This plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Carex grandis has tall, triangular stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered flowers in the summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
