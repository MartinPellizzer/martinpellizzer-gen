    "intro": "Cavendishia capitulata, commonly known as the golden crown cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a compact, rounded shape. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Cavendishia capitulata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
