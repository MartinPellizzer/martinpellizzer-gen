    "intro": "Calanthe abbreviata, commonly known as the dwarf calanthe, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically arranged in a raceme during the spring season. Calanthe abbreviata thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded ornamental plantings."
