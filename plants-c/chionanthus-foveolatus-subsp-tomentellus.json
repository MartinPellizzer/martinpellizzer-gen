    "intro": "Chionanthus foveolatus subsp. tomentellus, commonly known as the woolly chionanthus, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring, adding ornamental value to the landscape. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine, grayish-white pubescence. This subspecies is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
