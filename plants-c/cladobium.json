    "intro": "Cladobium, commonly known as the sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plants typically have small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Cladobium species are native to regions of Africa, the Americas, and parts of Asia. They are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and drought tolerance."
