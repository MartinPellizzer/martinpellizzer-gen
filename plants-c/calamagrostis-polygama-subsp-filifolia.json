    "intro": "[WRONG START] Calamagrostis polygama subsp. filiforia, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, silky foliage that gives it a soft, grass-like appearance. The plant produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from August to September. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in riparian zones and wet meadows. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for water gardens and native plant landscapes."
