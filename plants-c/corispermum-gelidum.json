    "intro": "Corispermum gelidum, commonly known as the cold flax or Arctic flax, is a small, herbaceous plant that thrives in harsh environments. It is native to Arctic and alpine regions, where it adapts to extreme cold and poor soil conditions. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain oily seeds, which are rich in essential nutrients. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in cold climates. Corispermum gelidum plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing food for local wildlife and contributing to soil stability in barren environments."
