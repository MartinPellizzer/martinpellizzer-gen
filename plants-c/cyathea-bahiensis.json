    "intro": "Cyathea bahiensis, commonly known as the Bahia tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Brazil. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a robust rhizome that supports its tall stature, often reaching several meters in height. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a deep green color and a leathery texture. Cyathea bahiensis thrives in humid, shaded environments, making it a common sight in tropical rainforests."
