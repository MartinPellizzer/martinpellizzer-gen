    "intro": "Cirsium richterianum subsp. giraudiasii, commonly known as the Giraudias' thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, which attract various pollinators. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller stature and more compact growth compared to the typical form of Cirsium richterianum."
