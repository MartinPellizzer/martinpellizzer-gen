    "intro": "Cacalia pyrifolia, commonly known as the fireleaf bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking, maple-like leaves that are often reddish or bronze in color. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal color changes and ability to attract pollinators."
