    "intro": "Calamagrostis subflexuosa, commonly known as river sedge, is a perennial grass native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, arching stems that often form dense clumps, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to moist landscapes. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistently moist to wet soil conditions. Calamagrostis subflexuosa is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
