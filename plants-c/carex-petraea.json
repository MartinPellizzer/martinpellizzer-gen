    "intro": "Carex petraea, commonly known as the rock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous or alpine environments. The plant has grass-like leaves that are usually narrow and slightly curled at the edges. Its flowering spikes are usually shorter than the leaves and produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex petraea is well adapted to harsh conditions and is often found in rocky crevices or on slopes."
