    "intro": "Convolvulus cyclostegius, commonly known as the narrowleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, twisting stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in the morning. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
