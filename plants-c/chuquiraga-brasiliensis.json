    "intro": "Chuquiraga brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian burr or Brazilian thistle, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its prickly, spiny stems and leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer, followed by spherical, hairy fruit heads that contain seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural areas."
