    "intro": "Cerionanthus leucanthus, commonly known as the white-flowered snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with dark green, ovate leaves that are densely arranged along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
