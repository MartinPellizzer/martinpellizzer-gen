    "intro": "Cyathea punctulata, commonly known as the punctulate tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family. It is a tall, evergreen fern that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its robust, trunk-like stem and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a distinctive veining pattern, while its roots form a dense, fibrous network that helps stabilize the soil. Cyathea punctulata is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and along riverbanks."
