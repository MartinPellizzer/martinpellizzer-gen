    "intro": "Chondradenia doyonensis, commonly known as the Doyon's chondradenia, is a rare and lesser-known species of flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its woody structure and showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, thriving in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall. Its flowers are usually pink or red, with five petals and a prominent central stamen, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chondradenia doyonensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
