    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia subsp. kemensis, commonly known as the Kemensian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of rounded, velvety leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and delicate flowers. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in the wild."
