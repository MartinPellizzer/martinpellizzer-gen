    "intro": "Citrus grandis var. oblonga, commonly known as the longan tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and dense, glossy evergreen leaves that are elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible drupes with a smooth, brownish skin and a single, large, whitish seed. The fruit is prized for its sweet, slightly tart flavor and is often consumed fresh or used in culinary applications. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
