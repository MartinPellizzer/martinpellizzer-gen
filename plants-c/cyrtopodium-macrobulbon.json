    "intro": "Cyrtopodium macrobulbon, commonly known as the large-bulb orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its erect, leafy stems and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in seasonal environments. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, enhancing nutrient absorption. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
