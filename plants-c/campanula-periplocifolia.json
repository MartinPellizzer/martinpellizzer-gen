    "intro": "Campanula periplocifolia, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped blue or purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Campanula periplocifolia is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
