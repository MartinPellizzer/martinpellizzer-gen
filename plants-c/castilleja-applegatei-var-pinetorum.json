    "intro": "Castilleja applegatei var. pinetorum, commonly known as the redstem Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vivid red-orange bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for water and nutrients, often parasitizing conifers like ponderosa pine. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This species is adapted to dry, open habitats and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soils."
