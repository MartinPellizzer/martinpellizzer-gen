It is characterized by its bright red stems that stand out in the winter, providing visual interest throughout the year. The plant produces small white or pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by red berries in the fall. Its leaves are typically ovate with a slightly serrated edge, and they turn yellow or red in the autumn. Cornus fulvescens is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
