    "intro": "Carex pairae var. monostachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, greenish-brown flowers in the summer. It is characterized by its monostachya inflorescence, which means it has a single, elongated flowering spike. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
