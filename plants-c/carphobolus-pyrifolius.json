It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that resemble the shape of a fire leaf, hence its common name. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and ornamental gardening."
