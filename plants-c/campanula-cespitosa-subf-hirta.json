    "intro": "Campanula cespitosa subf. hirta, commonly known as the hairy bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact, clump-forming growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its subspecies name. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks."
