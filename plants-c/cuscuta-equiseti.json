    "intro": "Cuscuta equiseti, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It attaches itself to a variety of host plants, including grasses and sedges, using specialized haustoria to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found in moist, disturbed habitats. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or water, contributing to its widespread distribution. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants."
