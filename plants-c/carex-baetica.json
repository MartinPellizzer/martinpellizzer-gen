    "intro": "Carex baetica, commonly known as the Iberian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, and it produces small, clustered spikelets that contain both male and female flowers. Carex baetica plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various invertebrates and small vertebrates."
