    "intro": "Centaurea petteri, commonly known as the Eastern Carpathian cornflower, is a flowering plant native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its showy inflorescence. Centaurea petteri is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
