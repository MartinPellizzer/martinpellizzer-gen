    "intro": "Colymbada calcarea, commonly known as the limestone rock cress, is a perennial flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It thrives in calcareous soils, often found on rocky or limestone outcrops. The plant features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a basal rosette structure that helps it conserve moisture. Colymbada calcarea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to colonize difficult, alkaline environments."
