    "intro": "Cyathea rigidula, commonly known as the rigid tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in persistent, fibrous roots. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Cyathea rigidula thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular ornamental plant in tropical gardens."
