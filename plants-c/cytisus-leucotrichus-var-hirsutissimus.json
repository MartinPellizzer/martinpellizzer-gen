It is characterized by its dense, wiry, gray-green foliage and produces clusters of bright yellow, pea-like flowers in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions. It is often found in coastal areas and can tolerate salt spray. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
