    "intro": "Circaea lutetiana var. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has hairy, slender stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its scientific name reflects its deceptive appearance, as it resembles other white-flowered plants in its habitat."
