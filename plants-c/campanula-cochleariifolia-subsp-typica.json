    "intro": "Campanula cochleariifolia subsp. typica, commonly known as the bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with hairy undersides, and its root system consists of fibrous roots that help it anchor in rocky or well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and open woodlands, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, bell-like flowers."
