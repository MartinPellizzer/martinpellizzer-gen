It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, violet-pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its small, ovate leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
