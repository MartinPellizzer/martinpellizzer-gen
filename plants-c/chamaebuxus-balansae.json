    "intro": "Chamaebuxus balansae, commonly known as the Balansae Buxus, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features dense, dark green foliage that remains compact and neat throughout the year. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves with a waxy texture, and its flowers are inconspicuous, appearing in clusters during the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a foundation plant. Due to its slow growth and hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate urban conditions."
