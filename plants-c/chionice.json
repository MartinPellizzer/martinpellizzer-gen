It features small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often in cold and snowy conditions. The plant has a low-growing habit with slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It is adapted to survive in harsh, alpine environments with low temperatures and limited soil nutrients. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
