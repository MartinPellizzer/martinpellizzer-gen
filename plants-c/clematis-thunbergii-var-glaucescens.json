It features compound leaves with three to five oval-shaped leaflets that are often covered in a bluish waxy coating. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of blue or purple. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden landscapes for its vigorous climbing habit."
