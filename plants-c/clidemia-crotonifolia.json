    "intro": "Clidemia crotonifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false croton, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests and along stream banks. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain areas, impacting local ecosystems."
