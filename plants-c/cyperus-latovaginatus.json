    "intro": "Cyperus latovaginatus, commonly known as the broad-leaved flatsedge, is a member of the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, preferring moist to saturated soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands. Cyperus latovaginatus plays a role in stabilizing soil in aquatic habitats and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
