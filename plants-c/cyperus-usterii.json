    "intro": "Cyperus usterii, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and clustered flowering heads. Native to parts of Africa, it thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes and streambanks. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikes, and it produces three-sided, triangular seeds. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats and is sometimes used in ornamental gardening."
