The plant typically grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters, with its inflorescence bearing several white or pale pink flowers. Its root system is adapted to waterlogged soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Cristaria gracilis is often found in association with other wetland flora, contributing to the biodiversity of these habitats."
