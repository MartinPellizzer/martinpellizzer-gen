    "intro": "Cynanchum violator, commonly known as blue milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes other milkweeds, and is characterized by its showy, often violet or blue flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Cynanchum violator thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
