    "intro": "Corispermum stauntonii, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Amaranthaceae. It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. The seeds are enclosed in small, hard capsules, which help in dispersal by wind or through attachment to animals."
