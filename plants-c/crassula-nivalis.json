It is characterized by its dense, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid or semi-arid environments. Crassula nivalis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements."
