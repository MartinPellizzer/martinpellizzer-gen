    "intro": "Codonium, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Goodeniaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky, blue or purple flowers that resemble holly berries. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and saline soils, thriving in harsh, maritime environments. Codonium species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to tolerate salt spray. Their leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions."
