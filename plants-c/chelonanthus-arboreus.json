    "intro": "Chelonanthus arboreus, commonly known as the tree of heaven, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, featuring a straight trunk and dense foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate, with a smooth margin and a slightly glossy surface. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the wild."
