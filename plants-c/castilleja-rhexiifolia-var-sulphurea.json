    "intro": "Castilleja rhexiifolia var. sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphurhead Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow to orange-red bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant has a slender, hairy stem and produces small, white flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants, making it an important component of its ecosystem."
