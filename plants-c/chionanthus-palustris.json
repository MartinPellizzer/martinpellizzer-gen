    "intro": "Chionanthus palustris, commonly known as the flowering dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, white or cream-colored flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn a striking red or purple in the fall. Chionanthus palustris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
