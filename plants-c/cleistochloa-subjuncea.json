    "intro": "Cleistochloa subjuncea, commonly known as the narrowleaf grass, is a small, perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in low, compact clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often densely packed. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are usually wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. Cleistochloa subjuncea is adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions, including drought and poor soil, which contributes to its widespread distribution."
