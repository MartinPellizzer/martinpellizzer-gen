    "intro": "Canarium pseudopimela, commonly known as the false white ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and thrives in humid, warm climates. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural propagation in its native habitat."
