    "intro": "Chrysanthemum graminifolium, commonly known as the grass-leaved chrysanthemum, is a herbaceous perennial native to East Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are alternate and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, white, and orange, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators make it a popular choice in horticulture."
