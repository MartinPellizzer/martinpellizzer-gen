    "intro": "Cardiaca, commonly known as the heartsease, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows to a height of 10 to 30 centimeters and has linear, grass-like leaves. Cardiaca thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Its name is derived from the Latin word \"cardo,\" meaning heart, possibly due to the shape of its flowers or traditional medicinal uses."
