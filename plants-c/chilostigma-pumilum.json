    "intro": "Chilostigma pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf chilostigma, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, exhibiting a compact growth habit with small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, yellowish flowers with five petals, which bloom in the spring. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a short, upright stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
