    "intro": "Cassia auriculata, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to India and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendulous clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. The leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, giving the plant a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
