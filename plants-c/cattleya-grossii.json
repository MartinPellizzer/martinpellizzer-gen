    "intro": "Cattleya grossii, commonly known as the imperial orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically feature a vibrant pink or purple color with a contrasting white or yellow lip. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, meaning it grows in segments with each segment producing a new set of leaves and flowers. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Cattleya grossii is highly valued in horticulture for its beauty and fragrance, making it a popular choice for ornamental cultivation."
