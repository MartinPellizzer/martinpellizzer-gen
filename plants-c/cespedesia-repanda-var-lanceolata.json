    "intro": "Cespedesia repanda var. lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-gray bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its elegant foliage and ability to form dense, low-growing turf-like mats."
