    "intro": "Conocephalus borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean conocephalus, is a species of orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and strikingly colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the dense canopy of tropical forests. Its flowers, which can be white, yellow, or orange, are often fragrant and attract various pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
