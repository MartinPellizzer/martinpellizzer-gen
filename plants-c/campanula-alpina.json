    "intro": "Campanula alpina, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm and features basal rosettes of silver-gray, woolly leaves. The plant produces bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine habitats. Campanula alpina is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual appeal."
