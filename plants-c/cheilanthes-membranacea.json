    "intro": "Cheilanthes membranacea, commonly known as the membranous rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It typically grows on rock surfaces or in crevices, where it can access moisture from condensation. Cheilanthes membranacea is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats."
