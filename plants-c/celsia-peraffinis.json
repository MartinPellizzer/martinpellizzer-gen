    "intro": "Celsia peraffinis, commonly known as the slender celsia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its fruit is a small, berry-like structure that contains several seeds, and it is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
