    "intro": "Cynanchum riparium, commonly known as water dogbane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and riverbanks in North America. It features slender, erect stems that often grow up to 1.5 meters in height, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in areas with standing or flowing water. Cynanchum riparium is noted for its adaptability to wet environments and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
