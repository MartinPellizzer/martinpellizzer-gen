    "intro": "Cactus ayrampo, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its spherical shape and distinctive yellow spines that give it its common name. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of yellow and orange, are typically produced at the top of the plant. The cactus is also known for its ability to produce a milky sap that can be used in traditional medicine."
