    "intro": "Carthamus nitidus, commonly known as the smooth safflower, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces showy, bright yellow to orange flowers. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, powdery coating. Its scientific name, Carthamus, refers to the ancient Greek word for \"chariot,\" possibly due to the plant's historical use in dyeing fabrics. Carthamus nitidus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
