    "intro": "Celsia straussii, commonly known as the Strauss's celsia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a silver-gray underside, and produces showy yellow flowers in the spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
