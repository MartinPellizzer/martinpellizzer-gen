It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are often used as a food source in some regions. Crotalaria pumila is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. However, it can also be invasive in certain areas, posing a challenge for agricultural and ecological management."
