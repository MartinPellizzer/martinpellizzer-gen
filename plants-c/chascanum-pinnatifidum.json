    "intro": "Chascanum pinnatifidum, commonly known as the Chilean fire bush, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with woody stems and evergreen leaves. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure and bright colors. Chascanum pinnatifidum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
