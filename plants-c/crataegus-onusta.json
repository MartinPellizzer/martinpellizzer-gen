    "intro": "Crataegus onusta, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries known as haws, which are edible but often used in jams and wines. Crataegus onusta is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential cardiovascular benefits."
