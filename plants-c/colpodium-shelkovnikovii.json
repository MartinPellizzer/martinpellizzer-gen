It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and finely divided leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. It is known for its unique morphology and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
