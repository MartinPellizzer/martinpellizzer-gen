    "intro": "Cyanocephalus, commonly known as the blue-headed vulture, is a large bird of prey native to Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive blue-gray head and neck, which contrast with its darker body plumage. The species has a wingspan that can reach up to 2.5 meters, making it one of the largest raptors in the region. Cyanocephalus primarily feeds on carrion, playing a crucial role in scavenging and maintaining ecosystem balance. Its nesting habits involve using tall trees or cliffs, where it lays a single egg each breeding season."
