    "intro": "Cephalanthera pusilla, commonly known as the small green twayblade, is a diminutive orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, leafless stem that typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a spike, and it lacks true leaves, relying instead on its photosynthetic stem. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows. Cephalanthera pusilla is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its unique morphology and ecological significance."
