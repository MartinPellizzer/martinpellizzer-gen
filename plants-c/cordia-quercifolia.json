    "intro": "Cordia quercifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaf cordia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically lobed and resemble those of an oak tree. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or dry forest habitats. Cordia quercifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
