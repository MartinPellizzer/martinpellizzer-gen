    "intro": "Cynoglossum leptophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring lance-shaped, often hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are tubular in shape and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable addition to gardens and wildflower meadows. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for both ecological and ornamental purposes."
