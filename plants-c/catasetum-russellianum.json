    "intro": "Catasetum russellianum, commonly known as Russell's orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its showy, often fragrant flowers that can range in color from yellow to orange and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its flowers are unique in that they have a specialized structure called a \"catasetum,\" which is used in pollination by certain bee species. The plant prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
