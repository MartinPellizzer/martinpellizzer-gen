It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its blue to purple flowers bloom in summer, and it produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by the wind.
