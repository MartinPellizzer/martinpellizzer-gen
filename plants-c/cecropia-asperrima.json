    "intro": "Cecropia asperrima, commonly known as the rough ceiba, is a fast-growing, deciduous tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and a distinctive, buttressed trunk that aids in stabilizing it in loose soil. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, three-lobed fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats. Cecropia asperrima plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various animals and insects."
