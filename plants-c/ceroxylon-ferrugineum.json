    "intro": "Ceroxylon ferrugineum, commonly known as the red cedar or the Andean cedar, is a coniferous tree native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, needle-like foliage that forms a conical shape. The plant has scale-like leaves that are reddish-brown in color, giving it its common name. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and plays an important role in the ecosystems of the Andes."
