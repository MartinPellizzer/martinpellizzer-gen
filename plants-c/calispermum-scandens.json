The plant features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and slightly hairy. Its fruit is a slender, cylindrical silique that contains several seeds. Calispermum scandens is known for its rapid growth and ability to climb using its tendrils, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
