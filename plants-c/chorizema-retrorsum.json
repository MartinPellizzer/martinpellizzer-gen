    "intro": "Chorizema retrorsum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, round, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
