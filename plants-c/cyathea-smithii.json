    "intro": "Cyathea smithii, commonly known as the Smith's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a distinctive crown of pinnate leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. Cyathea smithii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a significant component of New Zealand's native flora."
