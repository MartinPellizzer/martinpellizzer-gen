    "intro": "Costus giganteus, commonly known as the giant costus, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 6 feet. The plant produces large, showy bracts in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which are often mistaken for flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Costus giganteus thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
