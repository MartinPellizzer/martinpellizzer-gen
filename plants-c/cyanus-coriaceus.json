    "intro": "Cyanus coriaceus, commonly known as the hard-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, waxy leaves and its showy yellow to orange composite flower heads. The plant belongs to the family Asteraceae and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into achene fruits. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but also has ornamental value in gardens."
