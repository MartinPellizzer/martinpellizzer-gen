    "intro": "Corallorhiza spicata, commonly known as the spike coralroot, is an epiphytic orchid that lacks chlorophyll and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. It is native to eastern North America and thrives in shaded, moist forest habitats. The plant produces a tall, unbranched stem with numerous small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, enabling it to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil. Due to its reliance on fungi and specific environmental conditions, it is often considered a rare and specialized species."
