    "intro": "Carex complanata subsp. hirsutella, commonly known as the hairy flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and have a slightly hairy texture, which gives the subspecies its common name. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream edges. This plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
