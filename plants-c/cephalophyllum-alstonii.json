    "intro": "Cephalophyllum alstonii, commonly known as the Alston's headplant, is a rare and unique succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive rosette-shaped growth pattern and fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with red stamens, which appear at the center of the rosette. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water to survive. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
