    "intro": "Cantuffa microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved cantuffa, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is aromatic, with a scent reminiscent of citrus, and it is often used in traditional herbal remedies. Cantuffa microphylla is relatively drought-tolerant, making it a suitable plant for xeriscaping in arid climates."
