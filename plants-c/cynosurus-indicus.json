    "intro": "Cynosurus indicus, commonly known as the Indian couchgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Asia and parts of Africa. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows, marshes, and riverbanks. The plant has slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in clusters, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Cynosurus indicus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
