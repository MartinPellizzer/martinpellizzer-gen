    "intro": "Campanula carnosa, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and showy, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Campanula carnosa is often found in alpine or subalpine regions due to its cold tolerance. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
