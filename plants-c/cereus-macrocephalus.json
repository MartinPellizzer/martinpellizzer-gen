    "intro": "Cereus macrocephalus, commonly known as the giant night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night and remain open for only one night. These flowers are typically 30 centimeters in diameter, making them one of the largest among cacti. The plant is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping."
