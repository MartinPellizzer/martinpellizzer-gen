It is characterized by its thick, flaky bark and exudes a reddish latex when cut. The plant has prop roots that help stabilize the soil and filter salt from tidal waters. Its small, white flowers are followed by fleshy, red berries that attract various birds and animals. This species plays a crucial role in mangrove ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to coastal protection."
