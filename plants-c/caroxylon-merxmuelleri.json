    "intro": "Caroxylon merxmuelleri, commonly known as the Merxmueller's caroxylon, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Ephedraceae. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves, which are adapted to arid environments. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a thick, cylindrical trunk and a low-growing, branching structure. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in high-altitude, dry climates. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, Caroxylon merxmuelleri is considered a valuable subject for botanical research."
