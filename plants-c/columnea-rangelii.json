It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its showy blooms. Columnea rangelii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
