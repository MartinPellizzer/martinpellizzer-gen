It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically evergreen, and it produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers in the spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments.
