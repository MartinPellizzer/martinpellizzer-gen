    "intro": "Cyclamen deltoideum, commonly known as the delta cyclamen, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, and its flowers are typically pale pink to white with prominent red or purple markings. The plant produces tuberous roots that store nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. It blooms in late winter to early spring, adding vibrant color to alpine gardens. Cyclamen deltoideum prefers cool, moist environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
