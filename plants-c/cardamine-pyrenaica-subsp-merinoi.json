    "intro": "Cardamine pyrenaica subsp. merinoi, commonly known as the Pyrenean watercress, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces clusters of tiny white flowers in early spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from waterlogged soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
