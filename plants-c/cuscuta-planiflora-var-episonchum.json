    "intro": "Cuscuta planiflora var. episonchum, commonly known as the flatleaf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that coil around its host. The plant is native to parts of Asia and is often found growing on various shrubs and herbs. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host plants and is considered a potential agricultural pest in some regions."
