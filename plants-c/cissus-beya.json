    "intro": "Cissus beya, commonly known as the African snow vine, is a climbing plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its stems are woody and capable of rooting at the nodes, which aids in its climbing habit. Cissus beya is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appearance."
