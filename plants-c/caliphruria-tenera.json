    "intro": "Caliphruria tenera, commonly known as the slender rock cress, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
