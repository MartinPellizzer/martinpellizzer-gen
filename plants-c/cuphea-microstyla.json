    "intro": "Cuphea microstyla, commonly known as the \"whispering bells\" or \"false heather,\" is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features small, showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to pink and purple, which bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite and ovate in shape, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and containers. Cuphea microstyla is also valued for its ability to attract hummingbirds and other pollinators due to its nectar-rich flowers."
