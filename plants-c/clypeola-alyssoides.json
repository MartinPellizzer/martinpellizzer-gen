    "intro": "Clypeola alyssoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, often on rocky slopes and meadows. The plant features basal leaves that are narrowly elliptic and hairy, with small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Clypeola alyssoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
