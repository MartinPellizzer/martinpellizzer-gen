    "intro": "Costularia humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's costularia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, oblong fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
