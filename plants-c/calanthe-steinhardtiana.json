    "intro": "Calanthe steinhardtiana, commonly known as the Steinhardt's calanthe, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its erect, often hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
