    "intro": "Cypripedium insigne var. nilsonii, commonly known as the Nilson's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically pink or white with a contrasting veined pattern. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with a short rhizome and a single, fleshy leaf that is often covered in a dense layer of soft, white pubescence. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant is highly valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological significance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
