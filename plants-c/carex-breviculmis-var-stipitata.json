    "intro": "Carex breviculmis var. stipitata, commonly known as the short-bracted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known for their rhizomatous growth habits. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. This variety is distinguished by its short, bract-like structures at the base of the inflorescence, contributing to its unique botanical appearance."
