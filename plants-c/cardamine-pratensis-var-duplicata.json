    "intro": "Cardamine pratensis var. duplicata, commonly known as the double wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist meadows and grasslands in Europe. It features trifoliate leaves with a heart-shaped base and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a capsule fruit containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in partially shaded to sunny conditions and prefers well-drained, fertile soils. This variety is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology, with two pairs of leaves forming a more complex structure than the typical single leaflet."
