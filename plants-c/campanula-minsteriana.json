    "intro": "Campanula minsteriana, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is well adapted to alpine environments and is often found in meadows and woodlands at higher elevations. Campanula minsteriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive flowers."
