    "intro": "Cotyledon umbilicus-veneris var. subhorizontalis, commonly known as the \"moonlight\" cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. The leaves are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and the plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange. It is well-suited for arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in indoor or outdoor settings with proper care."
