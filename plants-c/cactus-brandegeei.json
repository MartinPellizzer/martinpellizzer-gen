    "intro": "Cactus brandegeei, commonly known as the Brandegee's cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus that typically forms a dense mat of fleshy, ribbed stems. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are often pollinated by bees and other insects. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and aesthetic appeal."
