    "intro": "Cleistocactus crassiserpens, commonly known as the thick-tongued cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a slow-growing, columnar cactus characterized by its dense, ribbed stems and spiny areoles. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its foliage is adapted to arid environments, with thick, water-storing stems that reduce transpiration. Cleistocactus crassiserpens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and resilience."
