    "intro": "Cistanthe maritima, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found along cliffs and dunes. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Cistanthe maritima is valued for its resilience and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
