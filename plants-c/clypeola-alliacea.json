    "intro": "Clypeola alliacea, commonly known as the garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and emit a garlic-like odor when crushed. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by triangular, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native plant species and disrupt local ecosystems."
