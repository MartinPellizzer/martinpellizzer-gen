It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in catkins, followed by distinctive red, fleshy berries that are a striking feature of the species. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with a tendency to form dense thickets in its natural habitat. The plant's botanical features make it an important component of the ecosystems it inhabits."
