    "intro": "Cuphea palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's cuphea, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces seed capsules that split open to release its tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Cuphea palmeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
