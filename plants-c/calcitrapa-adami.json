    "intro": "Calcitrapa adami, commonly known as the Adam's calcitrapa, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in umbels. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
