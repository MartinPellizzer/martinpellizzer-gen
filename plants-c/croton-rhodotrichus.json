    "intro": "Croton rhodotrichus, commonly known as the hairy croton, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, spiny capsules containing the seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
