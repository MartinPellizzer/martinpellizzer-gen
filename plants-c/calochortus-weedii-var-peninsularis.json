It is characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a yellow or green throat. The plant typically grows in rocky soils along coastal bluffs and dunes, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is often found in coastal scrub habitats. Calochortus weedii var. peninsularis is a rare and endangered species, facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
