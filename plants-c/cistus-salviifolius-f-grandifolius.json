It features aromatic, silver-gray foliage with lance-shaped leaves that are larger than those of the typical species. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for Mediterranean climates. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in garden settings."
