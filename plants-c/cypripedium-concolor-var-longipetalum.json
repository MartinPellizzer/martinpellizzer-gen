    "intro": "Cypripedium concolor var. longipetalum, commonly known as the long-petaled yellow lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which serves as a pollination mechanism. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and it produces a single flower per stem, often with a subtle fragrance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this variety is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
