    "intro": "Cerastium histrio, commonly known as the hairy mouse-ear or the scarlet mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine white trichomes. The flowers are typically pink to red in color, with five petals and numerous stamens, giving them a showy appearance. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant is known for its ability to spread rapidly through stolons, forming dense carpets that can suppress weed growth."
