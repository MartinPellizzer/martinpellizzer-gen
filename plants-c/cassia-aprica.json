It is characterized by its bright yellow, flame-like flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate or elliptical in shape. Cassia aprica produces long, slender pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in warmer climates."
