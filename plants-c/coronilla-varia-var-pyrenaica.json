    "intro": "Coronilla varia var. pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean variable vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale pink to violet. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. It has a deep root system that helps stabilize soil and is adapted to dry, temperate climates. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
