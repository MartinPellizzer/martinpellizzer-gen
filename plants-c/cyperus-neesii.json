    "intro": "Cyperus neesii, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically arranged in a dense, compact cluster. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Cyperus neesii is often found in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
