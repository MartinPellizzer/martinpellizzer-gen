    "intro": "Carex contigua, commonly known as slender flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Native to North America, it thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
