    "intro": "Chenopodium ambiguum, commonly known as wild spinach, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, alternate leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences. Its seeds are small and dry, typically dispersed by wind, contributing to its wide distribution. Chenopodium ambiguum is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is sometimes used as a leafy vegetable in traditional diets."
