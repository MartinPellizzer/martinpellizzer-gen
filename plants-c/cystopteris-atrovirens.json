    "intro": "Cystopteris atrovirens, commonly known as the black-veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern characterized by its delicate, floating fronds. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Asia and the Americas. The plant's fronds are typically divided into small, finger-like segments, and they possess a unique structure that allows them to float on the surface of water. Cystopteris atrovirens thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its role in aquatic ecosystems."
