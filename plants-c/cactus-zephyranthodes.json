    "intro": "Cactus zephyranthodes, commonly known as the desert daffodil, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a short, branching stem covered in spines, which help protect it from herbivores and reduce water loss. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, a common adaptation in arid environments. The plant is well adapted to survive in hot, dry conditions with minimal water requirements."
