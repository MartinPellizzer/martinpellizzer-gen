    "intro": "Corylopsis multiflora var. nivea, commonly known as the white-flowered winter honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has slender, arching stems and elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for garden borders or woodland edges. Its ornamental value lies in its early blooming habit and delicate floral display."
