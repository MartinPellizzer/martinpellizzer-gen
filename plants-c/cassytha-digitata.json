    "intro": "Cassytha digitata, commonly known as the slender dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants using haustoria, which absorb water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and has a vine-like structure that allows it to spread along the surface of its host. It is often found in wetland areas and can be an invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it unique among parasitic plants, as it relies entirely on its host for survival."
