    "intro": "Cyanea selachicauda, commonly known as the shark-tail orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its striking, elongated flower spikes that resemble the tail of a shark, hence its common name. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in clusters along the stem. Cyanea selachicauda is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts in Hawaii."
