    "intro": "Celsia pinetorum, commonly known as the pineleaf celsia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its needle-like leaves that resemble those of pine trees. The plant produces bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude forests. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, it is considered a vulnerable species."
