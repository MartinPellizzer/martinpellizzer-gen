    "intro": "Crepinella chimantensis subsp. multiramosa, commonly known as the Chimant\u00e9 multibranch crepe myrtle, is a shrub native to the humid forests of northern South America. It is characterized by its dense, often multi-branched growth habit and its showy, clustered inflorescences that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, followed by ornamental seed pods that persist into winter. Its leaves are typically lanceolate and have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are woody and often covered in a pale, powdery bloom. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its visual interest throughout the growing season."
