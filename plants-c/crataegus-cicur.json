    "intro": "Crataegus cicur, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers in the spring. The plant produces red or orange berries that are edible for birds and some mammals but are generally not consumed by humans. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and open areas. The botanical features of Crataegus cicur make it an important species for both ecological and ornamental purposes."
