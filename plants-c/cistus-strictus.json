    "intro": "Cistus strictus, commonly known as rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to arid environments. Its leaves are covered in a white, powdery coating called farina, which helps reduce water loss. Cistus strictus is also valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
