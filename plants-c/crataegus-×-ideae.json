    "intro": "Crataegus \u00d7 ideae, commonly known as the hybrid hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Crataegus monogyna (common hawthorn) and Crataegus laevigata (smooth hawthorn), resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The species is characterized by its thorny branches, elliptical leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of white or pink flowers in spring. It produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are edible for birds but generally not consumed by humans. Crataegus \u00d7 ideae is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges, thriving in well-drained soils across Europe."
