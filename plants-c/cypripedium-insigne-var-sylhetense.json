    "intro": "Cypripedium insigne var. sylhetense, commonly known as the Sylhet lady's slipper, is a rare orchid species native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with a deep pink lip and a greenish-yellow dorsal sepal. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its botanical features include a slender rhizome and a single, erect stem bearing a single flower. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several countries."
