    "intro": "Cyperus nudus, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas, ponds, and along waterways. Cyperus nudus produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are usually wind-pollinated. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
