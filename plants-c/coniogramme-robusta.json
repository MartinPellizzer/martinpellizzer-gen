    "intro": "Coniogramme robusta, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that are deeply divided into segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its fronds are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying and being replaced. Coniogramme robusta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
