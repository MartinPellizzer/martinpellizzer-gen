    "intro": "Cerastium latifolium var. pulvinatum, commonly known as the broadleaf mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground covers."
