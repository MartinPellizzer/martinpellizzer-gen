    "intro": "Caragana longiunguiculata, commonly known as the longleaf caragana, is a shrub or small tree native to central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 pairs of leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in raceme clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open to release the seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Caragana longiunguiculata is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
