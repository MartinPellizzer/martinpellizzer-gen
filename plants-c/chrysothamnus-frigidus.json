    "intro": "Chrysothamnus frigidus, commonly known as the alpine goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in a fine layer of white hairs that help reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions. Chrysothamnus frigidus is often found in alpine tundra and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small animals and insects."
