    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris serrulata, commonly known as the mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, bladder-like seed pods. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it a common weed in many regions."
