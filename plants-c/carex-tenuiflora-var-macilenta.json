    "intro": "Carex tenuiflora var. macilenta, commonly known as slender-flowered sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wet or moist environments in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in partial to full shade and requires consistently moist soil conditions. This variety is often used in native plant gardens for its ecological value and ability to stabilize wetland soils."
