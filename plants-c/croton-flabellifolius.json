    "intro": "Croton flabellifolius, commonly known as the fan-leaved croton, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its striking, palmately compound leaves that resemble a fan, with long, slender leaflets. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by orange to red berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
