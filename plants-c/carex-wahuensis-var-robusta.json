    "intro": "Carex wahuensis var. robusta, commonly known as the Wahu sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and spikelets that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in coastal or lowland habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically important species in its native range."
