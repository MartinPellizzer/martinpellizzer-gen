    "intro": "Cypella nivea, commonly known as the snow cypella, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a low-growing habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery bloom. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cypella nivea is considered a vulnerable species."
