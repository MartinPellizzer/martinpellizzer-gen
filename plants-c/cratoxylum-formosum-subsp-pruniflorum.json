    "intro": "Cratoxylum formosum subsp. pruniflorum, commonly known as the Taiwan flame tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy, red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests. Its ornamental value is due to its vibrant floral display, which occurs during the rainy season. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf and flower morphology compared to other Cratoxylum species."
