    "intro": "Cyclosorus calvescens, commonly known as the slender water shield, is a small aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. The plant has a distinctive rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that float on the water surface. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with three petals and three sepals. Cyclosorus calvescens plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through oxygen production."
