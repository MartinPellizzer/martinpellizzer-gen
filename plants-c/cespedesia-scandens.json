    "intro": "Cespedesia scandens, commonly known as silver bush or silverleaf cord grass, is a perennial, clump-forming plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It features narrow, silver-gray leaves with a soft texture, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by fluffy, seed-bearing structures. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. Cespedesia scandens thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adaptable to a variety of soil types."
