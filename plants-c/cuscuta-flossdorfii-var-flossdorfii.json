    "intro": "Cuscuta flossdorfii var. flossdorfii, commonly known as the Flossdorf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host plants. The plant is native to parts of Central and South America and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its life cycle involves germinating from seeds and establishing a connection with the host's vascular system. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
