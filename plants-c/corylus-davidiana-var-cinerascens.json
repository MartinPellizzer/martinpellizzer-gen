    "intro": "Corylus davidiana var. cinerascens, commonly known as the ash-leaf hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ash-gray leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, edible nuts enclosed in a spiky husk, typically ripening in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its unique foliage and seasonal interest."
