    "intro": "Capeochloa, commonly known as the Cape grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in dry, sandy soils. The plant typically grows as a perennial herb, characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Capeochloa species are often found in coastal and inland grasslands, adapting well to arid and semi-arid conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually arranged in spikelets, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
