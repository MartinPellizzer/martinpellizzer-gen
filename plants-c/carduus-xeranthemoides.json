It is characterized by its spiny, leafy stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a rosette growth habit, with thick, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater during droughts. The plant is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
