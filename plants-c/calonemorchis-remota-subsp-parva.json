    "intro": "Calonemorchis remota subsp. parva, commonly known as the small remote calonemorchis, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and unique floral structure, which are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous or forested areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, contributing to its overall compact appearance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
