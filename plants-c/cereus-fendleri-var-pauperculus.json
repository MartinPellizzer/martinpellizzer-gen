    "intro": "Cereus fendleri var. pauperculus, commonly known as the \"Moon Cactus,\" is a low-growing cactus species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem with spiny areoles and produces showy, night-blooming flowers in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in well-draining soil with minimal water. It is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and ease of care. Despite its common name, it is not a true cactus but a type of euphorbia, which contributes to its distinctive features."
