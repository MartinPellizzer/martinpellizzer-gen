    "intro": "Catapodium loliaceum var. balearicum, commonly known as the Balearic catapodium, is a perennial grass native to the Balearic Islands. It features slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that grow close to the ground, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in coastal and sandy environments, often found in dunes and rocky areas. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to saline and arid conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
