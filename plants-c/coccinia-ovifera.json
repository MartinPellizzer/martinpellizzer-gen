    "intro": "Coccinia ovifera, commonly known as the ovalleaf false cucumber, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and squash, and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are often used in local cuisines. Botanically, it is distinguished by its tendrils, which aid in climbing, and its presence of both male and female flowers on the same plant. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common species in humid, lowland environments."
