It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. It is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in environments with low moisture availability. This variant is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in desert and steppe ecosystems."
