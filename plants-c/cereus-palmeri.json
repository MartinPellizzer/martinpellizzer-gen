It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring a tall, spiny stem and a crown of yellow flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Its flowers are pollinated by moths, which are active during the evening. Cereus palmeri is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun."
