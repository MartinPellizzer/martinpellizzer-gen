    "intro": "Cantua breviflora, commonly known as the cushion flower, is a perennial plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette of silver-gray leaves that form a compact cushion-like structure. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and conservation efforts."
