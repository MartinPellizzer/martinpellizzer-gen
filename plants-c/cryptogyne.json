    "intro": "Cryptogyne, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic flowering plants that belong to the family Nychthemeralaceae. These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that open at night. Cryptogyne species are typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. Their roots anchor them to the substrate, while their leaves provide a surface for aquatic life. The flowers of Cryptogyne are pollinated by nocturnal insects, which is an adaptation to their nighttime blooming cycle."
