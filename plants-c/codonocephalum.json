It is characterized by its striking, butterfly-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are usually palmately lobed, and the flowers are borne in clusters at the ends of the stems.
