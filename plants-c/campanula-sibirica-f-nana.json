    "intro": "Campanula sibirica f. nana, commonly known as the Siberian bellflower dwarf form, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It features upright stems with clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with small, dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover in alpine settings. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate flowers and low maintenance requirements."
