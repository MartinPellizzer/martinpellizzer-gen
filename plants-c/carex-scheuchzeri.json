    "intro": "Carex scheuchzeri, commonly known as the Alpine sedge, is a perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountain meadows and rocky areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Carex scheuchzeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine environments."
