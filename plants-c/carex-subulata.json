    "intro": "Carex subulata, commonly known as the needleleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, pointed leaves that are typically a dark green color. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of flowers that are usually greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Carex subulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
