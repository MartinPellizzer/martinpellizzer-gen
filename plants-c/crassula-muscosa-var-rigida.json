It features compact, fleshy leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
