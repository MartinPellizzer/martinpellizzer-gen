    "intro": "Cereus neotetragonus, commonly known as the four-angled cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are ribbed and often have a four-angled cross-section. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and collectors."
