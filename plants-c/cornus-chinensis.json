    "intro": "Cornus chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its white or pinkish flowers that appear in clusters, typically in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly serrated edge. Cornus chinensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
