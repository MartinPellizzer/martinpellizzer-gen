It features delicate, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few inches, making it ideal for rock gardens or borders. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are evergreen in mild climates. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and is relatively low maintenance once established."
