    "intro": "Canthium myrtifolium, commonly known as the redroot sida, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Canthium myrtifolium is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
