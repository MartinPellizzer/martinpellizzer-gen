    "intro": "Crotalaria triantha, commonly known as the three-lobed crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features striking yellow flowers with distinctive spurred petals, and its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets. Crotalaria triantha is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in semi-arid environments. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
