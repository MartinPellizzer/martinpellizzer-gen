    "intro": "Carduncellus confusa, commonly known as the confused carduncellus, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive composite flower heads, which consist of both ray and disk flowers, typical of the daisy family. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is found in specific regions of southern Europe. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
