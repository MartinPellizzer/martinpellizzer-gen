    "intro": "Cupressus bakeri subsp. mathewsii, commonly known as the Mathews' cedar, is a rare and endangered subspecies native to the western United States. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in mountainous regions, often at high elevations. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically important for conservation efforts in its native range."
