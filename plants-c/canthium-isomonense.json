    "intro": "Canthium isomonense, commonly known as the African spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its milky sap and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with smooth, often hairy stems and alternate leaves. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Canthium isomonense is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and woodland edges."
