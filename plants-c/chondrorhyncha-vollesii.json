It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves and intricate, fragrant flower spikes that bloom in shades of yellow and green. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, enhancing nutrient uptake. The flowers are pollinated primarily by specific species of bees and moths, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
