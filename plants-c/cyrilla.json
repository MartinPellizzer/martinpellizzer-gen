    "intro": "Cyrilla, commonly known as the sweetshrub, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lythraceae. It consists of several species, most notably Cyrilla lutea and Cyrilla racemosa, which are native to the southeastern United States. These shrubs typically grow in wetlands and swampy areas, exhibiting a preference for moist, acidic soils. Their leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy texture, while their flowers are small, clustered, and usually pink or red in color. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, contributing to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
