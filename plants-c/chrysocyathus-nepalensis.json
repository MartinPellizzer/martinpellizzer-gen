    "intro": "Chrysocyathus nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal golden cup, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of Nepal. It belongs to the family Cyathaceae and is characterized by its unique, cup-shaped inflorescence that holds small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its botanical features include hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help it adapt to its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, Chrysocyathus nepalensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
