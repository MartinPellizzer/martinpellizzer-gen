    "intro": "Cakile maritima var. sessiliflora, commonly known as the seaside rockcress, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the western coast of the United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure and succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid, salty environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is adapted to stabilize sandy or rocky soils, making it a common pioneer species in coastal dunes. The sessile leaves, which are attached directly to the stem without a petiole, are a distinguishing feature of this variety."
