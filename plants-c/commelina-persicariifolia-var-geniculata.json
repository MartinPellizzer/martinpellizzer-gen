    "intro": "Commelina persicariifolia var. geniculata, commonly known as the creeping spiderwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, striking blue or violet flowers with three petals and a distinctive three-lobed calyx. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
