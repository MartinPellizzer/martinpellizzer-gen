    "intro": "Catalpa syringifolia var. pulverulenta, commonly known as the powdered catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are heart-shaped with a velvety texture and a distinctive powdery bloom, giving it its common name. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in USDA hardiness zones 5 through 9. It produces long, bean-like pods that contain seeds dispersed by wind."
