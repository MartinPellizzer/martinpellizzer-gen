    "intro": "Cyclosorus triphyllus, commonly known as the three-leaved water clover, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating on the surface of freshwater habitats. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is often found in ponds, streams, and wetlands. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for microorganisms. Cyclosorus triphyllus is primarily found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
