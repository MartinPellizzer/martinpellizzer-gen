    "intro": "Cleistocactus baumannii subsp. baumannii, commonly known as the \"Percival's cactus,\" is a species of cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico. It is a small, columnar cactus with a ribbed stem that typically grows to a height of about 15 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces flowers that are usually yellow or orange, which bloom in the evening and remain closed during the day, a characteristic known as cleistogamy. It has a dense covering of spines and is adapted to arid environments with minimal rainfall. This subspecies is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry conditions."
