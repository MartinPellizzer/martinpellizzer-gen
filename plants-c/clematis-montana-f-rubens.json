    "intro": "Clematis montana f. rubens, commonly known as the redflower Clematis, is a vigorous climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It features showy, semi-double to double red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound, trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and a trailing habit that makes it suitable for trellises or arches. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
