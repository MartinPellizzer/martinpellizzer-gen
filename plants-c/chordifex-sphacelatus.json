It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland and swampy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
