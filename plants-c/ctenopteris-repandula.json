    "intro": "Ctenopteris repandula, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sea holly, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often arched or curled. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, thriving in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the undersides of the fronds. Ctenopteris repandula is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
