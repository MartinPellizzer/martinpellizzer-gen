    "intro": "Cenchrus anomoplexis, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, which help it thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain minute, wind-dispersed seeds. Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it drought-tolerant. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is used in some regions for forage or erosion control."
