It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in spring and early summer. Its root system has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it valuable for soil enrichment. Coronilla hirta is often used as a cover crop and in traditional herbal medicine."
