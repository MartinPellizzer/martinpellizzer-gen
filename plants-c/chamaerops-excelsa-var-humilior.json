    "intro": "Chamaerops excelsa var. humilior, commonly known as the dwarf date palm, is a compact, cold-hardy palm native to the Canary Islands. It features a slender trunk with a crown of narrow, feather-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, edible dates in clusters, though its fruiting is less prolific compared to other date palm varieties. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value and resilience make it a popular choice for landscaping in mild climates."
