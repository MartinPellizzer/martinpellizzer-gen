It features a rosette of dark green, spoon-shaped leaves that are often curly and crisp. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its leaves are edible and can be used in salads or cooked like other chicory species."
