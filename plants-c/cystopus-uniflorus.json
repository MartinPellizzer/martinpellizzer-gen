    "intro": "Cystopus uniflorus, commonly known as the single-flower bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient absorption. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, often blooming in late spring or early summer. Despite its simple appearance, Cystopus uniflorus plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
