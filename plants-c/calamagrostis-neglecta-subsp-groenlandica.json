    "intro": "Calamagrostis neglecta subsp. groenlandica, commonly known as Arctic grass or Greenland sedge, is a perennial grass species native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Its ability to tolerate extreme cold makes it an important component of Arctic ecosystems."
