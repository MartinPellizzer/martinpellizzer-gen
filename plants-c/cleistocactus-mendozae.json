    "intro": "Cleistocactus mendozae, commonly known as the Mendoza's close-cactus, is a rare cactus species native to the Andes mountains of Argentina. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white to pale green spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that open only at night, a feature known as nyctinasty. It thrives in high-altitude environments with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
