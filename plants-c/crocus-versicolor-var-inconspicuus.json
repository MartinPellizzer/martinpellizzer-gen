    "intro": "Crocus versicolor var. inconspicuus, commonly known as the pale crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It produces delicate, early spring flowers with pale yellow to white petals and a greenish center. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its subtle floral display. This variety is less showy than other crocus species, hence its common name."
