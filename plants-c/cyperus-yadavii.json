    "intro": "Cyperus yadavii, commonly known as Indian papyrus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its cylindrical, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically found in clusters at the base of the stems. It thrives in wet or marshy environments, often growing in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams. Cyperus yadavii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
