    "intro": "Clerodendrum venosum, commonly known as the veiny clerodendrum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by distinctive, woody, orange-red berries. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The plant is also valued in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and showy flowers."
