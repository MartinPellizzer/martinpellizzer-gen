    "intro": "Crucianella spicata, commonly known as the clustered sea bean, is a small, perennial shrub native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bean-like fruits that are typically green to brown in color. The plant has small, narrow leaves and produces yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in coastal restoration projects."
