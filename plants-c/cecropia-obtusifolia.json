    "intro": "Cecropia obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved cecropia, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are grouped in clusters, followed by winged seeds dispersed by wind. Cecropia obtusifolia is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is often found in disturbed habitats such as forest edges and clearings. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
