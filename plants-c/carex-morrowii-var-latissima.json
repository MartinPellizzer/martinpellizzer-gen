    "intro": "Carex morrowii var. latissima, commonly known as the broadleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage, which consists of narrow, grass-green leaves that are broader than those of typical sedges. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments."
