It features slender, arching stems covered in small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being narrow and slightly hairy. This variety is characterized by its pale green stems and foliage, distinguishing it from the more common Cytisus scoparius. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats."
