    "intro": "Cherleria yukonensis, commonly known as Yukon stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to the Yukon region of Canada. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Cherleria yukonensis is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in cold climates."
