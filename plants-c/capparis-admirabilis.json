It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring thorny stems and dark green, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers, which are followed by edible, greenish-yellow berries. These berries are often used in culinary applications, particularly in Indian and Middle Eastern cuisines. The plant's botanical characteristics make it both ornamental and useful in traditional medicine and gastronomy."
