    "intro": "Castilleja pallida var. camporum, commonly known as the Campers' paintbrush, is a species of hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and shrublands, often in association with other flowering plants. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it relies on host plants for some of its nutritional needs. The species is noted for its ecological importance in supporting pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
