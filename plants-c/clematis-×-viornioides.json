    "intro": "Clematis \u00d7 viornioides, commonly known as the Japanese clematis, is a vigorous climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, often with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its rapid growth and ornamental value, it is popular in gardens but can be invasive if not properly managed."
