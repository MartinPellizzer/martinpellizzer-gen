    "intro": "Campanula velutina var. rifana, commonly known as the Rifan bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of North Africa. It features upright stems covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive tactile texture. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a slightly hairy surface and a waxy coating, adapting to arid and rocky environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
