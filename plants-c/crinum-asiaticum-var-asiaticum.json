    "intro": "Crinum asiaticum var. asiaticum, commonly known as the Asian lily or Asiatic lily, is a striking ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant features narrow, strap-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and it blooms during the summer months. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its vibrant blooms and is often cultivated in gardens and as a cut flower."
