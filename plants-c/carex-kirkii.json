It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, three-ranked flowers, which are wind-pollinated.
