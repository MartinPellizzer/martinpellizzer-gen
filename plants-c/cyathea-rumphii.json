    "intro": "Cyathea rumphii, commonly known as the Rumph's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is typically found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting its tall stature and enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Cyathea rumphii plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to forest biodiversity."
