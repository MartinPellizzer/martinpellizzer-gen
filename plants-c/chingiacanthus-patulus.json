The plant exhibits a distinct growth habit with a woody stem and broad, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically displaying a combination of yellow and green hues. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Chingiacanthus patulus is considered a conservation concern."
