    "intro": "Crataegus \u00d7 raavadensis, commonly known as the hybrid hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree that belongs to the Rosaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Crataegus monogyna (common hawthorn) and Crataegus laevigata (smooth hawthorn), resulting in a plant with a combination of traits from both parents. The leaves are typically oval to ovate, with serrated edges, and the plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in the spring. It is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils, and its fruit, a small red berry, is an important food source for birds and other wildlife."
