    "intro": "Cymopterus glomeratus var. fendleri, commonly known as the desert bluebells, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and compound umbels of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements. Its leaves are finely divided and often have a fern-like appearance, while its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and slightly different flower coloration compared to the typical form of Cymopterus glomeratus."
