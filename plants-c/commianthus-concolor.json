It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and dark green, with a slightly hairy underside. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often with a violet or purple throat. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is favored by gardeners seeking both beauty and resilience in their landscapes."
