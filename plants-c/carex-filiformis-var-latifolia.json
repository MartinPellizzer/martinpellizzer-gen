    "intro": "Carex filiformis var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are broader than the typical filiformis variety, often reaching lengths of up to 30 cm. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike that bears small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
