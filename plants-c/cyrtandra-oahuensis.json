    "intro": "Cyrtandra oahuensis, commonly known as the Oahu cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Oahu. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and rocky crevices. It has hairy leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
