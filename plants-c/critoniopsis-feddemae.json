It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its small, violet-colored flowers and heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, limestone-rich soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected under local conservation laws. Its unique botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
