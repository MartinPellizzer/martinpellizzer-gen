    "intro": "Cynorkis castillonii, commonly known as the Castillon's orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its rocky, well-drained habitat. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette near the base of the plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cynorkis castillonii is considered a vulnerable species in conservation status."
