    "intro": "Cheirostylis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that resemble the shape of a ghostly face, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on tree branches or rocks, relying on epiphytic growth rather than soil. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with intricate, lip-like structures that aid in pollination. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, Cheirostylis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
