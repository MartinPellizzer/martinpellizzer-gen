    "intro": "Cypripedium niveum, commonly known as the white lady's tresses, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that resemble a truss of hair. The plant typically grows in cool, shaded environments with moist, well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cypripedium niveum is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
