    "intro": "Cousinia atrobracteata, commonly known as the black bract cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of purple to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its stems are usually hairy as well. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Cousinia atrobracteata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil."
