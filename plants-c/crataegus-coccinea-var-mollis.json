It is characterized by its smooth, pale pink to red flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces red, fleshy fruits called pomes, which are typically eaten by birds and small mammals. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins, and the bark is grayish-brown and fissured. This variety is valued for its ornamental value and ecological benefits in supporting wildlife."
