    "intro": "Coulteria, commonly known as the \"false arum,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. These plants are characterized by their striking, often colorful inflorescences that consist of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Coulteria species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Their leaves are usually arrow-shaped and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens."
