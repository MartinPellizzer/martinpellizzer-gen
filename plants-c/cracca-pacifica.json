    "intro": "Cracca pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific cracca, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shores, where it thrives in salty and windy conditions. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and it blooms from late spring to early fall. Cracca pacifica plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing coastal dunes."
