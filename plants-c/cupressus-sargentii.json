    "intro": "Cupressus sargentii, commonly known as the Sargent's cypress, is a species of coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender form and dense, scale-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
