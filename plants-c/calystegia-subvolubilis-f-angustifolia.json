    "intro": "Calystegia subvolubilis f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf morning glory, is a variant of the morning glory family (Convolvulaceae). It is characterized by its slender, vine-like growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are narrower than those of the typical species. The flowers are trumpet-shaped, typically pale blue to purple, and bloom in the early morning. This form is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners, though it can be invasive in some regions."
