It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble those of the true lotus. The plant typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of hair. The flowers, which can be pink, white, or red, bloom in late summer and early autumn, attracting various pollinators."
