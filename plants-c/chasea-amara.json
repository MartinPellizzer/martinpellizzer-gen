    "intro": "Chasea amara, commonly known as bitter panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland habitats, including marshes and prairies, and is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding. Due to its bitter taste, it is generally avoided by grazing animals, which helps it persist in competitive environments."
