    "intro": "Calyptranthes mexicana, commonly known as Mexican beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southern United States. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. These flowers are followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but not for humans. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and unique fruiting display."
