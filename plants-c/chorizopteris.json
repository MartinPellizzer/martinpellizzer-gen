    "intro": "Chorizopteris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, often finely divided fronds that are typically found growing on rocky substrates. The plants are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on rocks or other surfaces without soil. Chorizopteris species are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in tropical and subtropical climates. Their botanical significance lies in their unique adaptations to harsh environments and their role in ecological studies of plant resilience."
