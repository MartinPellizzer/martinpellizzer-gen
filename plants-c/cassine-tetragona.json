    "intro": "Cassine tetragona, commonly known as the four-angle cassine, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its rough, ridged bark and opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by four-angled, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Cassine tetragona is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
