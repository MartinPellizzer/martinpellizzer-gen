    "intro": "Corymbia brachycarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited bloodwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that often appears flaky or peeling. The tree produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically pale pink to cream in color. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds, and the leaves are narrow and lance-shaped. This species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and heat."
