    "intro": "Comptonella lactea var. lactea, commonly known as the milkweed vine, is a climbing plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, typical of the Apocynaceae family. Its milky sap, which is latex-like, is a distinguishing feature and can be toxic if ingested. This species is often found in rocky or sandy soils in arid environments."
