It is native to Ethiopia and grows at high altitudes in mountainous regions. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds used for coffee. It is a shrub that typically reaches heights of up to 3 meters. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
