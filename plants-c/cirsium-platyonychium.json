    "intro": "Cirsium platyonychium, commonly known as the broad-nail thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Its foliage is covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
