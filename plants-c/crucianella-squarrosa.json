    "intro": "Crucianella squarrosa, commonly known as the hairy sea bean, is a small, evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by bean-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to saline and coastal environments. Crucianella squarrosa is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes."
