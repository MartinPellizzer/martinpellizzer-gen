    "intro": "Cystopteris grandis, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant has a distinctive, shield-shaped structure at the base of its fronds, which is a key identifying feature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
