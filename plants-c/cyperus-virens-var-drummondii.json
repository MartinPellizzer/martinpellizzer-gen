    "intro": "Cyperus virens var. drummondii, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 inch wide, with a dark green color and a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale blue to purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical structure makes it well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments."
