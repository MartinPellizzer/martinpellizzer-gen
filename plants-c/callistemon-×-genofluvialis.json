    "intro": "Callistemon \u00d7 genofluvialis, commonly known as the hybrid bottlebrush, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Callistemon citrinus and Callistemon viminalis. It is a small to medium-sized shrub characterized by its striking, brush-like inflorescences that range in color from red to orange. The plant is native to Australia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to a variety of growing conditions. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, providing a nice contrast to the vibrant flower spikes."
