    "intro": "Cucumis melo subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy melon, is a subspecies of the melon plant characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family and is native to regions of Africa and southern Asia. The plant produces fruits that are typically smaller and more elongated compared to other melon varieties. Its leaves are broad and lobed, with a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. The hairy melon is valued for its edible fruit, which has a mild, sweet flavor and is often used in local cuisines."
