    "intro": "Ceropteris flexilis, commonly known as the flexible water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often used in ornamental horticulture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in humid forests. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spores rather than seeds. Ceropteris flexilis is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in water gardens or as a decorative plant in shaded areas."
