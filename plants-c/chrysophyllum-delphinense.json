    "intro": "Chrysophyllum delphinense, commonly known as the Delphin's starfruit, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces edible, yellow-orange fruits that are similar in appearance to starfruit, though they are typically smaller and less aromatic. It thrives in well-drained, fertile soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is cultivated in some tropical regions for both aesthetic and culinary purposes."
