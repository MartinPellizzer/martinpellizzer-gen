    "intro": "Chuquiraga varians, commonly known as the Andean burr or chuquiraga, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces distinctive, spiky bracts that enclose its small, yellowish flowers, which are often mistaken for the plant itself. Its leaves are typically alternate, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the high-altitude environment. Chuquiraga varians is often found in rocky or coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
