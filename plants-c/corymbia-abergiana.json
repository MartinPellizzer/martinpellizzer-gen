    "intro": "Corymbia abergiana, commonly known as the Abergian red gum, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the coastal regions of southern Queensland, Australia. The tree is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. It produces small, fragrant white flowers clustered in spikes, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. The wood of Corymbia abergiana is hard and durable, making it valuable for timber and fuel."
