    "intro": "Chiridium verticillatum, commonly known as the clustered milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woods or along stream banks. Chiridium verticillatum plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
