It is characterized by its narrow, sickle-shaped leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain flat, seed-like structures. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Cassia angustifolia is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal."
