It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to ovate leaves, and showy white to pink flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Crataegus callicarpa is often found in open woodlands, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas, and it is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
