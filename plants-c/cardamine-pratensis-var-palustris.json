    "intro": "Cardamine pratensis var. palustris, commonly known as marsh watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in Europe and Asia. It features slender, often hairy stems that grow from a rhizomatous root system, and its leaves are alternate, with a heart-shaped base and a serrated margin. The plant produces small, white or greenish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It is often found in peat bogs and along the edges of ponds and streams."
