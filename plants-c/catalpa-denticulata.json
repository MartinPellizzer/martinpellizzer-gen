    "intro": "Catalpa denticulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically 5 to 10 inches long and have a finely toothed margin. The tree produces showy, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by long, bean-like pods. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Catalpa denticulata is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland areas."
