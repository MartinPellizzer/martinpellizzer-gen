    "intro": "Copiapoa taltalensis subsp. desertorum, commonly known as the Taltal cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is a columnar cactus with a tall, cylindrical stem that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. It is adapted to extreme aridity, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. This subspecies is relatively rare and is often found in rocky soils at high elevations."
