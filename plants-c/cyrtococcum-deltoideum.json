    "intro": "Cyrtococcum deltoideum, commonly known as the delta cup lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinctive, leaf-like structure with a bright green to yellowish-green upper surface and a pale, whitish underside. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungal partner, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the environment. It is typically found on tree trunks and branches in temperate regions. Its slow growth and specialized habitat make it an indicator species for forest health."
