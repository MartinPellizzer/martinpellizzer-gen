    "intro": "Conceveiba pleiostemona, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is typically found in moist, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered an invasive species in many areas."
