    "intro": "Ceropegia keithii subsp. carnosa, commonly known as the Ghost Plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, trailing stems with small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces delicate, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, attracting specific pollinators like moths. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
