    "intro": "Campanula tristis, commonly known as the weeping bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its drooping clusters of pale blue or white bell-shaped flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Campanula tristis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
