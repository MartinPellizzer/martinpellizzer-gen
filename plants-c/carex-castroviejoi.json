    "intro": "Carex castroviejoi, commonly known as the Castroviejo sedge, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. This plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats, often in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its leaves are grass-like, with a distinctive dark green color and a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of many sedges."
