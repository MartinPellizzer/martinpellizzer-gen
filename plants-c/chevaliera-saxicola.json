    "intro": "Chevaliera saxicola, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in rocky and arid environments. It is a composite organism formed by a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. This plant is typically found on exposed rock surfaces, where it can absorb moisture from the air. Its slow growth rate makes it a long-lived species, often surviving for decades or even centuries. Chevaliera saxicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms in harsh environments."
