    "intro": "Catalpa purpurea, commonly known as the southern catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The tree produces long, bean-like pods that contain sticky, toxic seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Catalpa purpurea is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and historical significance."
