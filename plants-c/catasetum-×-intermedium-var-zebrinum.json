    "intro": "Catasetum \u00d7 intermedium var. zebrinum, commonly known as the zebra orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, striped petals that resemble a zebra's coat, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. It produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with a distinctive lip that is adorned with intricate patterns. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining, loose soil to support its growth."
