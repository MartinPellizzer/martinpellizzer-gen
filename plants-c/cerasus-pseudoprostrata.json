    "intro": "Cerasus pseudoprostrata, commonly known as the Japanese apricot, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It features small, oval leaves that are usually reddish-brown underneath, and it produces delicate, fragrant flowers in the spring. The plant is notable for its edible fruits, which are similar in taste to apricots but often have a more acidic flavor. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun for optimal growth. Cerasus pseudoprostrata is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and cultural significance in traditional gardens."
