It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny capsules containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or dry woodland habitats. Due to its unique foliage and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a decorative plant."
