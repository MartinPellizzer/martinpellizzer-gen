    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum delitescens, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, white, ephemeral flowers that bloom briefly and fade quickly, giving it its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are thin and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the humid air. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is considered critically endangered in its natural range."
