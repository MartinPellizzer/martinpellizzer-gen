    "intro": "Clidemia francavillana, commonly known as the Hawaiian snowberry, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its small, white or pinkish flowers and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is often found in the understory of native forests. It produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species, contributing to its role in local ecosystems. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside Hawaii, where it can outcompete native vegetation."
