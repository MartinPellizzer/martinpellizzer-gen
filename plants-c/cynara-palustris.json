    "intro": "Cynara palustris, commonly known as the swamp artichoke, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas of Europe and western Asia. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family, which are followed by spiky, bristly fruit structures. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found near ponds, ditches, and marshes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
