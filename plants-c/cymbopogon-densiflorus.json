    "intro": "Cymbopogon densiflorus, commonly known as narrowleaf lemon grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant is often cultivated for its aromatic oils, which are extracted from its leaves and used in perfumes and culinary applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Cymbopogon densiflorus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
