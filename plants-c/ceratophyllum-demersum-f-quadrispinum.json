    "intro": "Ceratophyllum demersum f. quadrispinum, commonly known as the spiked water-chestnut, is a submerged aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and its distinctive, spiny stems that give it its common name. The plant has small, bright green leaves that are opposite in arrangement and often appear in clusters. It produces tiny, white flowers that are typically hidden within the foliage, and it is often used in ponds and water gardens for its ornamental value and ability to control algae. This fern-like plant is also valued for its role in aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
