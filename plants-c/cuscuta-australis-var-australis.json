    "intro": "Cuscuta australis var. australis, commonly known as the Australian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to Australia and is often found growing on a variety of plants, including shrubs and trees. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to spread to new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to its host plants, affecting their growth and health."
