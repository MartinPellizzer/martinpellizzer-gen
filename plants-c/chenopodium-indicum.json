    "intro": "Chenopodium indicum, commonly known as lambsquarters, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Amaranthaceae family. It is characterized by its alternate, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs and can vary in color from light green to reddish. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers that develop into dry, three-angled fruits containing single seeds. It is native to temperate regions of the Old World but has been naturalized in many parts of the globe. Chenopodium indicum is often considered a weed but is also used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some cultures."
