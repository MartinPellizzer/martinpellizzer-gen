    "intro": "Cyathea bulligera, commonly known as the Bullinger's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer. The plant has large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length, with a distinctive, elongated shape. Cyathea bulligera thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along riverbanks. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture."
