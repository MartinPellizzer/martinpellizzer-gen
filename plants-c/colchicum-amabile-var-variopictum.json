    "intro": "Colchicum amabile var. variopictum, commonly known as the Variable Autumn Crocus, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with purple or red. Its unique floral structure includes a spurred petal that houses the nectar, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its dramatic fall bloom."
