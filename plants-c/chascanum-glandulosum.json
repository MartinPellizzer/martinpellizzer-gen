    "intro": "Chascanum glandulosum, commonly known as the sticky nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its glandular hairs that give it a sticky texture, which can deter herbivores. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or arid regions. Its berries are toxic and should not be consumed by humans or animals."
