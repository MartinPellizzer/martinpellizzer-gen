    "intro": "Caconapea debilis, commonly known as the weak cat's claw, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers. The plant has slender, climbing stems and is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, Caconapea debilis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
