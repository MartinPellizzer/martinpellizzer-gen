    "intro": "Cyphokentia savoryana, commonly known as the Savory's cycad, is a species of cycad native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with the female cones being larger and more elongated than the male ones. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires a warm, tropical climate to flourish. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
