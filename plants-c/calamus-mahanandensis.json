    "intro": "Calamus mahanandensis, commonly known as the Mahananda reed, is a member of the Arecaceae family, characterized by its tall, slender stems and pinnate leaves. It is native to the wetlands and marshy areas of northeastern India, particularly in the states of Assam and West Bengal. The plant is notable for its aromatic rhizomes, which are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. Its growth habit is clump-forming, with long, narrow leaves that can reach several meters in length. The species plays an important ecological role in its habitat by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
