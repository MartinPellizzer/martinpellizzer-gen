    "intro": "Crinum veneficium, commonly known as the death lily, is a striking plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can range in color from white to purple. The plant produces strap-like, sword-shaped leaves and has a bulbous underground stem. Crinum veneficium contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals if ingested. Its ornamental value is often balanced by its cautionary reputation in horticulture."
