    "intro": "Cordia glomerata, commonly known as the clustered cottonwood, is a deciduous tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often gland-dotted. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in coastal and riverine habitats, often forming dense thickets. Cordia glomerata is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical uses in traditional medicine."
