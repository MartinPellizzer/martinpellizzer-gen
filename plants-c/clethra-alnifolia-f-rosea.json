    "intro": "Clethra alnifolia f. rosea, commonly known as the Roseleaf sweet pepper bush, is a cultivar of the sweet pepper bush, native to eastern North America. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from both its fragrant blossoms and its colorful berries."
