    "intro": "Chaetolepis nana, commonly known as the dwarf chaetolepis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in cold, nutrient-poor environments. The plant has a low, mat-forming growth habit with numerous short, stiff stems. Its small, spoon-shaped leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs that help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the short growing season of summer."
