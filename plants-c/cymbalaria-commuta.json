    "intro": "Cymbalaria commuta, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and has small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring. It is typically found in moist, calcareous soils in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Cymbalaria commuta is an important plant in ecological studies due to its role in supporting pollinators and its adaptability to various environmental conditions."
