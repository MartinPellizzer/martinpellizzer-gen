    "intro": "Carex minutiflora, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy, with a dense cluster of small, inconspicuous flowers at the base of the plant. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Carex minutiflora is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
