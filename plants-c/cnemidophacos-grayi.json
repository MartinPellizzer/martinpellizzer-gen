    "intro": "Cnemidophacos grayi, commonly known as the gray's knotted liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, mat-forming liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has a distinctive morphology with a thallus that is often lobed and covered in minute, rhizoidal structures. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a simple, flattened body that absorbs water and nutrients directly from the environment. Cnemidophacos grayi is adapted to thrive in humid, temperate climates and is often found in regions with high rainfall and cool temperatures."
