    "intro": "Cicerbita muralis subsp. gaditana, commonly known as the Iberian bittercress, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open areas or along roadsides. It has heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The species is noted for its peppery taste, which is due to the presence of glucosinolates, compounds common in the Brassicaceae family."
