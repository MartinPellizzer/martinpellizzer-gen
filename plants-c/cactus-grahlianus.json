    "intro": "Cactus grahlianus, commonly known as the golden hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem covered in dense, spiny areoles, which provide protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to drought conditions. The plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
