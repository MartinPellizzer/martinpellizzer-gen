    "intro": "Cardamine hirsuta var. intermedia, commonly known as the hairy watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features alternate, palmately lobed leaves with a distinctive hairy texture, which helps it retain moisture in damp conditions. Its small, white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early spring. The species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
