    "intro": "Cardamine resedifolia var. dacica, commonly known as the alpine watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of pinnately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in moist, rocky environments and is often found in mountainous regions."
