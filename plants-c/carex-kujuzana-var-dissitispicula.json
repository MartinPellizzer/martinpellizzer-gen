    "intro": "Carex kujuzana var. dissitispicula, commonly known as the scattered spike sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a smooth or slightly rough texture. This variant is distinguished by its loosely arranged spikelets, which give it a distinctive appearance compared to other Carex species."
