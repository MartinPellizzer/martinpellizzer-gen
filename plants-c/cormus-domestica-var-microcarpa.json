    "intro": "Cormus domestica var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf cormus, is a lesser-known variant of the cormus plant. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more delicate foliage compared to the standard cormus. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often used in ornamental gardening. Its botanical features include a rhizomatous root system and narrow, grass-like leaves. This variety is valued for its unique appearance and suitability for small garden spaces."
