It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in wet meadows, stream edges, and ponds. The plant has small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, appearing in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, narrow, and often submerged or floating, aiding in photosynthesis in aquatic environments. This variety is noted for its delicate appearance and its role in supporting aquatic ecosystems."
