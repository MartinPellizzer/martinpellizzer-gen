    "intro": "Cryptantha longifolia, commonly known as the longflower cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and the flowers bloom in early spring. Cryptantha longifolia is often found in open grasslands and along the edges of shrublands."
