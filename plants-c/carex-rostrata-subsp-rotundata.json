    "intro": "Carex rostrata subsp. rotundata, commonly known as the round-leaved sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, cylindrical leaves that are typically green and often have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually brown or reddish in color, which are its reproductive structures. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. This subspecies is notable for its compact growth habit and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
