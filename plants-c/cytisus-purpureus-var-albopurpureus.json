    "intro": "Cytisus purpureus var. albopurpureus, commonly known as the pale purple broom, is a flowering shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant produces pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats such as hillsides and grasslands. This variety is distinguished by its pale purple flower color, which sets it apart from the typical red or orange hues of other cytisus species."
