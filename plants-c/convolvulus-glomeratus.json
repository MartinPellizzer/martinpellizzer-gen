    "intro": "Convolvulus glomeratus, commonly known as the clustered bindweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its trailing stems and small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its rapid growth and aggressive spreading habit make it a common weed in agricultural and disturbed areas."
