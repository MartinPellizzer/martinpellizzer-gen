    "intro": "Carex rigidifolia, commonly known as rigid false couch grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its stiff, upright flowering stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-brown spikes. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Carex rigidifolia is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
