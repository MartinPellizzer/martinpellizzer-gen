    "intro": "Corrigiola litoralis, commonly known as sea lentils, is a small, herbaceous plant that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and can withstand salt spray and strong winds. Corrigiola litoralis is often found in dunes and along shorelines, playing a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
