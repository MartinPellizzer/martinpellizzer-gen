    "intro": "Cerastium vulgatum var. brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically shorter and broader than those of the typical species, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its hairy stems and compact growth habit make it well adapted to cool, temperate climates."
