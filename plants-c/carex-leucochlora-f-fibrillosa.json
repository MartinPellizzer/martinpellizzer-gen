    "intro": "Carex leucochlora f. fibrillosa, commonly known as the fibrous white sedge, is a variant of the white sedge species native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. The fibrous texture of its leaves is a distinguishing feature of this particular form."
