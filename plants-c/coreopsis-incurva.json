    "intro": "Coreopsis incurva, commonly known as the curly coreopsis, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers with prominent white centers, blooming from late spring to early fall. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a slight curl, contributing to its common name. Coreopsis incurva is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for native gardens."
