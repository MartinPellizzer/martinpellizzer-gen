    "intro": "Castilleja foliolosa, commonly known as the leafy owl's-eye, is a hemiparasitic plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family. It is native to the western United States and grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. The plant has a slender, leafy stem with small, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking red-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. It forms symbiotic relationships with certain host plants, drawing nutrients through its haustoria. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
