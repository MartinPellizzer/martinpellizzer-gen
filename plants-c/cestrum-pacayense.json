    "intro": "Cestrum pacayense, commonly known as the pacayense nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in regions of Peru and Ecuador. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, with woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds. Cestrum pacayense is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some indigenous cultures."
