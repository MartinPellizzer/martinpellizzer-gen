    "intro": "Croton minimimarginiglandulosus, commonly known as the narrow-margin glandular croton, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves with narrow margins and glandular structures, which are often covered in tiny, oil-producing bumps. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, well-drained soils. Its small, clustered flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
