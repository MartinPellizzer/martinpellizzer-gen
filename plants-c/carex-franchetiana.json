    "intro": "Carex franchetiana, commonly known as the Franchet's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. Native to parts of East Asia, particularly China, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or swampy areas. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
