It features small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for gardeners in Mediterranean climates."
