    "intro": "Coccoloba colonensis, commonly known as the West Indian beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal areas and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are a striking feature of the species. These berries are edible for some animals but are generally not consumed by humans due to their bitter taste. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
