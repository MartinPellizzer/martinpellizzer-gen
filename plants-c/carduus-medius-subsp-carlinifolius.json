    "intro": "Carduus medius subsp. carlinifolius, commonly known as the Carline thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and a distinctive yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is also noted for its medicinal properties, with historical use in traditional remedies."
