    "intro": "Casearia grewiifolia, commonly known as the West Indian beautyberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant produces bright blue berries that are edible for humans and birds but are often considered toxic to livestock. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a smooth texture with a slightly glossy appearance. Casearia grewiifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique fruit."
