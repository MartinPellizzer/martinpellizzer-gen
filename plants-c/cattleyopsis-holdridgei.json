    "intro": "Cattleyopsis holdridgei, commonly known as the Holdridge cattleya, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, brightly colored blooms in shades of white, yellow, and orange, which appear during the warmer months. It thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, making it a challenging species for cultivation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cattleyopsis holdridgei is considered a species of conservation concern."
