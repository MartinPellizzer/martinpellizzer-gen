    "intro": "Cheilanthes mac, commonly known as the Mac's rockcap, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. Native to arid and rocky environments, this plant is well adapted to drought conditions. The fronds are typically pinnately compound, with small, ovate leaflets arranged along the central axis. It is often found in crevices and on rock surfaces, where it thrives in low-nutrient, well-drained soils."
