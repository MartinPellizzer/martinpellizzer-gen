    "intro": "Catasetum expansum, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can range in color from yellow to orange and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shady environments. Its flowers have a unique structure with specialized pollination mechanisms, including a modified lip that aids in pollinator attraction. The plant thrives in warm, moist conditions and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
