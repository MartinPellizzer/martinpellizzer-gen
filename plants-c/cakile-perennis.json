    "intro": "Cakile perennis, commonly known as the perennial sandspurry, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with fleshy, lobed leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, allowing it to spread in disturbed or dry environments. Cakile perennis is often found in coastal dunes, roadsides, and other arid habitats."
