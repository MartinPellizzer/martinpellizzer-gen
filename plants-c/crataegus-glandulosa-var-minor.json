    "intro": "Crataegus glandulosa var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features thorned branches, which are a notable botanical characteristic. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated margins, and are often covered in small glands, giving it its scientific name. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and open habitats."
