    "intro": "Cleome tunarensis, commonly known as the tropical spider flower, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, spindly stems and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that resemble spider legs. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Cleome tunarensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
