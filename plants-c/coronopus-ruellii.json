    "intro": "Coronopus ruellii, commonly known as the velvetleaf or common coronopus, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Leguminosae, also known as the Fabaceae family, which includes many nitrogen-fixing plants. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Coronopus ruellii is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential ecological and medicinal properties."
