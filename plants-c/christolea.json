    "intro": "Christolea, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are herbaceous perennials native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal rosettes of leaves and produce small, yellowish flowers that develop into fluffy seed heads. They are often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. Christolea species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
