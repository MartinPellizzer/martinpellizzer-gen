    "intro": "Cyperus alopecuroides var. digynus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its grass-like appearance. It features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically greenish or brownish in color. This variety is native to regions of Southeast Asia and is often found in wet or moist soils, such as marshes and floodplains. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
