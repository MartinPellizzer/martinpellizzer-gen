    "intro": "Colymbada amblensis, commonly known as the swamp mistflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, erect stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating. Its small, white flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences and bloom during the summer months. Colymbada amblensis plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and provides habitat for various aquatic insects."
