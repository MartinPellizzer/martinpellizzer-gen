    "intro": "Carex moniliformis, commonly known as the beadgrasses, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. The plant thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. The inflorescence consists of two distinct spikelets, with the lower one being longer and more robust."
