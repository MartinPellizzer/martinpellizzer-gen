    "intro": "Cousinia intertexta var. floccosa, commonly known as the silky fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in dry climates."
