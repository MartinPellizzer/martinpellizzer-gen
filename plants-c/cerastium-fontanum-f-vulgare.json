    "intro": "Cerastium fontanum f. vulgare, commonly known as the common mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that bear small, hairy, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its delicate appearance and rapid growth make it a common weed in gardens and disturbed soils."
