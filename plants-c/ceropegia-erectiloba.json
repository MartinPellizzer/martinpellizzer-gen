It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit, with slender, succulent stems that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale green, often with a distinctive waxy coating. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique appearance.
