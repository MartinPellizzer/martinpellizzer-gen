    "intro": "Chasmanthium laxum subsp. sessiliflorum, commonly known as the sessileflower bluegrass, is a low-growing, clump-forming grass native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and have a fine texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to lavender flowers, which are clustered closely together. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
