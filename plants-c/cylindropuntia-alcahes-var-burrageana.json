    "intro": "Cylindropuntia alcahes var. burrageana, commonly known as the Burrageana cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in clusters of small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny structure. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a hardy plant for desert landscapes. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with multiple stems forming a dense, branching structure."
