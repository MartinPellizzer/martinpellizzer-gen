It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are alternate and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
