    "intro": "Colchicum macrophyllum, commonly known as the giant autumn crocus, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy purple or violet flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its bulbs contain toxic compounds, including colchicine, which has been historically used in medicine. Due to its striking appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
