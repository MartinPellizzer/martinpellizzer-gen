    "intro": "Cerastium fasciculatum, commonly known as the clustered mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy, often pink or white flowers. The plant features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. Its leaves are spoon-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Cerastium fasciculatum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
