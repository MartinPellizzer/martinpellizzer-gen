    "intro": "Cladocarpa waimeaensis, commonly known as the Waimea sandalwood, is a rare and endemic species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Rutaceae family, characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mesic forests, and is adapted to the unique climate of Hawaii. Its wood was historically valued for its fragrance and used in traditional Hawaiian craftsmanship. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered critically endangered."
