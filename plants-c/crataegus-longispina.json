    "intro": "Crataegus longispina, commonly known as the longspine hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny branches, which are often long and slender, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by red berries in the fall. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges, and they turn yellow or red in autumn. Crataegus longispina is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight."
