    "intro": "Chrysothamnus oreophilus, commonly known as the silverleaf goldenbush, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky soils and arid environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in dry landscapes."
