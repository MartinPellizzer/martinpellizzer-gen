    "intro": "Carthamus africanus, commonly known as African safflower, is an annual herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect stem and bright yellow flower heads that resemble those of the common safflower. The plant produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its natural distribution. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers consist of both ray and disk florets. Carthamus africanus is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun conditions."
