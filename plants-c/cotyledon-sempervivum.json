    "intro": "Cotyledon sempervivum, commonly known as the \"Jubilee Plant,\" is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red during the growing season. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, providing structural support and maximizing sunlight absorption. Cotyledon sempervivum is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
