    "intro": "Coryphopteris pectiniformis var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf holly fern. It is a fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in the Philippines. This plant is characterized by its distinctive, pinnately divided, hirsute (hairy) fronds that give it a unique texture. The fronds are typically bright green and can grow quite large, often reaching lengths of up to 1 meter. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate moisture and indirect light."
