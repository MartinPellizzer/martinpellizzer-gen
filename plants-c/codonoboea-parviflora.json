    "intro": "Codonoboea parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered codonopsis, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweeds and other ornamental plants. The plant is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It produces small, round berries that contain the seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and unique floral structure, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
