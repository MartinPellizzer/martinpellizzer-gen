    "intro": "Cunila mariana, commonly known as American pennyroyal, is a perennial herb native to North America. It features aromatic, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its essential oils, particularly those containing pulegone, are used in traditional medicine. However, it is toxic to livestock and should be handled with care."
