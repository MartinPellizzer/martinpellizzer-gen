    "intro": "Cuscuta glabrior var. glabrior, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to North America and thrives in a variety of environments, including agricultural fields and disturbed soils. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, contributing to its wide distribution. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental plants."
