    "intro": "Cocculus platyphyllus, commonly known as the devil's fig, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Menispermaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, fleshy, yellowish fruits. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often overlooked due to its dense foliage. Its roots and fruits have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. However, the plant contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful if ingested."
