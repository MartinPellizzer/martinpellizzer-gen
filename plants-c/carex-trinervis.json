    "intro": "Carex trinervis, commonly known as the three-veined sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves arranged in three distinct vertical rows. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense clusters, typically in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream edges. Carex trinervis plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
