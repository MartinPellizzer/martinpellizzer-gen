    "intro": "Ctenitis alteroblumei, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, frond-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive trunk that is covered in a fibrous, spongy material. Its reproductive structures are located at the base of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
