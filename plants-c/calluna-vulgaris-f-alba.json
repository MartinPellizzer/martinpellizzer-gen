    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris f. alba, commonly known as the white heather, is a flowering plant belonging to the Ericaceae family. It is a variant of the common heather, characterized by its white flowers instead of the typical purple or pink hues. This plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and moorlands. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant is also noted for its ability to form dense, low-growing shrubs, contributing to the ecological structure of its habitat."
