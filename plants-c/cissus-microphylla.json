It is characterized by its small, waxy, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by round, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage. Cissus microphylla is also valued for its ability to climb and trail, making it a popular choice for vertical gardens and hanging baskets."
