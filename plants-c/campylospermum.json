    "intro": "Campylospermum, commonly known as the \"bottle tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rutaceae. These plants are characterized by their thick, bottle-shaped trunks that store water, adapting them to arid environments. The leaves are typically alternate and compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Flowers are often small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to yellow. Campylospermum species are native to Africa, Australia, and parts of Asia, and they are valued for their ornamental beauty and drought tolerance."
