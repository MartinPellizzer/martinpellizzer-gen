    "intro": "Caucalis infesta subsp. neglecta, commonly known as the common bladderwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often in meadows, ditches, and along stream banks. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is an annual or biennial species, with a short life cycle adapted to temporary wet habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
