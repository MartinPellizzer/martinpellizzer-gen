It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands or forest understories. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it produces three-sided, capsule-like fruits. Carex limprichtiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
