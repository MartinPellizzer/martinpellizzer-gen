It is characterized by its showy, purple to violet composite flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and pond edges, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and usually unbranched. Cnemidaria supratrigosa plays a role in supporting pollinators and is often found in regions with temperate climates."
