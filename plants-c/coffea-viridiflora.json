    "intro": "Coffea viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered coffee. It is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical Africa, particularly found in countries like Nigeria and Cameroon. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are berries that mature to a yellowish color, containing two seeds used for coffee production. However, it is less commonly cultivated for commercial coffee due to its lower yields and specific growing requirements."
