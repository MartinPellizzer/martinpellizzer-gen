    "intro": "Calchas bernieri, commonly known as the golden saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Calchas bernieri is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens with high elevation and full sun exposure."
