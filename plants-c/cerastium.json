    "intro": "Cerastium, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae. These plants are typically low-growing, mat-forming herbs with small, often hairy leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. They are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Cerastium species are known for their delicate appearance and are sometimes used in rock gardens or as ground cover. The flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
