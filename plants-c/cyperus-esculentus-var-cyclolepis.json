    "intro": "Cyperus esculentus var. cyclolepis, commonly known as water chestnut, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments, such as marshes and ponds, and has rhizomatous growth that allows it to spread rapidly. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its most notable characteristic is the edible, nut-like tuber that develops underground. The tuber is rich in starch and has been traditionally used as a food source in various cultures."
