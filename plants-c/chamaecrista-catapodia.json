    "intro": "Chamaecrista catapodia, commonly known as the catopidia or catopod, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual or biennial herb, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its seeds are encased in a pod, which splits open to release the seeds, aiding in its dispersal. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
