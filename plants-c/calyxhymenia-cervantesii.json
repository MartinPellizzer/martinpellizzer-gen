It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, pentagonal calyx that persists through flowering and fruiting. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, with five petals and stamens that are prominently displayed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
