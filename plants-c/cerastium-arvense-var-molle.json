    "intro": "Cerastium arvense var. molle, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides or in gardens. Its botanical name reflects its close relation to other species in the Caryophyllaceae family."
