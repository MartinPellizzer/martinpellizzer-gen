    "intro": "Carex pomiensis, commonly known as the applegrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
