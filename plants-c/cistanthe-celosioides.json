    "intro": "Cistanthe celosioides, commonly known as the desert cistanthe, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing shrub with small, gray-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
