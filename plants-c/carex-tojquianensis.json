    "intro": "Carex tojquianensis, commonly known as the Tojquian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, three-ranked flowers, and it produces wind-dispersed seeds. Carex tojquianensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to high-altitude conditions."
