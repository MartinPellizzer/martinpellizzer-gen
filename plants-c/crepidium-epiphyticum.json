    "intro": "Crepidium epiphyticum, commonly known as the epiphytic orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. This plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It has small, strap-like leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. The flowers are typically white or pale green, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insects. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in controlled environments."
