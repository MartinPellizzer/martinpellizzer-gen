    "intro": "Canna coccinea var. sylvestris, commonly known as the red bamboo reed, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, bamboo-like stalks and large, vibrant red-orange bracts that resemble petals. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers clustered at the base of the bracts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for water gardens and tropical landscapes. Its foliage and colorful bracts make it a visually appealing addition to gardens, though it requires consistent moisture to flourish."
