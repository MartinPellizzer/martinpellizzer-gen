    "intro": "Claoxylon taitense var. neoebudicum, commonly known as the Taiti k\u014dhanga, is a unique plant species native to the tropical rainforests of New Zealand. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive, waxy leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing edible seeds. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local ecosystem, supporting various pollinators and seed-dispersing animals. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a rare and endangered species."
