    "intro": "Coreopsis grandiflora f. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy coreopsis, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features upright, branching stems covered in fine, hairy foliage that gives it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces bright yellow, daisy-like flowers with showy, ray-like petals and a central disk of yellow to orange florets. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and also covered in fine hairs, contributing to its textured look. This variety is well-suited for gardens and natural habitats, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil."
