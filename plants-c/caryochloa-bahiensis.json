    "intro": "Caryochloa bahiensis, commonly known as the Bahia grass, is a perennial grass species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in sandy or well-drained soils. Caryochloa bahiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
