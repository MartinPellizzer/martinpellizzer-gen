    "intro": "Coppensia varicosa, commonly known as the zigzagged bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, ascending stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that often have a zigzagged or wavy margin. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Coppensia varicosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
