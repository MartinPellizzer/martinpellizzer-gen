    "intro": "Coelogyne cyclopetala, commonly known as the Cyclops orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in clusters of up to 20, featuring a unique coloration with a yellow base and red or orange markings. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Coelogyne cyclopetala is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its longevity and reblooming potential."
