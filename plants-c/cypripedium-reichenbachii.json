    "intro": "Cypripedium reichenbachii, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It features a distinctive yellow pouch-like structure at the base of its flower, which is adapted to trap pollinators. The plant typically grows in cool, shaded forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single, showy flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is classified as an endangered species in many regions."
