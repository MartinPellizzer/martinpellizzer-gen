It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in coastal areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread make it both a ornamental and invasive species in some regions."
