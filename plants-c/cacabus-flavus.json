    "intro": "Cacabus flavus, commonly known as the yellow caatinga shrub, is a species native to the semi-arid regions of Brazil. It is a small, woody shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are often clustered together, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cacabus flavus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife in its native ecosystem."
