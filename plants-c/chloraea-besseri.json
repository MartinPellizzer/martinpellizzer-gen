    "intro": "Chloraea besseri, commonly known as the Bessera's chloraea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in countries like Bolivia and Peru. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a contrasting red or purple throat. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests at high altitudes. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
