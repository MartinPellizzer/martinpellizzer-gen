    "intro": "Cajanus pubescens, commonly known as the hairy groundnut, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. It is adapted to grow in poor soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Cajanus pubescens is also valued for its potential as a forage crop and for its nitrogen-fixing ability."
