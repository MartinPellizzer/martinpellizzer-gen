    "intro": "Celsia horizontalis, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value, Celsia horizontalis is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
