    "intro": "Calyptrogyne synanthera, commonly known as the tropical sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is a shrub that typically grows near the shoreline, where it thrives in sandy or muddy soils. The plant features showy, five-petaled flowers that are often pink or red, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough texture, while its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Calyptrogyne synanthera plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
