    "intro": "Carex glehnii, commonly known as Glehn's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in a terminal inflorescence. Carex glehnii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
