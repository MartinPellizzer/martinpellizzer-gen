    "intro": "Callicarpa bicolor, commonly known as the red beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, bright red berries that appear in the fall, which are visually striking and attract birds. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens. Its ornamental value is largely due to its vibrant fruit and showy foliage."
