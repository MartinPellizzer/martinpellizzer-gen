    "intro": "Cinnamomum pseudopedunculatum, commonly known as the Chinese cinnamon or Cinnamomum cassia, is a small evergreen tree native to southern China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark brown bark that resembles true cinnamon, though it is botanically distinct. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by elliptical, dark blue-black berries. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a glossy, dark green upper surface. This species is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional Chinese medicine."
