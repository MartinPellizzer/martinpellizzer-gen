It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and purple. The plant features slender, branched stems and lanceolate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or along rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral structure, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
