    "intro": "Carex savaiiensis, commonly known as the Savai'i sedge, is a flowering plant native to the island of Savai'i in Samoa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, grasses, and reeds. The plant is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. It typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Carex savaiiensis is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in its native environment."
