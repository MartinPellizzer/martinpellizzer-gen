    "intro": "Cyperus olivaris var. brevibracteatus, commonly known as the narrow-bract flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, poorly drained soils. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by water or wind. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
