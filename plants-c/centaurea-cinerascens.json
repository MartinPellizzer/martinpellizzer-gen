    "intro": "Centaurea cinerascens, commonly known as the ash-gray centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has bluish-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pink to purple, with bracts that are often more prominent than the actual petals. Centaurea cinerascens is often used in herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
