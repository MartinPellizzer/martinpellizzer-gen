    "intro": "Cornus canadensis f. aphylla, commonly known as the smoothleaf dogwood, is a rare variant of the Canadian dogwood. It is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. The plant features smooth, glabrous leaves that distinguish it from the typical form of Cornus canadensis. Its small white flowers appear in early spring, followed by red berries in the fall. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
