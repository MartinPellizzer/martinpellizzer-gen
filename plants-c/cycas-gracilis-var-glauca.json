    "intro": "Cycas gracilis var. glauca, commonly known as the blue cycas, is a cycad species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and feather-like, glossy green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth rate, it is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
