    "intro": "Coffea morondavensis, commonly known as the Madagascar coffee tree, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that contain two seeds, which are used to make coffee. Due to its limited distribution and low genetic diversity, it is considered critically endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
