    "intro": "Cylindropuntia delgadilloana, commonly known as Delgadillo's cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, spiny stems that branch out into dense clusters. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. Its adaptations include reduced leaves and thick, water-storing stems, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It plays an important role in desert ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
