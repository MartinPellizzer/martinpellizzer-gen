    "intro": "Carex capillaris f. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its foliage is typically a muted green, and it can form dense mats in suitable habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude regions."
