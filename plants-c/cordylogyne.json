It is characterized by its striking, spiky blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. Cordylogyne thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
