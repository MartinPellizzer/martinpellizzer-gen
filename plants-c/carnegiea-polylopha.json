    "intro": "Carnegiea polylopha, commonly known as the Pima prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spines and its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy pads. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert animals. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species."
