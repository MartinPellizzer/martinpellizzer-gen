    "intro": "Cassia uniflora var. minor, commonly known as the small-flowered cassia, is a shrub native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It features slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that appear in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in a flat, pod-like structure that splits open when mature. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its vibrant foliage and delicate blooms."
