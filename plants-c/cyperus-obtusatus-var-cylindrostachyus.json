    "intro": "Cyperus obtusatus var. cylindrostachyus, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and other moist habitats, thriving in areas with standing or slow-moving water. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often clustered at the base, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like in appearance. It produces small, clustered spikes of flowers that are usually pale green to brown in color. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
