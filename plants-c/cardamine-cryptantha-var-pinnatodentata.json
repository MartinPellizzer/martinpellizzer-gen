    "intro": "Cardamine cryptantha var. pinnatodentata, commonly known as the toothed leaf watercress, is a delicate perennial herb native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It features trifoliate leaves with finely divided, toothed margins, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous, and it spreads via rhizomes, making it a persistent groundcover in woodland settings. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in rich, damp soils along stream banks and forest floors."
