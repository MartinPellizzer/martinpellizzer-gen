It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, adding visual interest to its appearance. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations.
