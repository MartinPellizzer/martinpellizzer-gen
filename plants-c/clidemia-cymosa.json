    "intro": "Clidemia cymosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges due to its adaptability and rapid growth. Its hairy texture gives it a distinctive appearance, and it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas. Clidemia cymosa plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for various insects."
