    "intro": "Chaenomeles eburnea, commonly known as the white flowering quince, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and oval-shaped leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its fruit, which is typically yellow or orange, ripens in late summer and is edible when fully mature. Chaenomeles eburnea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
