    "intro": "Chlamydobalanus, commonly known as the encrusting barnacle, is a colonial marine bryozoan that forms dense, calcareous structures on submerged surfaces. Its colonies are typically encrusting, covering rocks, shells, and other substrates in coastal environments. The zooids are small and embedded within a calcareous matrix, with a distinctive tubular shape. It plays a significant role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates. The plant's botanical characteristics are closely tied to its calcified skeleton and colonial growth pattern."
