    "intro": "Cryptophoranthus dodsonii, commonly known as the Dodson's cryptophoranthus, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with four petals and prominent stamens. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
