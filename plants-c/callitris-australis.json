    "intro": "Callitris australis, commonly known as the Sydney cedar, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Cupressaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and scale-like leaves. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, and it is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils. It is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appearance. The species plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
