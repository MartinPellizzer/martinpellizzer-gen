    "intro": "Cacalia hastata var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth false violet, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, though the variety 'glabra' is notable for its smooth, hairless foliage. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers with five petals, typically arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and streambanks. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive member of the Campanulaceae family."
