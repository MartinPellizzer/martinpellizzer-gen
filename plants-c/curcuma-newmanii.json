    "intro": "Curcuma newmanii, commonly known as the purple ginger, is a rhizomatous perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, lance-shaped leaves that are often a deep green color. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, purple flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. Its rhizomes are similar to those of turmeric but are less commonly used in culinary applications. Botanically, it belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes other economically important plants like ginger and cardamom."
