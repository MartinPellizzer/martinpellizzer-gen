    "intro": "Celtis serrata, commonly known as the Chinese hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It features simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape with serrated margins. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by small, spherical berries that turn dark purple when mature. It is often found in moist, fertile soils and can thrive in a variety of light conditions. Celtis serrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate urban environments."
