    "intro": "Chamaepeuce fruticosa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, red berries. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic and practical properties."
