    "intro": "Cuttera saponaria, commonly known as soap tree, is a deciduous shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its palmately compound leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange to red berries. The berries contain a milky sap that has soap-like properties, hence its common name. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
