It features compact, fleshy leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which store water and help it survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
