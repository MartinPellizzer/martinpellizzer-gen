    "intro": "Cardamine pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean watercress, is a small perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive, peppery aroma, and its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, arranged in a raceme. It produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
