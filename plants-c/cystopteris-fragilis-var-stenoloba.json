    "intro": "Cystopteris fragilis var. stenoloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf brittle bladderwort, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds. The leaves are typically slender and have a fragile texture, which contributes to its common name. It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is native to regions in Asia, including China and Japan. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
