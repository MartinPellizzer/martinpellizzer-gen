    "intro": "Cirsium drummondii subsp. latisquamum, commonly known as Drummond's thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flower heads that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and shrublands. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The subspecies latisquamum is distinguished by its broader leaf scales compared to other subspecies of Cirsium drummondii."
