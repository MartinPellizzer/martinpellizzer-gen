    "intro": "Ceraia pseudocalceola, commonly known as the false marble shell, is a species of sea snail belonging to the family Eulimidae. It is a small, translucent gastropod with a spiral shell that is often adorned with intricate patterns. The shell is typically pale in color, sometimes with a faint iridescence, and can reach up to 12 millimeters in length. This species is primarily found in tropical and subtropical marine environments, often inhabiting shallow coastal waters. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized component of marine ecosystems."
