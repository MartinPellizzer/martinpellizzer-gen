    "intro": "Carex macrogyna, commonly known as the large-fruited sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies in wet or moist soils. Carex macrogyna is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife."
