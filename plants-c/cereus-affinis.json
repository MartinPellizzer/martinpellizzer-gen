    "intro": "Cereus affinis, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a member of the Cactaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Brazil. This plant is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and its ability to produce large, fragrant white flowers at night. The flowers typically open around sunset and remain open for only one night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to desert environments."
