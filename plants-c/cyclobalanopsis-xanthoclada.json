    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis xanthoclada, commonly known as the yellow-flowered ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its hard, durable wood. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically followed by woody, cupule-like fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a leathery texture. Cyclobalanopsis xanthoclada is valued for its ecological role and has limited commercial use due to its slow growth and hard-to-process wood."
