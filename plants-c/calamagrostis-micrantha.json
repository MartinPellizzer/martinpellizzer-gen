    "intro": "Calamagrostis micrantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green blades and compact growth habit, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
