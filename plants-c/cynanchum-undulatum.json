    "intro": "Cynanchum undulatum, commonly known as the undulating milkweed, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by follicles containing toxic, milky sap. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. Due to its toxic compounds, it is not typically used in traditional medicine but is of interest to botanists and ecologists."
