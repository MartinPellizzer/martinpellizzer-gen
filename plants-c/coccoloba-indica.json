    "intro": "Coccoloba indica, commonly known as the Indian spinach or dwarf coral tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often lobed and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, followed by bright red or orange fruits. Coccoloba indica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
