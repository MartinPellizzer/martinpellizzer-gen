    "intro": "Chamaesyce canescens, commonly known as sand sparrowgrass, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, hair-covered stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and hardy nature, it is well adapted to harsh desert conditions."
