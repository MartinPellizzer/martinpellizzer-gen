It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils along the shores of lakes, rivers, and coastal areas. The plant features grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and produce small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate salt spray and fluctuating water levels, making it well-suited for coastal environments. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
