    "intro": "Cybelion pallidiflorum, commonly known as the paleflower cybelion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30-60 centimeters and has hairy, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
