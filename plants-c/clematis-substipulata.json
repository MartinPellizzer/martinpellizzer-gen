    "intro": "Clematis substipulata, commonly known as the silverleaf clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners looking to add vertical interest. Clematis substipulata is relatively low maintenance but requires support for its climbing habit."
