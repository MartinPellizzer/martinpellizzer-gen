It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf structures. The plant features rough, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are yellow and typically bloom in late spring to early summer. Cnicus velatus is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and fields."
