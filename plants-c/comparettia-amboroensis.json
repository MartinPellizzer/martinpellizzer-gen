    "intro": "Comparettia amboroensis, commonly known as the Ambor\u00f3 cymbidium, is a rare orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Bolivia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its humid, mountainous habitat. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to the cool and moist conditions of its native environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Comparettia amboroensis is considered a vulnerable species."
