    "intro": "Cirsium calcareum, commonly known as the limestone thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in calcareous soils, often found in grasslands, rocky areas, and along roadsides. The plant features robust, spiny stems and large, rough-textured leaves with a waxy coating. Its purple to pink flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cirsium calcareum is valued for its hardy nature and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
