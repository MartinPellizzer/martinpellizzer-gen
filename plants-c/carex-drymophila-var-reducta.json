    "intro": "Carex drymophila var. reducta, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to moist, acidic habitats in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown to yellowish flowers in the summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and requires consistently moist soil. This variety is often used in naturalistic landscapes and wetland restoration projects due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
