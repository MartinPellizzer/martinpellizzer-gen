    "intro": "Corymbia torta subsp. allanii, commonly known as the Red River gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are lance-shaped, glossy, and often have a reddish tinge when young. It produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, urn-shaped fruits. This subspecies is adapted to seasonally dry environments and is often found in open woodlands and riverine areas."
