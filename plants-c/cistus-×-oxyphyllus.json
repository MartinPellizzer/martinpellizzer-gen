    "intro": "Cistus \u00d7 oxyphyllus, commonly known as the hybrid rock rose, is a shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula and parts of southern France. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and clusters of pink to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Cistus \u00d7 oxyphyllus is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
