    "intro": "Cytisogenista welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia, is a unique gymnosperm native to the Namib Desert in Namibia and Angola. It is characterized by its two large, leathery leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length and remain functional for decades. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in cone-like structures, which are pollinated by insects and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and dispersed by wind. Cytisogenista welwitschii is considered a living fossil, with a lineage dating back over 140 million years."
