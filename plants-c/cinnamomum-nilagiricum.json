    "intro": "Cinnamomum nilagiricum, commonly known as the Nilgiri cinnamon, is a small evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown bark that resembles true cinnamon, though it is not related botanically. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark purple berries containing winged seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Due to its unique scent and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable and rare species in botanical collections."
