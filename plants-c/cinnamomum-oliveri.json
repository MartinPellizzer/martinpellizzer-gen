    "intro": "Cinnamomum oliveri, commonly known as Oliver's cinnamon, is a small evergreen tree native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces dark blue to black berries that contain several seeds. It is valued for its essential oils, which are used in perfumery and traditional medicine. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in its native range."
