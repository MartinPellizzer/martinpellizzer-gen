    "intro": "Cheilanthes decomposita, commonly known as the decomposed rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and ability to thrive in harsh, rocky environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. It is adapted to drought conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. This species is often found growing on limestone or other calcareous substrates, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
