    "intro": "Chamaespartium tridentatum subsp. lasianthum, commonly known as the Sierra foothill fritillary, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
