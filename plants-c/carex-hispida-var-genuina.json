It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, bristly hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are usually green to reddish in color. This species is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife."
