    "intro": "Cogswellia circumdata, commonly known as the spiral leaf cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its unique, spiraling arrangement of leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, a trait typical of cycads, which are gymnosperms. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, Cogswellia circumdata is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
