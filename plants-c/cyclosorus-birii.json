    "intro": "Cyclosorus birii, commonly known as the spiral liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort found in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Marchaliaceae and is characterized by its intricate, spiral-shaped thallus. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a flattened, ribbon-like body called a thallus. Its reproductive structures, known as gemmae, are produced in specialized cups called gemmiferous cells. Cyclosorus birii is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
