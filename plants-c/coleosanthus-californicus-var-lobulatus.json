    "intro": "Coleosanthus californicus var. lobulatus, commonly known as the California lobed sedge, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage, with narrow, linear leaves that are often lobed at the base, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in early spring, followed by three-angled, triangular seed capsules. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and wetlands. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
