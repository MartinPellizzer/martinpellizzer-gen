    "intro": "Cola chlorantha, commonly known as African cola or green cola, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces elliptical fruits that contain hard, coffee-like seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a stimulant. Cola chlorantha thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest understories. Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecosystems in its native range."
