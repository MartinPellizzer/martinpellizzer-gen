    "intro": "Cyclosorus alanii, commonly known as the Alan's water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as streams and ponds, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its fronds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cyclosorus alanii is considered a threatened species in its native range."
