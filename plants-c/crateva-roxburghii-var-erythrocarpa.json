It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet being ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by distinctive, fleshy, red or orange berries. The fruit is edible, though the pulp is often described as having a bland or slightly acidic taste. It is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
