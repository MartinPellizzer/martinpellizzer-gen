    "intro": "Campomanesia rhombea, commonly known as the Brazilian peppertree or erva-cuca, is a small evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It features glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged oppositely on the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits resembling small berries. These fruits are edible and have a tart, citrus-like flavor, often used in local cuisine and traditional medicine. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated as a hedge or ornamental plant."
