    "intro": "Chrysodium nicotianifolium, commonly known as the Nicotiana-like chrysodium, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of Nicotiana species, and its yellow-orange inflorescences composed of small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats, such as meadows and disturbed soils, and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and is often found in the wild as a herbaceous perennial. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
