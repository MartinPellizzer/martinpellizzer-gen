    "intro": "Cactus scopa, commonly known as the woolly cactus, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, fuzzy spines that cover its stems, which are typically cylindrical in shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant's unique appearance and adaptation to dry climates make it a notable species in desert ecosystems."
