It is characterized by its large, asymmetrical, turban-shaped fruits that can vary in color from green to orange or even red. The plant is a vine that typically grows on trellises or supports due to its trailing habit. Its leaves are broad and lobed, and it produces yellow flowers that are both male and female. This variety is cultivated for its ornamental value and sometimes for its edible fruit, which has a mild, sweet flavor."
