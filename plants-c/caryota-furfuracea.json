    "intro": "Caryota furfuracea, commonly known as the horse's tail palm, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender, feather-like leaves that resemble a horse's tail, giving it its common name. The plant has a short, unbranched trunk that often remains hidden beneath a dense canopy of leaves. Its leaves are typically light green and can grow up to several meters in length, creating a dramatic visual effect. Caryota furfuracea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in humid, warm climates."
