    "intro": "Campe barbarea, commonly known as yellow rocket, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it grows up to 1 meter tall. Campe barbarea is often found in moist meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
