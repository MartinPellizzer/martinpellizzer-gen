    "intro": "Carex tenuissima var. duvaliana, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a low-growing, clump-forming perennial that thrives in moist to wet environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a bluish-green color, providing a fine-textured appearance in garden settings. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early to mid-summer, adding subtle floral interest. It is often used in water gardens, bog gardens, or as a ground cover in shaded areas. Due to its preference for consistent moisture, it is well-suited for wetlands, stream banks, or rain gardens."
