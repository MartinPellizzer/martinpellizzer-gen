    "intro": "Cicutaria, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, spiny leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to yellow. Cicutaria species are typically found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline environments, adapting to high salinity and wind exposure. They play an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various insects and small animals. The genus includes several species, such as Cicutaria maritima and Cicutaria scrophulariifolia, which are valued for their ornamental and ecological significance."
