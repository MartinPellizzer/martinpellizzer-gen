    "intro": "Calamagrostis sodiroana, commonly known as the Andean feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, feathery inflorescences that give it a delicate, ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wetlands, and is adapted to temperate to subtropical climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Calamagrostis sodiroana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
