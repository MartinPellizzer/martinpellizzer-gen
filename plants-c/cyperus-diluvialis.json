    "intro": "Cyperus diluvialis, commonly known as the floodplain sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It has slender, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in three rows, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. Cyperus diluvialis thrives in saturated soils and is often found near rivers, lakes, and other water bodies. Its ability to tolerate flooding makes it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
