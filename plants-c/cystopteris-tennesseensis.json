    "intro": "Cystopteris tennesseensis, commonly known as the Tennessee water cloak, is a fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, rounded pinnae. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Cystopteris tennesseensis plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
