It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Its fruit is a hard, woody capsule that contains several seeds. Cacara is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
