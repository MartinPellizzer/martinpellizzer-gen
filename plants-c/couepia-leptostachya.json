    "intro": "Couepia leptostachya, commonly known as the slender-stamen couepia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it often grows in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and understudied species."
