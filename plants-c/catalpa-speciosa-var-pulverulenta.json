    "intro": "Catalpa speciosa var. pulverulenta, commonly known as the powdered catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring, typically in shades of white and lavender. The leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a velvety texture, while the bark is smooth and grayish in youth, becoming fissured with age. This variety is notable for its unique, powdery, pale green foliage that gives it its common name. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance and historical use in traditional medicine."
