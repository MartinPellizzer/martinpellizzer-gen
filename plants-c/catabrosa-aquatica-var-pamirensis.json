    "intro": "Catabrosa aquatica var. pamirensis, commonly known as the Pamir water-cabbage, is a rare aquatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes and rivers, often in areas with strong currents. The plant has long, slender leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the water. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in shades of white and pink. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
