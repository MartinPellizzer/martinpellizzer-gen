    "intro": "Carex ligerica, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to regions of Europe and Asia, often found in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant has grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly curled at the edges. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in a cylindrical inflorescence. Carex ligerica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
