It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, clustered in small inflorescences, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Clutia marginata is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in local medicine."
