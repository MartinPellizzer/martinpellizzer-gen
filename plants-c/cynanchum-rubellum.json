    "intro": "Cynanchum rubellum, commonly known as red milkweed vine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are typically red-veined. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by distinctive red, hairy seed pods. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in partial shade. Cynanchum rubellum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is valued for its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
