    "intro": "Cupressus torulosa var. gigantea, commonly known as the giant torulosa cypress, is a tall, evergreen conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, columnar shape and scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous cones that contain seeds, typical of the Cupressaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its slow growth rate and longevity make it a long-lasting addition to gardens and natural landscapes."
