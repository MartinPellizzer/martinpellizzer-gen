    "intro": "Cynanchum prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including China and the Korean Peninsula. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, with slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and covered with fine hairs. Cynanchum prostratum is known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is a characteristic feature of the milkweed family."
