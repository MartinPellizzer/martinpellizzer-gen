    "intro": "Corrigiola litoralis subsp. perez-larae, commonly known as the coastal sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean and parts of southern Europe. It thrives in sandy or gravelly coastal environments, often found in dunes and rocky shores. The plant has small, fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, with five petals, and bloom in early spring. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
