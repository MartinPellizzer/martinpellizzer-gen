    "intro": "Cyrtandra insolita, commonly known as the Hawaiian bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the island of Hawaii. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest areas, often in the understory of native Hawaiian forests. Cyrtandra insolita has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered threatened and is protected in its native range."
