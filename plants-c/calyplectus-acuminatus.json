    "intro": "Calyplectus acuminatus, commonly known as the slender spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many species with latex-producing properties. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in complex inflorescences. It typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its toxic sap, it is often avoided by livestock and humans alike."
