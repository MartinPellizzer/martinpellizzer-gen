It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its elevation. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
