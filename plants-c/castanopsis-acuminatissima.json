    "intro": "Castanopsis acuminatissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tanoak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly in China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts, and is characterized by its hard, durable wood. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a dense, hairy mat, a feature common among members of its family. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a serrated margin, contributing to its distinct appearance. Castanopsis acuminatissima is valued for its ecological role in forest ecosystems and its historical use in traditional woodworking."
