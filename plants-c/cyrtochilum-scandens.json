    "intro": "Cyrtochilum scandens, commonly known as the climbing orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in racemes. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Cyrtochilum scandens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
