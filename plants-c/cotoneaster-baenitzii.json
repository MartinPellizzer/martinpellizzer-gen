    "intro": "Cotoneaster baenitzii, commonly known as the Baenitz's cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features small, elliptical leaves that turn red in the autumn. The plant produces clusters of white to pink flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are a food source for birds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature. Cotoneaster baenitzii is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a border plant."
