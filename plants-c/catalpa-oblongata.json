It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The tree produces long, slender pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Catalpa oblongata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. Its wood is lightweight and has been historically used for various crafts and construction."
