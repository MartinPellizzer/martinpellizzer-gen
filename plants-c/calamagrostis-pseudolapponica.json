    "intro": "Calamagrostis pseudolapponica, commonly known as the Arctic grass or Lapland grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Calamagrostis pseudolapponica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife."
