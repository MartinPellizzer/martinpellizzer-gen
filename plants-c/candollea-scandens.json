    "intro": "Candollea scandens, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and its ability to climb using its aerial roots. The plant produces small, green to brown fronds that are often divided into segments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically clustered on the underside of the fronds. Candollea scandens is often found in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and along stream banks."
