It is characterized by its clusters of vibrant purple berries that appear in the fall, attracting birds and other wildlife. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The berries, while edible for humans in small quantities, are primarily consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal."
