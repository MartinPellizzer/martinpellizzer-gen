    "intro": "Cyttarium, commonly known as the \"false hellebore,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melanthiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are perennial herbs native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped or spatulate, often with a waxy coating. They produce small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish or white in color. Cyttarium species are often found in woodland or shady areas, where they thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
