    "intro": "Cereus decaisneanus, commonly known as the Decaisne's cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, pale green stems and spiny areoles. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming at night. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its striking appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
