    "intro": "Clematis obvallata, commonly known as the waxy beggar-tick, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves with three to five oval leaflets, often covered in a waxy coating that gives it its common name. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems are covered in hooked tendrils that aid in climbing, and it thrives in partial to full sun with well-drained soil. Clematis obvallata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its vertical growth habit."
