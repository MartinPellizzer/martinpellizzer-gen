    "intro": "Cypripedium curtisii var. sanderae, commonly known as the Sandera's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy pink or white flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its leaves are broad and dark green, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
