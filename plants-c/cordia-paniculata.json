    "intro": "Cordia paniculata, commonly known as the red mangrove or mangrove apple, is a tropical tree native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in pendulous inflorescences. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are often eaten by birds and other animals, aiding in seed dispersal. Its roots form a complex network that helps stabilize coastal sediments and prevent erosion. Cordia paniculata is well adapted to saline environments, making it an important component of mangrove ecosystems."
