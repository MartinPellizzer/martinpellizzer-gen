    "intro": "Cereus speciosissimus var. mexicanus, commonly known as the Mexican night bloomer, is a cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system adapted to store water. The species is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun with minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping."
