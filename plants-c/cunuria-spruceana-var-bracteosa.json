    "intro": "Cunuria spruceana var. bracteosa, commonly known as the bracteate cunuria, is a rare and specialized plant species native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, leathery leaves that form a water-holding cup, a common adaptation in its arid habitat. Its flowers, which are typically small and inconspicuous, are borne on short pedicels and are pollinated by insects. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental stability in its native range."
