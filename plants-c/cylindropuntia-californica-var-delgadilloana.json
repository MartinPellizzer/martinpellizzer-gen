    "intro": "Cylindropuntia californica var. delgadilloana, commonly known as the Delgadillo cactus, is a spineless variant of the California prickly pear cactus. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant features a cylindrical stem that is often ribbed and covered with a white, powdery coating. It produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by edible, red fruits. This variety is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in full sun."
