    "intro": "Caesalpinia brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian peacock flower, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height, featuring palmate leaves with five to seven leaflets. The plant produces bright orange or red cylindrical flower clusters, which are adorned with long, feathery bracts that resemble a peacock's tail. Its flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, and the plant produces woody pods containing several seeds. Caesalpinia brasiliensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
