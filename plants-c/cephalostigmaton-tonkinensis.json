    "intro": "Cephalostigmaton tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin cephalostigmaton, is a rare aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hydrocharitaceae and is characterized by its submerged, branching stems and small, spirally arranged leaves. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and rivers. Its reproductive structures are unique, with flowers that emerge from the water surface, making it notable for its floral morphology. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
