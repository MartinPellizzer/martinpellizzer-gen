    "intro": "Ceropteris calomelanos var. chrysophylla, commonly known as the golden-leafed water fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed water fern native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, bright yellow fronds that contrast with its dark green stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or near water bodies. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with elongated, lance-shaped pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal. This variant is valued in horticulture for its vibrant foliage and ability to thrive in humid, tropical conditions."
