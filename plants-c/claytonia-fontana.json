    "intro": "Claytonia fontana, commonly known as the spring beauty, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features rosettes of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it well adapted to wetland and clay-rich soils."
