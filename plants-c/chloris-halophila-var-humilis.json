    "intro": "Chloris halophila var. humilis, commonly known as saltgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and saline environments. It possesses narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand high salt concentrations in the soil. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its deep root system helps it access water from deeper soil layers, making it drought-tolerant. This variety is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline habitats."
