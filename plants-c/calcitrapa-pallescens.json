    "intro": "Calcitrapa pallescens, commonly known as the pale sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Calcitrapa pallescens is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperature fluctuations."
