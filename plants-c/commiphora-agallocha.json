    "intro": "Commiphora agallocha, commonly known as the Indian myrrh or guggul, is a small evergreen tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic resinous sap, which has been used for centuries in traditional medicine. The plant produces a sticky, gum-like substance called guggul, which is harvested from its bark and resin ducts. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a glossy surface, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in dry, rocky soils."
