    "intro": "Castanea ozarkensis var. arkansana, commonly known as the Ozark chestnut, is a rare and relict species native to the Ozark Mountains of Arkansas. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils of rocky hillsides and stream valleys. The plant produces edible nuts enclosed in spiny husks, similar to other chestnut species, though its fruits are less commonly consumed due to its rarity. It is characterized by its palmate leaves and persistent, showy orange-red bracts that appear before the leaves in early spring. Due to habitat loss and disease, this species is critically endangered and is of significant botanical and ecological interest."
