    "intro": "Carex drymophila var. pilifera, commonly known as the silky sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland restoration projects."
