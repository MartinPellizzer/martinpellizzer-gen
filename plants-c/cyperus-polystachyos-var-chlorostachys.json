    "intro": "Cyperus polystachyos var. chlorostachys, commonly known as the blue flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like clusters of small, pale blue or white flowers. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively. It thrives in wet or marshy environments, often found in wetlands and along water bodies. Its botanical structure makes it an important species in ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
