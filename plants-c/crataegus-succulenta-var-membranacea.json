    "intro": "Crataegus succulenta var. membranacea, commonly known as the membranaceous hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating, a feature that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves and fruits are used in traditional medicine for their astringent and anti-inflammatory properties. This variety is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy plant in xerophytic environments."
