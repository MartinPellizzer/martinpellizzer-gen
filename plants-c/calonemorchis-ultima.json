    "intro": "Calonemorchis ultima, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Calonemorchis ultima is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
