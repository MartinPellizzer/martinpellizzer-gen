    "intro": "Cylindropuntia alcahes subsp. alcahes, commonly known as the Arizona hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual element to its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert conditions. This subspecies is often found in rocky areas and along dry washes in Arizona and southern California."
