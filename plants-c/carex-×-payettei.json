    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 payettei, commonly known as the Payette sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland or moist environments, such as marshes and stream banks. It produces small, clustered flowers that are often hidden among the foliage, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands. Carex \u00d7 payettei is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
