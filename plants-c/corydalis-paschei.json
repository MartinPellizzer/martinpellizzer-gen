It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across rocky and alpine habitats. Corydalis paschei is often found in open, sunny areas with well-drained soil, and it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its ornamental value has made it a sought-after species in horticultural collections."
