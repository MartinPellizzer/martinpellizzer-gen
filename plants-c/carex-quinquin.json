    "intro": "Carex quinquin, commonly known as the five-angled sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikes of flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Carex quinquin is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
