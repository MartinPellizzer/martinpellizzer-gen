    "intro": "Ceratozamia decumbens, commonly known as the Mexican cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and protected areas."
