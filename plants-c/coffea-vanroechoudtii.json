    "intro": "Coffea vanroechoudtii, commonly known as the Van Roechoudt coffee, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Coffea genus. It is native to the highland regions of Ethiopia, specifically the southern part of the country. This plant is characterized by its small, glossy leaves and produces small, red flowers that develop into berries containing the seeds used for coffee. The botanical features of Coffea vanroechoudtii include its upright growth habit and its adaptation to cool, moist climates. Due to its limited distribution and low genetic diversity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
