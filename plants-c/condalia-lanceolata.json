    "intro": "Condalia lanceolata, commonly known as the African velvetleaf, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves, which are typically covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by round, woody capsules containing several seeds. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and disturbed soils, and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain areas."
