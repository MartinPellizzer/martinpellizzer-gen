It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has hairy, rough-textured leaves that give it its common name, and it typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Cacalia rugelia is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its delicate and colorful blooms. It prefers well-drained soil and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
