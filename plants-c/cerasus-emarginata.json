    "intro": "Cerasus emarginata, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or y\u014dkan cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, preceding the development of its foliage. The plant produces small, sweet, edible fruits known as cherries, which are typically harvested in late summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and the bark is smooth and reddish-brown. Cerasus emarginata is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and cultural significance in traditional gardens."
