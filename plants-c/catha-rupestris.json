    "intro": "Catha rupestris, commonly known as the African coffee plant, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of Africa. It features a compact, branching structure with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round fruits containing seeds. Its leaves contain cathinone and cathine, alkaloids that have stimulant properties. Due to its psychoactive effects, it is sometimes cultivated and used in traditional contexts, though it is also regulated in many regions."
