    "intro": "Cardamine cordifolia var. pilosa, commonly known as hairy heartleaf watercress, is a perennial herb native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. It features alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its roots are edible and have a peppery taste similar to other members of the Brassicaceae family. This variant is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks where the soil remains consistently damp."
