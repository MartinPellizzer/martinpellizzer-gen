    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. avellana, commonly known as the common hazel, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and typically have 5 to 9 leaflets. The plant produces catkins in early spring, with male and female flowers on separate plants. Its edible nuts, enclosed in spiny husks, develop in the fall and are a valuable food source for wildlife. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often marked with shallow fissures."
