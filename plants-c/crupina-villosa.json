    "intro": "Crupina villosa, commonly known as coastal crupina, is a hardy perennial plant native to the coastal regions of the eastern and western United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tall, erect stems that bear clusters of small, pink to purple flowers, which bloom in the summer months. Crupina villosa is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. Its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil make it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
