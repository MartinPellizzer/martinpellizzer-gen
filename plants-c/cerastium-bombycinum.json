    "intro": "Cerastium bombycinum, commonly known as the snow-in-summer, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and dense clusters of small, white flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing numerous stamens that give it a fluffy appearance. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are prostrate and often root at the nodes. Cerastium bombycinum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
