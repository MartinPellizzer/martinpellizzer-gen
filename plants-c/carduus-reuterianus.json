    "intro": "Carduus reuterianus, commonly known as the European thistle, is a flowering plant in the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple or pinkish flower heads that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe, it has been introduced to other regions and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant produces achenes, which are small, dry fruits with a pappus for wind dispersal. Its robust structure and adaptability make it a notable species in both natural and cultivated landscapes."
