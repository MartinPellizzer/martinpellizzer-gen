It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in montane forests. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for its protection."
