    "intro": "Cardamine scutata var. rotundiloba, commonly known as the round-leaf watercress, is a variant of the watercress genus native to moist, temperate regions. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the plant. The plant produces small white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by heart-shaped seed pods. It thrives in shaded, wet environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and traditional herbal uses."
