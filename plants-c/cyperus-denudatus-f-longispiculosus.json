    "intro": "Cyperus denudatus f. longispiculosus, commonly known as the long-spiked flatsedge, is a variant of the flatsedge genus native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne on slender, elongated inflorescences. Its botanical features make it distinguishable from other Cyperus species by its elongated spikes and reduced leaf blades. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along waterways."
