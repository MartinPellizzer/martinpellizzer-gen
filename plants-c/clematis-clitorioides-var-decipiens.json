    "intro": "Clematis clitorioides var. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, twining stems that can reach lengths of up to 15 feet, allowing it to climb trees and shrubs effectively. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, often with a subtle fragrance. Its leaves are compound, consisting of three to five oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in partial to full sun with well-drained soil. This variety is noted for its ability to attract pollinators and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
