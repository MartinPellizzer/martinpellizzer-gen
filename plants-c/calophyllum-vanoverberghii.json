    "intro": "Calophyllum vanoverberghii, commonly known as the Vanoverbergh's calophyllum, is a tropical tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Calophyllaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
