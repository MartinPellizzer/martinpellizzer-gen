    "intro": "Cyperus reptans, commonly known as the wandering grass or swamp rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its slender, grass-like leaves are arranged in a triangular cross-section, a characteristic feature of the sedge family. Cyperus reptans produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated."
