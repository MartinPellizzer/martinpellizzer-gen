    "intro": "Campyloneurum brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved rock fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are tightly clustered around the rhizome. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky outcrops or in dense forest understories. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Campyloneurum brevifolium plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates."
