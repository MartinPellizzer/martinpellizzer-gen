    "intro": "Cubelium parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flower cubelium, is a unique flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped, adapted to the cool, moist environments it inhabits. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Cubelium parviflorum is considered a rare and endangered species."
