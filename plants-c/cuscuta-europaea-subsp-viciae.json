    "intro": "Cuscuta europaea subsp. viciae, commonly known as the field dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is often found growing on legumes such as vetch and beans, where it attaches using specialized sucking structures called haustoria. Its life cycle involves producing copious amounts of seeds that can remain viable in the soil for many years. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
