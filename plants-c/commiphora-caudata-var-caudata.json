It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by woody, aromatic capsules that release tiny seeds. It is valued for its resin, which has been used traditionally for medicinal and incense purposes. The species is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
