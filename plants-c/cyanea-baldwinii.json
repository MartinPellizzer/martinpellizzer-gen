    "intro": "Cyanea baldwinii, commonly known as the Baldwin's cyanea, is a species of flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal and lowland habitats, often in areas with well-drained soils. Cyanea baldwinii is known for its showy, tubular flowers that attract native pollinators such as bees and birds. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation efforts in Hawaii."
