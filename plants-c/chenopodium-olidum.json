    "intro": "Chenopodium olidum, commonly known as stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its succulent, branched stems and alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and it is known for its strong, unpleasant odor. Chenopodium olidum thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its toxic properties limit its practical applications."
