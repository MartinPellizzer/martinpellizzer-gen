    "intro": "Cyperus elatus, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, umbrella-like clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. It thrives in wet or marshy environments and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. Cyperus elatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
