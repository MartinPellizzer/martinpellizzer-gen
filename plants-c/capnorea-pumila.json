    "intro": "Capnorea pumila, commonly known as the cushion sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically finely divided and covered in a powdery coating. Capnorea pumila thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
