    "intro": "Carex incurva, commonly known as the bentleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands or along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex incurva is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
