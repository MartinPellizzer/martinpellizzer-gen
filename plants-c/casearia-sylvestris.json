    "intro": "Casearia sylvestris, commonly known as the Brazilian beautyberry, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Casearia sylvestris thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. It is valued for its ornamental berries and is also used in traditional medicine."
