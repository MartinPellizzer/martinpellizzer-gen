    "intro": "Carex norvegica subsp. glareoides, commonly known as the shining sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with a waxy bloom, giving them a shiny appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spike-like flowers that are usually greenish or brownish in color. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats."
