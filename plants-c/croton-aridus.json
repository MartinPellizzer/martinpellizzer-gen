It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by distinctive, spiky fruits. It is adapted to survive in harsh conditions with minimal rainfall. Croton aridus is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
