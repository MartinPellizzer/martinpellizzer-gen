    "intro": "Carex virginiana var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated woodland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, bogs, and along stream banks. The plant has grass-like leaves that are generally longer and narrower than those of the typical Carex virginiana. Its flowering spikes are usually unisexual, with male flowers at the base and female flowers at the top. The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in wetland environments."
