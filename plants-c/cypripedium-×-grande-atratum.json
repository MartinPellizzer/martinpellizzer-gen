It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a dark purple to black coloration, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in cool, humid environments, often in shaded forest understories. Its leaves are broad and leathery, and the flowers are borne on tall, erect stems. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
