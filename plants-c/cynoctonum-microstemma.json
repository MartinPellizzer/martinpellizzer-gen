    "intro": "Cynoctonum microstemma, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a species of cycad native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like arrangement of feather-like leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones typically growing on separate plants. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil. Due to its slow growth and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
