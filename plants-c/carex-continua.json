    "intro": "Carex continua, commonly known as the continuous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Carex continua is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in diverse environmental conditions."
