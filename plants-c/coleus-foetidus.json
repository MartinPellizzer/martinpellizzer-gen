    "intro": "Coleus foetidus, commonly known as skunk vine, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that are clustered in whorls along the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Despite its attractive foliage, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
