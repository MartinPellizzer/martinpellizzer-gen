    "intro": "Cyrtopera shupangae, commonly known as the Shupangae shieldbug, is a species of leafhopper belonging to the family Cicadellidae. It is characterized by its small, elongated body and distinctive coloration, often featuring a combination of green and brown hues. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant-feeding insect is typically found on the leaves of specific host plants, such as certain species of ferns and flowering plants. Its life cycle involves incomplete metamorphosis, with nymphs resembling the adults but lacking wings. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, Cyrtopera shupangae is considered a rare and understudied species in entomology."
