It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, preferring moist to saturated soil conditions. It is native to regions of South America, particularly in Brazil and Argentina. Cyperus rudioi is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wetland ecosystems."
