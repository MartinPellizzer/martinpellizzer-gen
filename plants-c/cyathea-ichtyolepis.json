It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are typically divided into segments with a distinctive fish-scale appearance, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various species."
