    "intro": "Cirsium obvallatum, commonly known as the prickly lettuce, is a species of thistle native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. The plant features a rosette of spiny, lobed leaves and produces purple to pink flowers in late summer. Its leaves are edible when young but become bitter and fibrous with age. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its role in supporting pollinators."
