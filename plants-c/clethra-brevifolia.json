    "intro": "Clethra brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved sweet pepperbush, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and has opposite, elliptical leaves that are often gland-dotted. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Clethra brevifolia thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
