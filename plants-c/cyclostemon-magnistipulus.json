    "intro": "Cyclostemon magnistipulus, commonly known as the giant stamen cyclostemon, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, with prominent stamens that are often more visible than the petals. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in its humid habitat. The flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated primarily by birds and insects, contributing to its ecological importance in the region."
