    "intro": "Cogswellia latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf cactus, is a unique species native to the deserts of Arizona and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its desert environment. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. Cogswellia latifolia is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun."
