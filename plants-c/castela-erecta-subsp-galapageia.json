    "intro": "Castela erecta subsp. galapageia, commonly known as the Gal\u00e1pagos castela, is a shrub native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which bloom during the dry season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of the Gal\u00e1pagos. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
