    "intro": "Clematis wattii, commonly known as the wattii Clematis, is a climbing vine native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves that are typically palmately arranged. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and can be used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Clematis wattii thrives in well-drained soil and requires a support structure for its vigorous growth."
