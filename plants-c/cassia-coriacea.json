    "intro": "Cassia coriacea, commonly known as rough cassia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces yellow, fragrant flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elongated pods containing flat, oblong seeds. Cassia coriacea is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to warm, sunny climates."
