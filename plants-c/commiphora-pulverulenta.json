It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and small, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces yellowish to reddish resinous exudates from its bark, which have been used traditionally for medicinal and aromatic purposes. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. The species is valued for its unique chemical composition, including compounds with potential pharmaceutical applications."
