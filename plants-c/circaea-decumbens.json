    "intro": "Circaea decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate twinflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms a dense mat of wiry, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, creating a carpet-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, with five petals and a prominent central column. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Circaea decumbens thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
