    "intro": "Cousinia lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cinquefoil, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. Its flowering stems are often branched and can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Cousinia lancifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes."
