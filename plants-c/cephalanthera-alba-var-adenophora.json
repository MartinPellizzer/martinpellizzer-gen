    "intro": "Cephalanthera alba var. adenophora, commonly known as the white helleborine, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its pale green to white, often hairy leaves and a single, showy white or pale yellow flower with a distinctive hooded structure. The plant is typically found in shaded, moist woodlands and is known for its mycorrhizal association with fungi, which aids in nutrient absorption. It blooms in late spring to early summer and is noted for its delicate appearance and ecological significance. This variety is sometimes confused with other white-flowered orchids due to its similar appearance."
