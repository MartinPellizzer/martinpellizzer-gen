    "intro": "Colletia maytenoides, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has adapted to harsh desert conditions with a deep root system and succulent-like leaves that store water. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
