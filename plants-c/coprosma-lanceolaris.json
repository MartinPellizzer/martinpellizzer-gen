    "intro": "Coprosma lanceolaris, commonly known as the narrow-leaved coprosma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, bright red berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Coprosma lanceolaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
