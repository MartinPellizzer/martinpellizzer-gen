It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are typically opposite and sometimes show variations in shape, giving it the name \"heterophylla,\" which refers to the differing leaf forms. This aquatic plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams.

The plant is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to submerged or floating growth habits."
