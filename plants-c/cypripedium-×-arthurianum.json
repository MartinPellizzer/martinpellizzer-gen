    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 arthurianum, commonly known as the Arthurian Lady's Slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy, pinkish-purple flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires well-drained, acidic soil. It has a rhizomatous root system and produces showy, fragrant blooms in late spring. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
