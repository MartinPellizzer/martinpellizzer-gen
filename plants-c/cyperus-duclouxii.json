It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as swamps and floodplains, where it thrives in moist soil conditions. Cyperus duclouxii produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes, which are often clustered at the base of the plant. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland ecosystems."
