    "intro": "Calydermos, commonly known as the golden spire, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a robust root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Calydermos is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
