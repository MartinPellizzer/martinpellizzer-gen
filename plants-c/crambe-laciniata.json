    "intro": "Crambe laciniata, commonly known as the cutleaf crambe, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbages and mustards. The plant features compound leaves with deeply lobed or dissected edges, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. It produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late summer. The plant is often grown as an ornamental due to its attractive foliage and is also used in some agricultural contexts for its oil-rich seeds."
