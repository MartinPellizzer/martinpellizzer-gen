    "intro": "Crepidifolium serawschanicum, commonly known as the Sichuan crepidifolium, is a rare and unique fern native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, fuzzy hairs. The plant typically grows in cool, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
