It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to drought conditions and it is sometimes used in xeriscaping."
