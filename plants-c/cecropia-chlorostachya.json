It is characterized by its smooth, often greenish bark and large, palmate leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by woody pods containing numerous seeds. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing food and shelter for various animals. Its rapid growth makes it a common species in secondary forests and along disturbed areas."
