    "intro": "Centaurea spachii subsp. resupinata, commonly known as the creeping centaury, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a common sight in disturbed or arid environments."
