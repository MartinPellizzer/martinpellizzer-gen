    "intro": "Ctenitis pseudoperrieriana, commonly known as the Pseudoperrier's sea holly, is a rare and unique species of marine plant found in specific coastal environments. It belongs to the family Zosteraceae and is characterized by its delicate, ribbon-like leaves that are adapted to withstand tidal conditions. The plant exhibits a specialized morphology, with a root system that anchors it in sandy or muddy substrates. Its reproductive structures are typically found in the upper parts of the plant, facilitating spore dispersal in the intertidal zone. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
