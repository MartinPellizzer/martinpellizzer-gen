    "intro": "Cola baldwinii, commonly known as African cola or West African cola, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical West Africa and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, red-brown flowers. The plant produces hard, woody pods that contain seeds, and it is often cultivated for its caffeine-containing seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a stimulant. Cola baldwinii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in lowland rainforests. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and cultural contexts in its native region."
