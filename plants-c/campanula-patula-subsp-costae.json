    "intro": "Campanula patula subsp. costae, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically blue to purple in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
