It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbages and mustards. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often preceding the leaves. Its foliage is typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges."
