    "intro": "Carduus uliginosus, commonly known as swamp thistle, is a perennial herb native to wetland areas of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs and often have a bluish-gray hue. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along waterways. Its medicinal properties have been historically used for treating skin conditions and as a diuretic."
