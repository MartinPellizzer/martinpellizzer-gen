It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The leaves are typically dark green to almost black, which gives the plant its distinctive appearance. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. This variety is adapted to harsh, rocky environments and is often found in mountainous areas with poor soil."
