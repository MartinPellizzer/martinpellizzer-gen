    "intro": "Carex filicina var. glaucina, commonly known as the blue-green sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually a bluish-green color, giving it its common name. It produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers in the summer. This variety is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
