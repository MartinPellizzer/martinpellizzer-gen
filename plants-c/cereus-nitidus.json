    "intro": "Cereus nitidus, commonly known as the white star cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a perennial cactus that typically grows as a solitary stem with a globular or cylindrical shape. The plant produces striking white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in low-nutrient, well-drained soils. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry environments."
