    "intro": "Coprosma macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited coprosma, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for native birds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions. Coprosma macrocarpa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
