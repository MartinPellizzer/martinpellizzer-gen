It features tall, arching blades that can grow up to 6 feet in height, with a feathery appearance that adds dramatic visual interest to gardens. The plant produces plumes of soft, silky flowers in late summer, which are highly ornamental and attract birds and pollinators. It prefers full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for perennial borders or as a specimen plant. Its foliage is evergreen, providing year-round texture and color in the landscape."
