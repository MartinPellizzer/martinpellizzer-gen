    "intro": "Ceropegia breviflora, commonly known as the dwarf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent species with fleshy, often swollen stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale green, adapted for pollination by specific insects. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique morphology and resilience make it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
