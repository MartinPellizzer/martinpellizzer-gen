    "intro": "Calyptrotheca somalensis, commonly known as the Somali calyptrotheca, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of Somalia. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
