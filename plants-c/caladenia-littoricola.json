    "intro": "Caladenia littoricola, commonly known as the coastal spider-orchid, is a small terrestrial orchid native to the southern coast of Western Australia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal dunes and rocky outcrops. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a single, narrow, greenish-white flower that has a distinctive spider-like appearance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it blooms during the winter months. The species is adapted to coastal environments, with features that help it withstand salt spray and strong winds."
