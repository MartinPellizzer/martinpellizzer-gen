    "intro": "Coleus engleri, commonly known as the silver leaf coleus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety foliage that ranges from silver to deep purple in color. The leaves are typically ovate to heart-shaped and have a waxy texture. It produces small, tubular flowers that are usually white or pale purple, though they are less showy than the foliage. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
