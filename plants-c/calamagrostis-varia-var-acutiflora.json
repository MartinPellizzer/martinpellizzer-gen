    "intro": "Calamagrostis varia var. acutiflora, commonly known as the silver feather reed grass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It features tall, slender culms that are often covered in silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces panicles of small, pale green to golden spikelets that add ornamental value in late summer and autumn. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its graceful form and unique foliage make it a popular choice for wetland restoration and ornamental gardening."
