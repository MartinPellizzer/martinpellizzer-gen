    "intro": "Cereus \u00d7 splendidus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a hybrid cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and spiny, ribbed structure, which helps it store water in arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. Its succulent leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and protecting it from herbivores. Cereus \u00d7 splendidus thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and indoor cultivation."
