    "intro": "Cirsium palustre, commonly known as swamp thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features tall, spiny stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting large, lobed leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces purple to pinkish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a spherical shape called a \"capitulum.\" Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, often acidic soils. Cirsium palustre plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
