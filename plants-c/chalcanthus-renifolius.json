It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its distinctive kidney-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in crevices of cliffs or on tree trunks, thriving in shaded, humid conditions. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Chalcanthus renifolius plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its ecosystem."
