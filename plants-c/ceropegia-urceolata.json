    "intro": "Ceropegia urceolata, commonly known as the string of hearts, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially in response to sunlight. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale green, attracting specific pollinators like moths. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering to prevent root rot. Its trailing growth habit makes it a popular choice for hanging baskets or as a decorative indoor plant."
