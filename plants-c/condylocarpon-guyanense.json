    "intro": "Condylocarpon guyanense, commonly known as the Guyana condylocarpon, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Verrucariaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically yellowish to orange in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga, and a fungal partner from the genus Condylocarpon. It is often found growing on rocky surfaces in humid tropical environments. This lichen is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and potential applications in biotechnology."
