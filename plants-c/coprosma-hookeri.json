    "intro": "Coprosma hookeri, commonly known as the silver coprosma, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a silvery-gray color, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red berries in the summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Coprosma hookeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in horticulture for its hardy and drought-resistant qualities."
