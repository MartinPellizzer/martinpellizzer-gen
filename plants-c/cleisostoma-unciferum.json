It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, pendulous flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that are often fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental cultivation in warm climates."
