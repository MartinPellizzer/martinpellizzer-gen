    "intro": "Carduus odoratus, commonly known as sweet everlasting, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and purple or pinkish-blue flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and the plant is often found in dry, open habitats. Carduus odoratus is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine."
