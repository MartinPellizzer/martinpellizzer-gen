    "intro": "Carludovica disticha, commonly known as the Mexican devil's backbone, is a striking member of the nightshade family, Solanaceae. Native to Mexico and parts of Central America, it is characterized by its spiny, branching stems and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant produces small, yellow, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
