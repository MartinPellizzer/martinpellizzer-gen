    "intro": "Colea, commonly known as wild garlic, is a flowering plant belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, round berries that are edible but have a strong garlic or onion-like flavor. Colea thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It is valued both for its culinary uses and its role in traditional herbal medicine."
