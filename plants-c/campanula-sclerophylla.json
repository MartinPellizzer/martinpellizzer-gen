    "intro": "Campanula sclerophylla, commonly known as the hard-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features lance-shaped, often grayish-green leaves that are thick and leathery, adapted to withstand dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
