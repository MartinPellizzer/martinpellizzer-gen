    "intro": "Calyptranthes maschalantha, commonly known as the mountain calyptranthes, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its flowers, which are often white or pale pink, bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
