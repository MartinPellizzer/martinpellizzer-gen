    "intro": "Calamagrostis variflora, commonly known as variable reedgrass, is a tall, perennial grass native to the northeastern United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in wet to moist habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife. Calamagrostis variflora is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability to waterlogged conditions."
