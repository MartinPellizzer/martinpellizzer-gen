    "intro": "Cactus recurvispinus, commonly known as the twisted spine cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its adaptations include a succulent structure that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The spines also serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores and help reduce water loss through transpiration."
