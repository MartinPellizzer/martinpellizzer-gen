    "intro": "Conyza inuloides, commonly known as the common ragweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and yellow-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and is known for its allergenic pollen, which can cause significant respiratory issues in humans. Conyza inuloides thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, fields, and waste areas. It has a fibrous root system and can spread through both seeds and vegetative means."
