    "intro": "Cybianthus nemoralis, commonly known as the wood anemone, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has trifoliate leaves with a heart-shaped base. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Cybianthus nemoralis plays an important role in early successional plant communities and supports various pollinators."
