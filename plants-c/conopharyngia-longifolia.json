    "intro": "Conopharyngia longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf conopharyngia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by nocturnal insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
