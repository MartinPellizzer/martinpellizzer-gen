    "intro": "Cyperus badius var. brachystachys, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and small, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
