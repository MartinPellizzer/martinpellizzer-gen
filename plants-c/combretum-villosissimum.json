    "intro": "Combretum villosissimum, commonly known as the white-flowered combretum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark and opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in summer. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that split open to release tiny seeds. It is often found in woodland and savanna habitats, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
