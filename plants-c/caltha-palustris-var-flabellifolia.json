    "intro": "Caltha palustris var. flabellifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh marigold, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features striking yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and have a distinctive waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along stream edges. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining the ecological balance of wetland ecosystems."
