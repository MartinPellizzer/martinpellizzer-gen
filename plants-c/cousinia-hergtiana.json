    "intro": "Cousinia hergtiana, commonly known as the Herget's cushion grass, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a compact inflorescence, typically blooming in the spring. It is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in high-altitude regions with limited water availability. Cousinia hergtiana is often found in alpine and steppe habitats, playing a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
