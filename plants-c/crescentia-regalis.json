    "intro": "Crescentia regalis, commonly known as the royal trumpet tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of yellow or orange. The plant has a distinctive, hollow, branching stem that can grow quite tall, often reaching heights of up to 15 meters. Its leaves are palmate, with five to seven lobes, and the fruit is a fibrous, spiky capsule that contains several seeds. Crescentia regalis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
