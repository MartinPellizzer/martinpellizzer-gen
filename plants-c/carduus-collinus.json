    "intro": "Carduus collinus, commonly known as the common cocklebur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and large, spherical, spiky fruit heads that contain numerous seeds. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry fields, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers are yellow and are visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has been used historically in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
