    "intro": "Cyperus retroflexus var. retroflexus, commonly known as prickly sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has triangular, often hairy stems that grow close to the ground, and its leaves are linear with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown or greenish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily in moist soils, making it a common weed in wetlands and disturbed areas. The species is adapted to a wide range of soil types but prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy substrates."
