    "intro": "Cycas squarrosa, commonly known as the broad-leaf cycad, is a primitive gymnosperm native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, palm-like leaves that are often fan-shaped. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Cycas squarrosa thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is a valuable species for both ecological and ornamental purposes."
