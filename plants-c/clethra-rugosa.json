    "intro": "Clethra rugosa, commonly known as roughleaf clethra, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a rough, textured surface that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in late summer, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Clethra rugosa is valued for its ornamental value and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
