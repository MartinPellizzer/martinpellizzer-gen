    "intro": "Cissus vitiensis, commonly known as the Vitiensis grape ivy, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Vitaceae, characterized by its tendrils that help it climb and attach to surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible berries that are often consumed by local populations. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a slightly succulent texture, adapting to arid environments. Cissus vitiensis is also valued for its ornamental use in landscaping due to its attractive foliage and vigorous growth habit."
