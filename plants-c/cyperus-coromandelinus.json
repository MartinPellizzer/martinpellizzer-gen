    "intro": "Cyperus coromandelinus, commonly known as spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like stems and dense clusters of spikelets. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a common wetland plant and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats. Cyperus coromandelinus is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive appearance and ability to tolerate various water conditions."
