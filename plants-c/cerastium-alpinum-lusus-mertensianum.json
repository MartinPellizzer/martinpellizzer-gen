It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense mats to retain moisture and withstand harsh conditions. Its growth habit and floral structure are adaptations to cold, high-altitude climates. Cerastium alpinum lusus mertensianum is often used in rock gardens and alpine displays due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
