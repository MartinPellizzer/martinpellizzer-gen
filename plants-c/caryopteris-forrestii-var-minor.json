    "intro": "Caryopteris forrestii var. minor, commonly known as the Chinese silver bush, is a compact shrub native to China. It features narrow, silver-gray leaves that are densely packed, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, blue-lilac flowers in late summer, which are clustered in whorls along the stems. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and prolonged flowering period."
