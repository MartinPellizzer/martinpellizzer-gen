    "intro": "Carex collata, commonly known as narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Native to North America, it thrives in moist to wet environments such as marshes and wetlands. The plant has small, wind-pollinated flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems."
