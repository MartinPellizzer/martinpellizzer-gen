    "intro": "Chrysanthemum montanum var. pallens, commonly known as the white mountain chrysanthemum, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features finely divided, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of short, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with white ray florets and yellow disk florets, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and alpine settings."
