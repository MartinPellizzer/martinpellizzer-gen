    "intro": "Corytholoma pusillum, commonly known as the small helmet lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinctive thallus with a leathery texture and a greenish to yellowish coloration. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides it with nutrients through photosynthesis. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate regions. Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is often overlooked but plays a role in ecological succession and soil stabilization."
