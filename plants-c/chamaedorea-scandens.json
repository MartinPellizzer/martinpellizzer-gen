    "intro": "Chamaedorea scandens, commonly known as the climbing cycad, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and feather-like leaves. The plant is typically found growing in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests. It can climb using its fibrous roots, often attaching itself to trees or other structures. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular in horticulture but is also considered vulnerable due to habitat loss."
