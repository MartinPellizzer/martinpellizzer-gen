    "intro": "Calendula spatulata, commonly known as the spoonleaf calendula, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its yellow-orange ray flowers and disc flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands. Its leaves are broadly spoon-shaped, giving it its common name, and it blooms from late spring to early autumn. Calendula spatulata is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
