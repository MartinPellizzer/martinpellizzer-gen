    "intro": "Crepis tenuifolia var. latiloba, commonly known as the broadleaf mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are narrow to broad, depending on the growth conditions. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a common species in ecological studies and a potential indicator of soil type and environmental conditions."
