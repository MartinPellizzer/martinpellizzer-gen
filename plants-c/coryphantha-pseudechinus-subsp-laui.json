It features a globular or cylindrical stem that is typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, edible fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated by cactus enthusiasts."
