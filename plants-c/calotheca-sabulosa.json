    "intro": "Calotheca sabulosa, commonly known as the sand bladderwort, is a small, aquatic plant found in brackish and freshwater environments. It is characterized by its simple, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown in color. It thrives in sandy or muddy substrates and is often found in coastal or inland wetlands. Calotheca sabulosa plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for microscopic aquatic organisms."
