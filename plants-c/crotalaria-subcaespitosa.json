    "intro": "Crotalaria subcaespitosa, commonly known as the clustered crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its legume fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows as an erect or semi-woody shrub with compound leaves and yellow flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in pods, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in dry grasslands. Crotalaria subcaespitosa is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to potential toxicity."
