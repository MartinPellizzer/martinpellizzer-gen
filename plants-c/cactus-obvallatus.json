    "intro": "Cactus obvallatus, commonly known as the globe cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its globular shape and thick, ribbed stems that store water efficiently. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. Its spines are short and sparse, providing minimal protection but allowing for better light penetration. Cactus obvallatus is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient and low-maintenance plant for xeriscaping."
