It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and elliptical leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing a single seed. Canarium secundum is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its durable timber. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and economic contexts."
