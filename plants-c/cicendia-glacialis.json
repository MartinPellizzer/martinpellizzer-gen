    "intro": "Cicendia glacialis, commonly known as the glacier bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in cold, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Cicendia glacialis is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and providing nectar for pollinators."
