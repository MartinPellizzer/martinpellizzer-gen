    "intro": "Cynanchica aristata subsp. calabra, commonly known as Calabrian milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asclepiadaceae. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by follicles containing seeds. It is native to southern Europe, particularly the Calabria region of Italy, and thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
