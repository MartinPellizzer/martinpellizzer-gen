    "intro": "Collaea scarlatina var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the red-flowered collaea, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of southern South America. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
