    "intro": "Cestrum sessiliflorum, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 feet tall, featuring thick, woody stems and dark green, ovate leaves. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that open at night, emitting a strong scent to attract pollinators like moths. Its flowers are typically followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. The plant is adapted to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure."
