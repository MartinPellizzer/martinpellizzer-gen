    "intro": "Coelogyne hologyne, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a rare and visually striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and orange flowers, which bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with limited rainfall. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its unique appearance. Coelogyne hologyne is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its striking floral display."
