    "intro": "Cuscuta iguanella, commonly known as dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It attaches to its host using specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found growing on crops such as corn and beans. It is considered an agricultural pest due to its ability to weaken and damage host plants. Cuscuta iguanella is native to various regions and has been introduced to many parts of the world."
