    "intro": "Centotheca schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's centotheca, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a dry climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
