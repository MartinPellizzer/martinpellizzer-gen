    "intro": "Carex halleriana subsp. basilaris, commonly known as the broad-leaved sedge, is a perennial plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically broader than those of other sedges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland habitats."
