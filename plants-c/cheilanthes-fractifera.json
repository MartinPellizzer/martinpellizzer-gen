    "intro": "Cheilanthes fractifera, commonly known as the fractured fern, is a species of rock fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into small, linear segments. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, typically growing on rocky outcrops or in crevices. It has a short, creeping rhizome and produces spores in compact, rounded clusters. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
