    "intro": "Carduus macracanthus, commonly known as the giant thistle, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, silvery-green leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces showy purple or pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often growing in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its robust nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
