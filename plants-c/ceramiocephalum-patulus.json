    "intro": "Ceramiocephalum patulus, commonly known as the slender sea holly, is a marine flowering plant found in shallow coastal waters. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a short, branching stem with small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its saline environment. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ceramiocephalum patulus plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for small marine organisms."
