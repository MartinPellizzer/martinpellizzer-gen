    "intro": "Copiapoa copiapensis, commonly known as the Copiap\u00f3 cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Atacama Desert in northern Chile. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive ribbed structure and spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow or white flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its thick stems store water, allowing it to survive in the arid environment. Copiapoa copiapensis is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in succulent gardens."
