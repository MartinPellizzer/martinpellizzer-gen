    "intro": "Coryphopteris diversisora, commonly known as the variable fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and have a soft, leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Coryphopteris diversisora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
