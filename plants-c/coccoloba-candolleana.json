    "intro": "Coccoloba candolleana, commonly known as the Caribbean beauty or red mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America, typically found in coastal and wetland environments. The plant is characterized by its striking red, fleshy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, and its seeds are dispersed by water, aiding in its spread along shorelines. The plant's adaptability to saline and waterlogged soils makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
