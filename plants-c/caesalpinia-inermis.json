    "intro": "Caesalpinia inermis, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange inflorescences that resemble flames, which appear during the dry season. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its flowers are typically clustered in dense, terminal spikes. Caesalpinia inermis produces long, narrow pods that contain several seeds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
