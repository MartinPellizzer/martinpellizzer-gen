    "intro": "Cynanchum forskaolianum, commonly known as the wild gourd or bitter nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite leaves that are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by follicles containing numerous seeds. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is known for its toxic properties due to the presence of cardiac glycosides."
