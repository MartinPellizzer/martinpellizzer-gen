It is characterized by its small, dark green, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark purple berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact growth and seasonal interest."
