    "intro": "Conophytum irmae, commonly known as the Irma's conophytum, is a small, succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, rounded leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is often grown as a rock garden plant due to its compact size and ornamental appeal. Conophytum irmae prefers well-draining soil and minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping and dry gardens."
