    "intro": "Cornelia verticillata, commonly known as the whorled milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant is part of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is known for its milky sap, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides. Cornelia verticillata plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
