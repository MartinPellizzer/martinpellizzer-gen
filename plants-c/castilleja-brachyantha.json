    "intro": "Castilleja brachyantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright orange to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed sites. Castilleja brachyantha plays a role in supporting pollinators and contributes to the ecological diversity of its native environment."
