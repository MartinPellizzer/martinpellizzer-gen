It features compound leaves with three to five lance-shaped leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in many regions."
