    "intro": "Cola chlamydantha, commonly known as the white cola or white coffee bean plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly West Africa, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit is a capsule containing several seeds, which are used to produce a stimulant beverage similar to coffee. Cola chlamydantha is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its foliage rather than its seeds."
