    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 pomelana, commonly known as the pink lemonate, is a hybrid citrus fruit resulting from the cross between a grapefruit and a lemon. It is characterized by its unique pinkish-orange color and a balanced flavor profile that combines the tartness of a lemon with the sweetness of a grapefruit. The fruit typically has a thick, leathery rind and segmented pulp that is juicy and aromatic. It is primarily grown in subtropical climates and is valued for both its culinary and ornamental uses. The plant itself is a small evergreen tree with glossy leaves and has a moderate growth rate."
