    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 krylowii, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive pouch-like lip that serves as a pollination trap. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
