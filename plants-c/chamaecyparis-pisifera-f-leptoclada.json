It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and finely cut, needle-like foliage that gives it a feathery appearance. The plant has scale-like leaves that are closely arranged along the branches, contributing to its compact and elegant form. It is native to Japan and is often cultivated as an ornamental tree in gardens and landscapes. This variety is valued for its slow growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
