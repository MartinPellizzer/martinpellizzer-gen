It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its pendulous, showy inflorescences that bear clusters of pink to purple flowers. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a velvety texture and a distinctive waxy coating. This variety is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to add a dramatic floral display in shaded garden settings."
