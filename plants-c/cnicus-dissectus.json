    "intro": "Cnicus dissectus, commonly known as the dissected thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a cluster of small flowers. The plant has finely divided, silvery-green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are typically yellow, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. Cnicus dissectus is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant for its distinctive foliage."
