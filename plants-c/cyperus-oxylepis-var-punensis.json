    "intro": "Cyperus oxylepis var. punensis, commonly known as the Punjabi flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often found in rice fields and along water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of flowers. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense vegetation. This species is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
