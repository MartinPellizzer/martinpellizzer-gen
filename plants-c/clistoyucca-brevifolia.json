    "intro": "Clistoyucca brevifolia, commonly known as the shortleaf clistoyucca, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Clistoyuccaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the early summer months. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
