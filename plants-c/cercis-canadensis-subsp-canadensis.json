    "intro": "Cercis canadensis subsp. canadensis, commonly known as the eastern redbud, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces flat, elongated pods that contain one or two seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. The eastern redbud is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
