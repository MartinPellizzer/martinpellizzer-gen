    "intro": "Cenchrus americanus, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a grass species native to the United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and dunes. Its leaves are narrow and wiry, with a bluish-green color, and it is drought-tolerant. Sand dropseed is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
