It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or pink, especially when exposed to adequate light. The plant thrives in soft, acidic water with moderate to high light conditions. It is a popular choice for planted aquariums due to its ornamental appearance and ease of care. Its rhizome system allows it to spread and form dense, lush growths in the substrate."
