    "intro": "Chorisia speciosa var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf silk tree, is a shrub-like variant of the silk tree, native to Brazil. It features striking, palmate leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a reddish or purplish tint. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. Its small size makes it suitable for smaller gardens or container planting. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in full sun to partial shade."
