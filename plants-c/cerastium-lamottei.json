    "intro": "Cerastium lamottei, commonly known as the Lamotte's mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Cerastium lamottei is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, ground-covering mats."
