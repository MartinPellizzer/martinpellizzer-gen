    "intro": "Cassia babylonica, commonly known as the Persian cassia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, followed by long, slender pods that contain several seeds. Cassia babylonica thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for arid climates. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and showy blooms, which make it a popular choice in gardens and landscapes."
