    "intro": "Crataegus compitalis, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pinkish flowers in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds and some mammals but are generally not consumed by humans. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. The common hawthorn plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
