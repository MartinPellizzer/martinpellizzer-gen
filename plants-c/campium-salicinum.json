    "intro": "Campium salicinum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed willow or narrow-leaved willow, is a species of flowering plant in the Salicaceae family. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. The plant is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, and it produces samaras as its seed dispersal method. Campium salicinum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges."
