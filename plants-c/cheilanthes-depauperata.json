    "intro": "Cheilanthes depauperata, commonly known as the poor fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, thin fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found growing on limestone or sandstone. Due to its low water requirements, it is well adapted to drought conditions and is considered a xerophytic species."
