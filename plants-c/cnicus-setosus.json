    "intro": "Cnicus setosus, commonly known as the hairy thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, spiny stems. The plant features silver-gray, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Cnicus setosus is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in rocky or sandy habitats."
