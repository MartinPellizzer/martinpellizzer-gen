    "intro": "Cylindropuntia exaltata, commonly known as the horse collars, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are segmented and covered in sharp spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to poor soil conditions. This plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
