It is characterized by its dark purple to black flowers, which contrast with its gray-green foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind. The subspecies is distinguished by its darker flower color compared to the typical form of Centaurea jacea."
