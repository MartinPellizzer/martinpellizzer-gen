    "intro": "Casearia stipularis, commonly known as the tropical beautyberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purple underneath. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but generally unpalatable to humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
