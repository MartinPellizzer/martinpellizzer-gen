    "intro": "Cymbidium xiphophyllum, commonly known as the sword orchid, is a hybrid orchid species that originates from the cross between Cymbidium goeringii and Cymbidium lowianum. It is characterized by its long, sword-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, orchid-like flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant is evergreen and thrives in cool, humid environments with bright, indirect light. It requires well-draining soil and moderate watering to prevent root rot. Cymbidium xiphophyllum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and as a potted plant."
