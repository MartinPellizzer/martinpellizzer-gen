    "intro": "Convolvulus cantabrica var. villosus, commonly known as the hairy bindweed, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its varietal name. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pink or lilac in color. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and waste ground. Its rapid growth and persistent nature make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed."
