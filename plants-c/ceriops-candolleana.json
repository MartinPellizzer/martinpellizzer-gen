    "intro": "Ceriops candolleana, commonly known as the mangrove apple or red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as mangrove forests. The plant has prop roots that help stabilize the soil and filter salt from the water. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and it produces edible red berries. The tree plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for various species."
