    "intro": "Chenopodium \u00d7 drucei, commonly known as tumbleweed, is a flowering plant in the amaranth family (Amaranthaceae). It is a hybrid species that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its sprawling growth habit and production of dry, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant has a prostrate or ascending stem covered with small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces small greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, papery seed heads that easily detach and carry seeds over long distances. This adaptability makes it a common invasive species in many parts of the world."
