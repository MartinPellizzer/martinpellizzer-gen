    "intro": "Cotyledon polycephala, commonly known as the \"Cape fig\" or \"Cape buttercup,\" is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Cotyledon polycephala is a hardy species that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a desirable ornamental plant."
