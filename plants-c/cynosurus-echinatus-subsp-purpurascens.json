    "intro": "Cynosurus echinatus subsp. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-haired fescue, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and distinctive purple-tinted inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitats."
