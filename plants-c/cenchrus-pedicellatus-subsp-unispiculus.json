    "intro": "Cenchrus pedicellatus subsp. unispiculus, commonly known as the spikegrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in poor, sandy conditions. Its fibrous roots make it a useful plant for erosion control in certain environments."
