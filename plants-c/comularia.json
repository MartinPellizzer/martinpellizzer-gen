    "intro": "Comularia, commonly known as sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by spiny, leaf-like bracts. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in saline environments. Comularia species are often used in coastal landscaping due to their hardiness and ornamental value. They play a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in maritime regions."
