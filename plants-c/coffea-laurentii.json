    "intro": "Coffea laurentii, commonly known as the Laurenti coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red berries that contain two seeds, which are used to make coffee. It is a rare and lesser-known species compared to more common coffee varieties like Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a unique subject of botanical study."
