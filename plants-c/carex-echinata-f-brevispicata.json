    "intro": "Carex echinata f. brevispicata, commonly known as the short-spiked sedges, is a compact, clump-forming sedge native to wet or moist habitats in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green, and its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of short, spike-like structures. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, which are usually inconspicuous and clustered in the upper part of the inflorescence. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in bogs, wet meadows, and along stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its shorter and more compact spikes compared to the typical form of Carex echinata."
