    "intro": "Carya ovalis subsp. australis, commonly known as the Australian hickory, is a deciduous tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside, and its compound fruit, which consists of a spiny husk enclosing several edible nuts. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, with a broad, rounded crown. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates, often found in forested areas and along riverbanks. This subspecies is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also an important source of food for wildlife."
