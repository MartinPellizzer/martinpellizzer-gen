    "intro": "Colubrina glandulosa var. antillana, commonly known as the Antillean beautyberry, is a shrub native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its clusters of small, showy purple berries that persist through the winter, providing food for birds and other wildlife. The plant has opposite, simple leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a suitable ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions. The berries are not only visually appealing but also have mild medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices."
