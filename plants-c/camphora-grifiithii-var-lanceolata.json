The tree produces small, white flowers that are followed by oval, woody fruits containing aromatic seeds. Its bark is thick and deeply fissured, often exuding a camphor-like scent when cut. This plant is valued for its medicinal properties and is also used in traditional crafts and as a source of essential oils."
