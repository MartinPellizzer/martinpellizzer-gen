    "intro": "Corydalis gymnopoda, commonly known as the naked-stem corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and clusters of delicate, pinkish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, preferring well-drained soils and partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, while its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Corydalis gymnopoda is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, early-blooming flowers."
