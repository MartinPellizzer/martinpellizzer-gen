    "intro": "Crocus tournefortianus, commonly known as the Persian crocus, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a parent species in the development of many hybrid crocus varieties."
