    "intro": "Cynorkis jumelleana var. jumelleana, commonly known as the Jumellean's cycad, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
