    "intro": "Cassiope pulvinalis, commonly known as the alpine cassiope, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the alpine regions of the Pacific Northwest. It features dense, needle-like leaves that are typically a vibrant green, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in open, rocky habitats. Cassiope pulvinalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in mountainous areas."
