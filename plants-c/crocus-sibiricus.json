    "intro": "Crocus sibiricus, commonly known as the Siberian crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces striking violet or blue flowers with a distinctive, sweet fragrance, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is well adapted to cold climates, often thriving in rocky or sandy soils. Its bulbs are relatively small and store nutrients to support growth during dormancy. The Siberian crocus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its early blooming habit."
