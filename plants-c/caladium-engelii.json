    "intro": "Caladium engelii, commonly known as the red-veined caladium, is a tropical perennial plant native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that display vibrant red veins against a deep green background. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining, fertile soil. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes. Caladium engelii typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet and produces small, white flowers that are less showy than its foliage."
