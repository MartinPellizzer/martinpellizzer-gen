    "intro": "Coleocephalocereus uebelmanniorum, commonly known as the Uebelmann's moon cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its swollen, bottle-shaped stem that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is highly sought after by collectors and requires specific care to thrive."
