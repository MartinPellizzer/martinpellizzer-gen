    "intro": "Corallorhiza trifida subsp. virescens, commonly known as the green fairy. This orchid is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it derives its nutrients from fungal networks rather than through photosynthesis. It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, resulting in a pale green to white coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands, forming a dense rosette of lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive, spurred structure that aids in pollination by insects."
