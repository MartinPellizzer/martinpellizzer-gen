It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often reddish-colored stems. The plant produces spikelets that are typically pale green to reddish-brown, with narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in nutrient-poor, moist to wet soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its botanical features make it an important component of tundra and mountain ecosystems."
