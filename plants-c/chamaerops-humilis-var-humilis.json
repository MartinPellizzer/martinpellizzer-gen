    "intro": "Chamaerops humilis var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf date palm, is a small, cold-hardy palm native to the Mediterranean region. It features a slender trunk and is often used as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and attractive, fan-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, edible dates in its natural habitat, though it is rarely cultivated for this purpose outside its native range. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its resilience to coastal conditions makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
