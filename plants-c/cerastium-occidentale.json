    "intro": "Cerastium occidentale, commonly known as western mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features small, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in the spring. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks, roadsides, and in meadows. It is part of the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes other flowering plants with similar floral structures. Cerastium occidentale is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
