    "intro": "Chenopodium caroxylon, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit, with woody stems that often branch near the base. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a rough, sandpaper-like texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. Chenopodium caroxylon plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
