    "intro": "Cassia abbreviata var. granitica, commonly known as the granite cassia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. This resilient species is well-suited to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy addition to xeriscapic gardens."
