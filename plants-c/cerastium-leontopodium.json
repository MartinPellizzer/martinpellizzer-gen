    "intro": "Cerastium leontopodium, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, often in dense clusters. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly areas. Cerastium leontopodium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
