    "intro": "Campanula alpini var. asperula, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The leaves are typically lanceolate and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude environment. This species thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
