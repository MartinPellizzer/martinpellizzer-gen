    "intro": "Calydorea basaltica, commonly known as the basalt rock orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific volcanic regions. It is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils found in rocky or basaltic environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb minerals from the mineral-rich substrates. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
