    "intro": "Carex pseudocyperus f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf swamp sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous brownish flowers in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist to waterlogged soils and is often found in areas with poor drainage. Its compact form and ability to tolerate saturated conditions make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
