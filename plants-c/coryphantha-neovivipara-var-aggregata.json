    "intro": "Coryphantha neovivipara var. aggregata, commonly known as the clustered live-bearing cactus, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular stems that often form dense clusters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically followed by the development of live seeds rather than mature fruits. Its fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The varietal form 'aggregata' is distinguished by its tendency to form tight clusters, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
