It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and large, showy purple or blue composite flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped, rough to the touch, and often have a waxy coating.
