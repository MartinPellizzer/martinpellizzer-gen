    "intro": "Cordia anisodonta, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its clusters of white, fleshy flowers that resemble snowballs, blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Cordia anisodonta is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
