    "intro": "Calliandra pauciflora, commonly known as the small-flowered calliandra, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features compound leaves with numerous small, oval leaflets that are often arranged in pairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fluffy, pink to red flowers, which are borne along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Calliandra pauciflora is often used in ornamental gardening and can also serve as a nitrogen-fixing plant in agroforestry systems."
