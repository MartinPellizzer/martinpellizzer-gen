    "intro": "Collandra atronitens, commonly known as the black-leaved collandra, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, glossy foliage that ranges from deep green to nearly black, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white or pale yellow, which bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are leathery and have a waxy surface, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Collandra atronitens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
