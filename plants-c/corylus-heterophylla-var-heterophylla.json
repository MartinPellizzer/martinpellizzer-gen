    "intro": "Corylus heterophylla var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with some leaves being entire and others lobed, depending on the growth conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by edible, hazelnut-like fruits that mature in late summer. Its leaves are typically alternate, ovate to elliptic, and have a serrated margin. This species is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
