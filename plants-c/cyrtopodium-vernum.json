    "intro": "Cyrtopodium vernum, commonly known as the Christmas orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is a terrestrial herb with a pseudobulb that supports its growth and storage of nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers during the winter months, typically from December to February. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often growing in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb. Cyrtopodium vernum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
