    "intro": "Chrysosplenium album, commonly known as white chrysosplenium, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Saxifragaceae family. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Native to moist, shaded habitats in temperate regions, it thrives in woodland and streamside environments. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to form compact, mat-like growths."
