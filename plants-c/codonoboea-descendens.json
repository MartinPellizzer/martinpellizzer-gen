    "intro": "Codonoboea descendens, commonly known as the descending codonopsis, is a flowering plant belonging to the Acanthaceae family. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia, where it thrives in tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and is of interest to researchers studying tropical flora."
