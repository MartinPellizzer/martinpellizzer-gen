It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
