    "intro": "Castilleja brunnescens, commonly known as the brown bract castilleja, is a hemiparasitic plant found primarily in the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant is characterized by its reddish to brownish flowers and is often found in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. It plays a role in local ecosystems by influencing plant community composition and providing nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
