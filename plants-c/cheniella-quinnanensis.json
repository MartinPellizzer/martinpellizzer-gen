    "intro": "Cheniella quinnanensis, commonly known as the Quinnanese Cheniella, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and lanceolate, with a slightly hairy texture. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cheniella quinnanensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
