    "intro": "Cotoneaster atrovirens, commonly known as the dark green cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, dark green leaves that turn reddish-brown in autumn. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is often used in garden borders and as a hedge plant."
