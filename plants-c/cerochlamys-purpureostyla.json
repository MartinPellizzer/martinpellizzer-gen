It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand and Vietnam. The plant is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers that display a vibrant mix of purple and pink hues. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
