    "intro": "Cyathea parvula, commonly known as the dwarf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its short, robust trunk and a crown of feathery, light green fronds. The plant grows slowly and can reach heights of up to 2 meters in optimal conditions. Its fronds are typically pinnately compound, with a smooth, glossy surface. Cyathea parvula is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shady, humid environments."
