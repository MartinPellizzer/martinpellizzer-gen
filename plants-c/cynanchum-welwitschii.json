It is characterized by its erect stem, lance-shaped leaves, and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces toxic latex, which contains cardiac glycosides, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. Its ecological role includes providing habitat for certain insects and serving as a food source for specific wildlife."
