    "intro": "Caucalis capitata, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense basal cluster. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically arranged in a single terminal inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Caucalis capitata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
