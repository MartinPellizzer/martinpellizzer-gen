It is a small, terrestrial herb characterized by its compact growth habit and unique floral structure. The plant produces intricate, spurred orchid flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, with a distinct lip petal. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China, where it thrives in shaded, moist forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
