    "intro": "Calamagrostis caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its clump-forming growth habit and tall, slender stems that produce feathery panicles of small, greenish-brown flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, meadows, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Calamagrostis caespitosa is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support wildlife in wetland ecosystems."
