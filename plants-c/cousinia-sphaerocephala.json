It is characterized by its compact, spherical inflorescence that resembles a small globe, composed of numerous small, pink to purple flowers. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Cousinia sphaerocephala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens."
