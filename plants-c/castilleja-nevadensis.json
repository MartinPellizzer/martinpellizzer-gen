    "intro": "Castilleja nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra red globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. Castilleja nevadensis typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
