    "intro": "Calamus siberutensis, commonly known as Siberut rattan, is a climbing palm native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its long, flexible stems used for making furniture and crafts. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by fruit that contains a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
