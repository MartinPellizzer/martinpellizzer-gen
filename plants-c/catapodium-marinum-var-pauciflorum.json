    "intro": "Catapodium marinum var. pauciflorum, commonly known as the sea couchgrass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear few flowers, consistent with its varietal name \"pauciflorum.\" It thrives in coastal areas and salt marshes, where it helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its botanical resilience makes it an important species in salt-tolerant ecosystems."
