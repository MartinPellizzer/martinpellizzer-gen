It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking purple to pink flowers with distinctive white markings. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and it produces numerous small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind.

It is also known for its ability to spread aggressively, making it both a valuable wildflower and a potential invasive species."
