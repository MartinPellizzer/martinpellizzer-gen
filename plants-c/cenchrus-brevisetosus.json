    "intro": "Cenchrus brevisetosus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with fine hairs along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in sandy soils with low moisture availability. Due to its resilience, it is often found in disturbed or degraded habitats, playing a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion."
