    "intro": "Calyptranthes mirabilis, commonly known as the silverleaf calyptranthes, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its narrow, silvery-gray leaves that provide a striking contrast to its dark green veins. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy areas. Calyptranthes mirabilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native gardens."
