    "intro": "Cardamine sarmentosa, commonly known as creeping watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The small, white flowers are borne in clusters and are followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods."
