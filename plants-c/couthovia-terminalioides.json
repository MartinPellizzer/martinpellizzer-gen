    "intro": "Couthovia terminalioides, commonly known as the silverleaf couthovia, is a striking member of the Couthovia family, native to the temperate rainforests of the western coast of the continent. It is characterized by its silvery, velvety foliage that reflects light, giving it a unique appearance in shaded environments. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the late spring and early summer. Its roots are fibrous and well adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in moist, rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
