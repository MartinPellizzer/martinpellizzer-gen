    "intro": "Cousinia rudis, commonly known as the rough cousine, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is known for its tufted growth habit and produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. Cousinia rudis typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat."
