    "intro": "Colletia spinosa var. armata, commonly known as the hairy candelabra cactus, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its branched, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its succulent leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This variety is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and semi-desert habitats."
