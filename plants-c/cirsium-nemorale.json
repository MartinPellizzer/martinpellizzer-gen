    "intro": "Cirsium nemorale, commonly known as wood thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in woodland areas and along stream banks, preferring moist, well-drained soils. The plant features a tall, sparsely branched stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height. Its leaves are lance-shaped, deeply lobed, and covered in stiff, prickly hairs. The flowers are purple to pink, with a distinctive, spiky appearance, and bloom in late summer."
