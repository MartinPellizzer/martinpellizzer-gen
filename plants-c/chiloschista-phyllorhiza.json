    "intro": "Chiloschista phyllorhiza, commonly known as the broad-leafed chiloschista, is a rare and unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces striking, spurred orchid flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
