    "intro": "Cynanchum gracillimum, commonly known as slender milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its fruit is a follicle containing toxic latex. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh environmental conditions. Due to its toxicity, it is not typically used in traditional medicine or horticulture."
