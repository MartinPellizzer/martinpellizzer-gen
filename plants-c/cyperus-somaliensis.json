    "intro": "Cyperus somaliensis, commonly known as the Somali flatsedge, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and flowering spikes that produce small, three-lobed flowers. Native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields, due to its tolerance for harsh environmental conditions. Its ecological role includes providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to soil stabilization in dry landscapes."
