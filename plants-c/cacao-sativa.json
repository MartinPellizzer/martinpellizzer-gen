    "intro": "Cacao sativa, commonly known as the cacao tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It produces pods containing seeds, which are the source of cocoa mass used in chocolate production. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil and consistent temperatures. Its leaves are large, elliptical, and dark green, while its flowers grow directly on the trunk and branches. The fruit, which matures over several months, is essential for harvesting the beans used in various food products."
