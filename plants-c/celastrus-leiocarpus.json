It is characterized by its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright purple berries in the fall. The plant has opposite, simple leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. Its berries are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife. The eastern beautyberry is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
