    "intro": "Cymatochloa repens, commonly known as the creeping grass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It features slender, rhizomatous stems that spread along the ground, forming dense mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Cymatochloa repens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
