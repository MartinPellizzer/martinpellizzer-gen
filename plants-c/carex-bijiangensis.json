It is native to China and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
