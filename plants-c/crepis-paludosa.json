    "intro": "Crepis paludosa, commonly known as the marsh hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a single head, surrounded by pale green to brown bracts. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to thrive in moist, often boggy environments. Crepis paludosa is often found in marshes, meadows, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
