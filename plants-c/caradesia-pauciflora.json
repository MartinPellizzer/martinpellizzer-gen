It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
