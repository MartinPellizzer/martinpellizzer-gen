    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 thersites, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in mountainous regions. It has a long flowering period, usually from late spring to early summer, and is known for its ornamental value in horticulture. However, it is also considered a rare and endangered species in many areas due to habitat loss and over-collection."
