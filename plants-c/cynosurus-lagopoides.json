    "intro": "Cynosurus lagopoides, commonly known as the hare's-tail grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and distinctive, fluffy seed heads that resemble a hare's tail, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Cynosurus lagopoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
