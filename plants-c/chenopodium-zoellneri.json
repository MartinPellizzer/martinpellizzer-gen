    "intro": "Chenopodium zoellneri, commonly known as desert goosefoot, is a flowering plant species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Chenopodium zoellneri is adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments and is often found in disturbed soils. It is also known for its edible leaves, which have a slightly tart flavor and are used in traditional cuisine by some indigenous communities."
