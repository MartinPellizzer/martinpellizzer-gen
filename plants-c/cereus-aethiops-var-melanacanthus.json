    "intro": "Cereus aethiops var. melanacanthus, commonly known as the black spined night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The dark, sharp spines are a distinguishing feature, providing protection from herbivores."
