    "intro": "Castilleja arachnoidea subsp. saltensis, commonly known as the saltbush castilleja, is a hemiparasitic plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and hairy, often succulent stems. The plant forms specialized structures called haustoria to attach to the roots of host plants, drawing water and nutrients. It typically grows in sandy or saline soils, often in association with shrubs like saltbush. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of desert ecosystems."
