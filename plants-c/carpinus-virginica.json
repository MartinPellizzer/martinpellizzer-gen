    "intro": "Carpinus virginica, commonly known as the American hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, elongated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by oval, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests. The American hornbeam is valued for its hard, dense wood and its ability to thrive in shaded environments."
