It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense, flowering clusters that are typically white or pale yellow, distinguishing it from other Carex species. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
