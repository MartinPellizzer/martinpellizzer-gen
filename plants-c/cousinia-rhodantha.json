    "intro": "Cousinia rhodantha, commonly known as the pink spurge or red spurge, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cousinia rhodantha is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
