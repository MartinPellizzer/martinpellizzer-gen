    "intro": "Cactus parvispinus, commonly known as the small-spined cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of short, pale spines. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and bloom in the spring. Cactus parvispinus is adapted to full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
