    "intro": "Coryanthes angelantha, commonly known as the angel's crown, is a striking tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, intricate floral structures that resemble a crown, with a central spadix surrounded by a colorful perianth. The plant produces nectar-rich flowers that attract specific pollinators, such as certain species of flies and beetles. Its growth is epiphytic, meaning it thrives by growing on other plants without parasitizing them. The botanical features of Coryanthes angelantha make it a unique and visually appealing addition to botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
