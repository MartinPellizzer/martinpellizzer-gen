It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible seeds. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, narrow leaves, and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
