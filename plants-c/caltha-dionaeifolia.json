    "intro": "Caltha dionaeifolia, commonly known as the golden ragwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often appearing before the leaves fully develop. The plant has dark green, palmately lobed leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Caltha dionaeifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
