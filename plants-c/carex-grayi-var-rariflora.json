    "intro": "Carex grayi var. rariflora, commonly known as the rare-flowered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, typical of many sedges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
