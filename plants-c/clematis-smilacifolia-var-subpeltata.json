    "intro": "Clematis smilacifolia var. subpeltata, commonly known as the western clematis, is a deciduous vine native to the western United States. It features compound leaves with three to five elliptical leaflets that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems are twining and can grow quite long, allowing it to climb and trail along structures. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds."
