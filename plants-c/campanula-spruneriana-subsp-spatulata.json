    "intro": "Campanula spruneriana subsp. spatulata, commonly known as the spoon-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are broad and spatulate, giving the plant its common name, and they are often hairy to the touch. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or alpine beds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable climates."
