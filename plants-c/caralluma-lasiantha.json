    "intro": "Caralluma lasiantha, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its fleshy, spine-tipped stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom at night. The plant is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves and stems. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Caralluma lasiantha is also known for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
