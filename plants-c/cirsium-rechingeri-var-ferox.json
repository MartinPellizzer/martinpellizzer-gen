It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its robust structure and defensive spines are adaptations to its harsh, cold climate. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and ecological importance in its native habitat."
