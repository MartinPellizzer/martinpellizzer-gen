It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many species with cruciform flowers. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent-like leaves that help it conserve water. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often growing in harsh, semi-desert environments. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
