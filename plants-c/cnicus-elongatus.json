    "intro": "Cnicus elongatus, commonly known as the slender sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and has a low, spreading growth habit. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow and arranged in a single head. Cnicus elongatus is often considered a weed but can serve as a food source for certain insects and small animals."
