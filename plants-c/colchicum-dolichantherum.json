    "intro": "Colchicum dolichantherum, commonly known as the long-flowered autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant features a bulbous corm, which serves as its primary storage organ and allows it to survive in harsh conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, emerging after the flowers have faded. The plant is also notable for its medicinal properties, though it contains toxic compounds that require careful handling."
