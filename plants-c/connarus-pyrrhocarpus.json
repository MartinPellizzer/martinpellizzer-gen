    "intro": "Connarus pyrrhocarpus, commonly known as the red-fruited connarus, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Connaraceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and distinctive red, woody fruits. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. Its fruits, which are covered in a thick, reddish exocarp, are an important food source for various bird and mammal species. The tree is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used traditionally in construction and tool-making."
