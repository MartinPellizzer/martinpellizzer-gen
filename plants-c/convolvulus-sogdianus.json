    "intro": "Convolvulus sogdianus, commonly known as the Sogdian bindweed, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its stems are trailing or climbing, often forming dense mats. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a hairy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment."
