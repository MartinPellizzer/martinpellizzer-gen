    "intro": "Cynoglossum germanicum subsp. pellucidum, commonly known as the translucent bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to central and eastern Europe. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with purple. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom from late summer to early autumn. Its subspecies distinction is primarily based on the translucent, waxy coating on the leaves, which gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
