    "intro": "Cephalocereus minensis, commonly known as the Minas night-blooming cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a tall, columnar cactus with a distinctive crown of spines at the top. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in arid gardens and collections."
