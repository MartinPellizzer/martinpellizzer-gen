    "intro": "Carradoria, commonly known as the bluebell of the Canary Islands, is a flowering plant native to the island of Tenerife. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue-violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapting to the unique volcanic soil of its native habitat. Carradoria has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
