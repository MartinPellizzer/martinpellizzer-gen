It is a columnar cactus characterized by its grayish-green stems covered in short, white spines. The plant produces large, showy night-blooming flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its striking appearance and unique blooming habit, it is a popular choice for succulent gardens and indoor collections."
