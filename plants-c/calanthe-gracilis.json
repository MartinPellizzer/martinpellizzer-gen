    "intro": "Calanthe gracilis, commonly known as the slender calanthe, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, which is common in its natural habitat. Calanthe gracilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
