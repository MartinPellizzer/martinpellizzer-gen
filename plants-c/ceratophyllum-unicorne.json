    "intro": "Ceratophyllum unicorne, commonly known as the spike milfoil, is a unique aquatic plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth and its distinctive, unbranched stems that bear small, rounded leaves. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming thick mats on the water surface. Its flowers are tiny and clustered, typically appearing in late summer, and it is known for its ability to oxygenate water. Ceratophyllum unicorne is often used in aquariums and ponds for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
