    "intro": "Caladenia postea, commonly known as the pink fairy orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, showy pink or pale purple flower. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils in open habitats, often in heathlands or woodlands. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and fragmentation."
