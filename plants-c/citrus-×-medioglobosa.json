    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 medioglobosa, commonly known as the trifoliate orange. It is a hybrid citrus species originating from the cross between the common orange (Citrus sinensis) and the trifoliate orange (Citrus trifoliata). This plant is characterized by its small, sour fruits and its ability to thrive in a variety of climates. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they have three leaflets, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The plant is often used as a rootstock in citrus cultivation due to its resistance to certain diseases."
