    "intro": "Casearia capitata, commonly known as the white bead tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white, bead-like flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has simple, alternate, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green in color. Its fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Casearia capitata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
