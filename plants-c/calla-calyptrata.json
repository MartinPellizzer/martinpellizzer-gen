    "intro": "Calla calyptrata, commonly known as the white calla lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to parts of Africa. It features a tall, slender stem with a single, white, spathe-like flower that resembles a cup or trumpet. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its leaves are broad and arrow-shaped, floating on the water's surface or emerging from the water. Calla calyptrata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in water gardens."
