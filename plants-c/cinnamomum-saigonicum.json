    "intro": "Cinnamomum saigonicum, commonly known as the Saigon cinnamon or Vietnamese cinnamon, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark reddish-brown bark, which is harvested for its spice. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by egg-shaped berries that contain winged seeds. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and have a strong, camphor-like scent. This species is closely related to other cinnamon trees but is distinguished by its unique bark and growth habits."
