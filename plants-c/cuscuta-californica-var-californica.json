    "intro": "Cuscuta californica var. californica, commonly known as the California dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants. The plant is native to California and thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and disturbed areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural and ornamental plants."
