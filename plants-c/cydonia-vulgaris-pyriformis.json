    "intro": "Cydonia vulgaris pyriformis, commonly known as the Persian apple or quince, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces fragrant, yellowish flowers in the spring, which give way to oval, green fruits that ripen to a golden-orange color in the fall. The fruit has a tough, leathery skin and a sweet, aromatic flesh when fully mature. It is often used in cooking, particularly in jams, jellies, and baked goods. The plant is valued for its ornamental value and historical significance in traditional medicine."
