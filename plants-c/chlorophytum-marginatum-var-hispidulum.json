    "intro": "Chlorophytum marginatum var. hispidulum, commonly known as the curly spider plant, is a compact, evergreen perennial that features rosettes of narrow, dark green leaves with a distinctive white or light green margin. It produces long, arching inflorescences bearing small, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant is native to South Africa and is well adapted to arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ease of care, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
