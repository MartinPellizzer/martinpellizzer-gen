    "intro": "Claoxylon anomalum, commonly known as the Malayan ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptic in shape and have a glossy surface. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
