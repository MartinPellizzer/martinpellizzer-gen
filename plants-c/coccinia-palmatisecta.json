    "intro": "Coccinia palmatisecta, commonly known as the palmately lobed morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with deeply lobed margins. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or white in color. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rapid growth and climbing habit make it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive in non-native habitats."
