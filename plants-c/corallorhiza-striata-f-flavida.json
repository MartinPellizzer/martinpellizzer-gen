    "intro": "Corallorhiza striata f. flavida, commonly known as the yellow coralroot, is an epiphytic orchid native to the eastern United States. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients, making it a hemiparasitic plant. The species features a slender, often branched stem covered in small, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are typically pink or yellow, with a tubular shape and spurred petals. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and forest floors."
