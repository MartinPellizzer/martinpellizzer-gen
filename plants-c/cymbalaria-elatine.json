    "intro": "Cymbalaria elatine, commonly known as the small white-flowered bedstraw, is a herbaceous annual plant belonging to the family Primulaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit, with hairy stems and alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetlands. Cymbalaria elatine is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize areas quickly, making it both a pioneer species and a potential weed."
