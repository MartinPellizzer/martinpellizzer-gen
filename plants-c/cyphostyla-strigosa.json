    "intro": "Cyphostyla strigosa, commonly known as the rough-stemmed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap aquatic prey. The plant typically grows in shallow water, where it uses its submerged leaves to capture tiny organisms. Its stems are often covered in fine, hair-like structures that give it a rough texture. Cyphostyla strigosa plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling within its aquatic habitat."
