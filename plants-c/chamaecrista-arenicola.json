    "intro": "Chamaecrista arenicola, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with slender, branching stems and small, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Chamaecrista arenicola is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
