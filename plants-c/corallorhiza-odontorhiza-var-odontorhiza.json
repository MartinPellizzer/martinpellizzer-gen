    "intro": "Corallorhiza odontorhiza var. odontorhiza, commonly known as the toothroot coralroot, is a root-parasitic orchid that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale green or brownish leaves. The plant produces clusters of tubular, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with hardwood trees. Due to its parasitic nature and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in many regions."
