    "intro": "Claoxylon affine, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its hard, dense wood and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in lowland forests and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, while the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Claoxylon affine is valued for its durable timber and is often used in construction and furniture-making."
