    "intro": "Cyclodium alansmithii, commonly known as the San Diego cyclodium, is a rare flowering plant native to southern California. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheats and knotweeds. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to coastal and inland scrub environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
