    "intro": "Cactus stellatus, commonly known as the star cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped spines and segmented stems that store water efficiently. The plant typically grows in clusters, forming a compact, bushy appearance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months. Cactus stellatus is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in desert environments."
