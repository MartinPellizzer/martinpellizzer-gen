    "intro": "Ctenitis speciosa, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that radiate from a central trunk, giving it a striking appearance. The plant has a slow growth rate and thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-draining soil. Its fronds are typically bright green, with a subtle golden hue on the underside, contributing to its ornamental value. Ctenitis speciosa is often cultivated as a decorative plant in botanical gardens and tropical landscapes."
