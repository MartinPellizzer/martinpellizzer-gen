    "intro": "Cambessedesia adamantium var. minor, commonly known as the lesser diamondleaf, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves with a distinctive diamond-shaped venation pattern. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in montane forests. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing nectar that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
