    "intro": "Ceanothus peduncularis, commonly known as the coast ceanothus, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It features small, clustered blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has aromatic, waxy leaves that are often gray-green in color, providing a distinctive visual contrast. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild, wet winters and dry summers. Ceanothus peduncularis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
