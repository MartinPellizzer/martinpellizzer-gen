    "intro": "Cerasus avium var. flore-pleno, commonly known as the double-flowered wild cherry, is a cultivar of the Prunus avium species. It is characterized by its dense, double blooms that cover the tree in a profusion of white to pink flowers, giving it a more ornamental appearance than the typical single-flowered wild cherry. The plant is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree with a rounded crown and smooth, grey bark. Its flowers appear in early spring before the leaves, and it produces small, edible cherries that are generally less flavorful than those of other cultivars. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
