It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the rocky soil in which it grows. Cleistocactus fusiflorus is a slow-growing plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil."
