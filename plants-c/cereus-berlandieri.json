    "intro": "Cereus berlandieri, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cacti species native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and its ability to produce large, fragrant white flowers at night. The plant thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowering period typically occurs in the summer months, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Cereus berlandieri is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and striking appearance."
