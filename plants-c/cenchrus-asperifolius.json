    "intro": "Cenchrus asperifolius, commonly known as roughleaf sandgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its narrow, rigid leaves with a rough, sandpaper-like texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or disturbed areas. Its adaptability makes it an important component of stabilizing ecosystems in harsh climates."
