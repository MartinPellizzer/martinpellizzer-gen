    "intro": "Cynanchum ellipticum, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family, known for its milkweed species, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by follicles containing toxic, sticky seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky areas, and is often found in the central and eastern United States. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
