    "intro": "Ceratopteris thalictroides subsp. gaudichaudii, commonly known as the Gaudichaud's water fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, finger-like segments. The plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
