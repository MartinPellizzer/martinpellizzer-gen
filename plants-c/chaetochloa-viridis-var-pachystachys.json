    "intro": "Chaetochloa viridis var. pachystachys, commonly known as the broad-stemmed green millet, is a variant of the green millet species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a perennial grass characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, greenish flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or near water bodies. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening or as a cover crop."
