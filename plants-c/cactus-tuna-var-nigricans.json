    "intro": "Cactus tuna var. nigricans, commonly known as the black cactus tuna, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dark green, spiny stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and protecting it from herbivores. The fruit, which is edible, is a small, red, fleshy berry that contains several seeds."
