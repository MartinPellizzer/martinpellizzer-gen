    "intro": "Colea colei, commonly known as the dwarf pincushion cactus, is a small, flowering cactus native to southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 10 centimeters and features dense clusters of spiny, rounded stems. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in both indoor and outdoor settings."
