    "intro": "Cystopteris regia f. latiloba, commonly known as the broad-leafed royal water fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds and reproductive structures. It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The fronds are typically broad and have a bipinnate structure, with small, rounded pinnae that give it a lacy appearance. The sori, which contain the spores, are located on the underside of the fronds and are arranged in a linear pattern. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
