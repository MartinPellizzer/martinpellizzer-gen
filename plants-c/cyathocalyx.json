    "intro": "Cyathocalyx, commonly known as the cup-shaped calyx, is a botanical structure found in certain flowering plants, particularly in the family Cucurbitaceae. It is a modified leaf that encloses the flower and serves as a protective covering. The cyathocalyx is often mistaken for a flower itself due to its cup-like appearance. It typically consists of several fused leaf-like structures that form a tubular or cup-shaped envelope. This unique feature plays a role in attracting pollinators and protecting the reproductive organs of the plant."
