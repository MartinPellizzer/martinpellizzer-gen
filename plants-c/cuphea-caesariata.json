It is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescences that bear vibrant red bracts, which are not petals but modified leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for garden borders and containers. Cuphea caesariata is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
