    "intro": "Chenopodium glaucum var. prostratum, commonly known as bluestem goosefoot, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It has prostrate or decumbent stems that hug the ground, often forming dense mats. The leaves are generally ovate to deltoid in shape, with a bluish-green color and a rough, sandpapery texture. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, and the fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule containing several seeds. This plant is adapted to harsh environments and is often found in disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural settings."
