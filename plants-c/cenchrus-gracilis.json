    "intro": "Cenchrus gracilis, commonly known as slender fingergrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in dry, open habitats. Its fibrous root system makes it a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
