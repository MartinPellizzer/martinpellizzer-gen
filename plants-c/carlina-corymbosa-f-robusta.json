    "intro": "Carlina corymbosa f. robusta, commonly known as the robust carline thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy composite flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for rocky or alpine gardens. The robust form of this plant is notable for its increased stature and more abundant flowering compared to the typical species."
