    "intro": "Campanula scheuchzeri subsp. pseudostenocodon, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a rare and frost-tolerant plant native to high-altitude regions of the Alps. It features showy, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
