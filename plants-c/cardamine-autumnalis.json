    "intro": "Cardamine autumnalis, commonly known as autumn sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a smooth, glossy surface and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early to mid-summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
