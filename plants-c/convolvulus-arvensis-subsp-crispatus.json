    "intro": "Convolvulus arvensis subsp. crispatus, commonly known as the hairy field bindweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its trailing growth habit and distinctive, heart-shaped leaves. It produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, giving it a rough texture, and it is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. It is a member of the bindweed family (Convolvulaceae) and is known for its aggressive growth and ability to spread through rhizomes. This subspecies is often considered a weed due to its persistent nature and ability to colonize various habitats."
