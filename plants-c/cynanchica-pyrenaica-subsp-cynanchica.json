    "intro": "Cynanchica pyrenaica subsp. cynanchica, commonly known as the Pyrenean milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
