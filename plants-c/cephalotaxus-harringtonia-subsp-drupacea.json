    "intro": "Cephalotaxus harringtonia subsp. drupacea, commonly known as the Chinese yew or Drupaceae yew, is a rare and distinctive evergreen conifer native to China. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that contain a single seed. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
