    "intro": "Cannabis kafiristanica, commonly known as the Afghan hemp, is a wild variety of the Cannabis sativa species. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly the Kafiristan valley in Afghanistan. This plant is characterized by its tall stature, often reaching up to 5 meters in height, and its long, narrow leaves. It produces small, greenish-brown flowers that are typically dioecious, with separate male and female plants. The plant contains varying levels of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), making it of interest for both traditional use and scientific research."
