It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that form a crown at the top. The plant produces a distinctive fruit, the coconut, which contains both a liquid endosperm and a hard, fibrous husk. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in coastal and sandy soils. The coconut palm plays a significant role in tropical ecosystems and human cultures."
