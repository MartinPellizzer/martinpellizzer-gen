    "intro": "Craniospermum canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial with silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves and fibrous roots enable it to survive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils. Craniospermum canescens is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
