    "intro": "Cenchrus glaucus, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage due to the dense covering of fine hairs on its leaves and stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in arid climates."
