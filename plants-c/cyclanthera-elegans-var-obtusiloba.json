It is a climbing vine characterized by its elongated, cylindrical fruits that are typically green and covered with sparse, soft hairs. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a smooth or slightly lobed margin. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are borne in clusters along the stems. It is valued in some regions for its edible fruits, which have a mild, cucumber-like flavor."
