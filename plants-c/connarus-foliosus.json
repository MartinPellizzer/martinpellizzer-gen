It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant produces small, round fruits that enclose a single seed, which is often dispersed by wind or animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
