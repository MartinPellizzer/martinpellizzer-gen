    "intro": "Croton ceanothifolius var. itabirensis, commonly known as the Itabire Croton, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in an alternate pattern along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in understory layers of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
