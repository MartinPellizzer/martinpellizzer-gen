    "intro": "Cleanthes, commonly known as gravelroot, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. These plants are native to North America and are characterized by their hairy stems and showy blue or violet flowers. They typically grow in rocky or sandy soils and are often found in open habitats such as prairies and meadows. Cleanthes species are perennial herbs that produce small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Many species are cultivated for their ornamental value and are adapted to drought conditions."
