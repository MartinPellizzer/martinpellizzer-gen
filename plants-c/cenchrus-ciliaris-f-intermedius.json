    "intro": "Cenchrus ciliaris f. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves with hairy margins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. This grass is often used for forage and soil stabilization in marginal environments."
