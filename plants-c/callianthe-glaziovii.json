    "intro": "Callianthe glaziovii, commonly known as the Glaziov's pincushion, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiky flower heads that resemble a pincushion, with vibrant yellow or orange ray flowers surrounding a central disk. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Callianthe glaziovii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
