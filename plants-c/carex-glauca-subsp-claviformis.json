    "intro": "Carex glauca subsp. claviformis, commonly known as blue sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a bluish-green color, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
