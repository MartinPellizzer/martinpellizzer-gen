    "intro": "Chlorospatha plowmanii, commonly known as the Plowman's green fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
