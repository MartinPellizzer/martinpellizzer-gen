    "intro": "Cheilanthes argentea var. chrysophylla, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shiny, golden-green fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky, shaded environments, thriving in humid and cool conditions. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself in crevices. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, lance-shaped pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal."
