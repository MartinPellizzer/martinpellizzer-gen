    "intro": "Calyptranthes bimarginata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf calyptranthes, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It belongs to the family Theaceae, which includes camellias and other ornamental plants. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and typically white or pale yellow, appearing in clusters during the spring and summer months. Calyptranthes bimarginata is well adapted to coastal climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
