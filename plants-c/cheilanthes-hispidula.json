    "intro": "Cheilanthes hispidula, commonly known as the hairy rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and hairy, leathery fronds. The plant thrives in rocky crevices and is adapted to low moisture conditions, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the undersides of the fronds. Cheilanthes hispidula is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
