    "intro": "Cystopteris fragilis var. aprica, commonly known as the spring brittle bladder fern, is a delicate fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its finely divided, frond-like leaves that are typically light green and have a brittle texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its rapid growth and short lifespan make it a common indicator species in early successional habitats."
