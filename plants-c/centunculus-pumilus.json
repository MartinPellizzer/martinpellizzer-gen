    "intro": "Centunculus pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf sandcatcher, is a small flowering plant native to the sandy soils of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are small, linear, and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it to conserve moisture in its arid habitat. Centunculus pumilus is often found in open, disturbed areas such as dunes and gravelly soils, where it thrives in full sun."
