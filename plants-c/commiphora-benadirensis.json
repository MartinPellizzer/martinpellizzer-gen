It is native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its aromatic resin, which has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties. It typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree with smooth, grayish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The flowers are small and yellowish, often clustered in inflorescences, and the plant produces a gum resin that is similar to myrrh."
