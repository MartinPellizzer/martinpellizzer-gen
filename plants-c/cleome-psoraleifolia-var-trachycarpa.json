    "intro": "Cleome psoraleifolia var. trachycarpa, commonly known as the rough-seeded cleome, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring upright stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a rough texture due to the presence of stiff, glandular hairs. The fruit is a cylindrical capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the wild."
