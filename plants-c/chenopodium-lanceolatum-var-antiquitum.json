    "intro": "Chenopodium lanceolatum var. antiquitum, commonly known as ancient goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and arid landscapes. This species is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
