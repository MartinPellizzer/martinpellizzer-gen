    "intro": "Codiaeum williamsii, commonly known as flameleaf or croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, variegated leaves that display shades of red, orange, yellow, and green. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its striking foliage rather than its flowers. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Codiaeum williamsii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and indoor spaces."
