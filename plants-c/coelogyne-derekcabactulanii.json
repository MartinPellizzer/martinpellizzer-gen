    "intro": "Coelogyne derekcabactulanii, commonly known as the Derek Cabactulan Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, fragrant flowers that bloom in a striking array of colors, often including red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat, and features long, strap-like leaves. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
