    "intro": "Carpodinus camptoloba, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It has small, leathery leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while it photosynthesizes for additional energy. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and influencing host tree growth."
