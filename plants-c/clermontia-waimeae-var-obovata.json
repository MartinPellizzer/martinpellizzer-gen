    "intro": "Clermontia waimeae var. obovata, commonly known as the Waimea obovate \u02bb\u012bhi\u02bbi, is a rare endemic species found primarily in the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive obovate-shaped leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its conservation status is critically endangered due to habitat loss and invasive species. This unique plant is an important part of Hawaii's native flora and requires careful protection to ensure its survival."
