It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers with four petals. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and has slender, branching stems. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. The flowers open in the morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty."
