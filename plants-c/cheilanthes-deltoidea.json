    "intro": "Cheilanthes deltoidea, commonly known as the delta fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a distinctive, deltoid-shaped frond that is deeply divided into narrow, linear segments. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery leaves and is often found in crevices or on rock faces. Cheilanthes deltoidea is well adapted to drought conditions and can survive in poor soil conditions due to its specialized root system."
