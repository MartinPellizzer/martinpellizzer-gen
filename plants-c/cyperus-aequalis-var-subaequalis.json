    "intro": "Cyperus aequalis var. subaequalis, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in dense tufts, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively, making it a common species in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
