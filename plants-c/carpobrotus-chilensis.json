    "intro": "Carpobrotus chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean ice plant, is a succulent species native to South America. It is characterized by its fleshy, trailing stems and thick, waxy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant pink or red flowers during the spring and summer months. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it often forms dense mats that stabilize sandy soils. Carpobrotus chilensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in coastal ecosystems."
