    "intro": "Cissus lanea, commonly known as the rock fig or African snowball, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Vitaceae and is characterized by its trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, which give it its common name. Its fruits are edible and resemble small figs, though they are not related to true figs. Cissus lanea is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
