    "intro": "Clematis viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered clematis, is a deciduous vine native to eastern Asia. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, which are usually ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces showy, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its climbing habit is facilitated by its twining stems, which allow it to ascend supports. Clematis viridiflora is valued in gardens for its unique foliage and delicate floral display."
