    "intro": "Celtis australis var. eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly boxwood, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a soft, woolly layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by small, round, woody fruits that are typically retained on the plant for an extended period. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in woodland edges and scrublands. The variety is distinguished by its more robust and hairy foliage compared to the typical form of Celtis australis."
