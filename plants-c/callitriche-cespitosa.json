It typically grows in shallow water, often in ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has small, star-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in whorls around the stem. It produces tiny white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Callitriche cespitosa is often found in moist soils and can spread through stolons, forming dense mats."
