    "intro": "Crataegus pruinosa var. latisepala, commonly known as the broad-sepal hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, often reddish bark and oval, glossy leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but tart. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal."
