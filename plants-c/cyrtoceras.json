    "intro": "Cyrtoceras, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Plumbagaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive blue or purple flowers and succulent, often spiny leaves. They are native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands, where they thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Cyrtoceras species are typically herbaceous perennials, though some may have a shrub-like growth form. Their botanical features make them popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to tolerate saline conditions."
