It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikes of flowers. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
