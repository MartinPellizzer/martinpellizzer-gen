    "intro": "Caragana angustissima, commonly known as the narrowleaf bitterbrush, is a deciduous shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in poor soils and limited water conditions. Caragana angustissima plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
