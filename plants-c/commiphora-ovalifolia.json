    "intro": "Commiphora ovalifolia, commonly known as the African myrrh, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its lanceolate, leathery leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its bark and resin have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Commiphora ovalifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats."
