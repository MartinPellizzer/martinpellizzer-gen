    "intro": "Chamaefistula bacillaris, commonly known as the creeping spindle tree, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring. Its woody stems are often prostrate, allowing it to spread along the ground. Chamaefistula bacillaris is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
