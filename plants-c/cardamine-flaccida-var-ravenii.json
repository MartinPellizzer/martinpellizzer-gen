It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in woodland undergrowth. The plant features delicate, fern-like leaves and small white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its flowers are borne on slender, upright stems and are often clustered in groups of three. The species is characterized by its short stature and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora."
