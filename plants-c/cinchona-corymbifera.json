    "intro": "Cinchona corymbifera, commonly known as the clustered quinine tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in countries like Colombia and Peru. The plant is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers, which bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are elliptical and have a slightly waxy texture, while its bark contains alkaloids, including quinine, which has historically been used in medicine. This species plays an important role in both ecological systems and traditional herbal practices."
