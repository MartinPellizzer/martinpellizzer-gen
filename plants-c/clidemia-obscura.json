    "intro": "Clidemia obscura, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a red or purple calyx. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Clidemia obscura is often found in forest understories and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
