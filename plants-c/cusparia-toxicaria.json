    "intro": "Cusparia toxicaria, commonly known as the deadly nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dark purple berries and bell-shaped flowers that bloom in summer. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, such as atropine and scopolamine, which can be harmful if ingested. Its leaves are alternate and have a rough texture, while its stems are hairy and branching. Despite its toxicity, it has been used historically in medicine and as a hallucinogen."
