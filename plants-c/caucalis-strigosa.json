    "intro": "Caucalis strigosa, commonly known as the hairy caucalis, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Caucalis strigosa is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
