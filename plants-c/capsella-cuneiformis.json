    "intro": "Capsella cuneiformis, commonly known as the heartweed or mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like mustard and cabbage. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring small, alternate leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its seeds are small and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils. Capsella cuneiformis is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas where it can establish itself quickly."
