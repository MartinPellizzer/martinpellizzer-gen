    "intro": "Carex muricata var. contigua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial sedge native to wetland environments in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. This species plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
