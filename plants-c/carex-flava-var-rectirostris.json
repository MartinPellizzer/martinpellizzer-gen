    "intro": "Carex flava var. rectirostris, commonly known as the narrow-beaked yellow sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in marshy or swampy areas, and is adapted to wetland environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a yellowish-green color, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers in the summer. This variety is distinguished by its elongated, narrow bracts that give it its common name."
