    "intro": "Camarotis obliquirostris, commonly known as the oblique-nosed moth, is a species of moth belonging to the family Pyralidae. It is characterized by its slender body and wings that are typically pale yellow to brown in color. The larvae of this species feed on grasses and are often found in open habitats such as meadows and pastures. The plant's botanical relevance lies in its role as a host for these larvae, contributing to the ecological balance of grassland ecosystems. Its life cycle is closely tied to the seasonal growth of its preferred plant hosts."
