    "intro": "Carpha, commonly known as flat grass or flatleaf grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. These plants are typically found in moist or wetland environments, often growing in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Carpha species are characterized by their flat, wide leaves and spike-like inflorescences that contain small, two-lobed flowers. They play an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Some species are also used in ornamental gardening due to their attractive foliage and adaptability to wet conditions."
