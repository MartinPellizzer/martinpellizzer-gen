It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often variegated with shades of green and white. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in the spring. Its vigorous growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
