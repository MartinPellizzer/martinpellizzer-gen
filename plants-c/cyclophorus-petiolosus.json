    "intro": "Cyclophorus petiolosus, commonly known as the leafy spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are extensive and can spread rapidly, making it an invasive species in some regions. Cyclophorus petiolosus is adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives in dry, disturbed environments."
