    "intro": "Cylindrolobus longissimus, commonly known as the long-stemmed burrweed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish in color, followed by oval, spiny fruits. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some areas."
