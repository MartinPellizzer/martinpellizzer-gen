    "intro": "Cephalosorus leptocladus, commonly known as the slender-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Cephalosorus leptocladus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
