    "intro": "Cardamine pratensis subsp. pratensis, commonly known as lesser celandine, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves that form a dense mat on the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common but sometimes invasive species in wet habitats."
