    "intro": "Cerastium fallax, commonly known as the creeping snowberry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate habit, with stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by bright red berries that persist into late summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its frost-resistant nature. Cerastium fallax is often used in rock gardens or as ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
