    "intro": "Cakile geniculata, commonly known as the bent-leaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its leaves are typically lobed and often appear to be bent or twisted, giving it its common name. Cakile geniculata is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots and a succulent stem that helps it conserve water."
