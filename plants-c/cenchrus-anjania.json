    "intro": "Cenchrus anjania, commonly known as the African grass or white panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale green spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in disturbed soils. Cenchrus anjania is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in erosion control."
