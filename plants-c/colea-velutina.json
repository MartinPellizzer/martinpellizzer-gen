    "intro": "Colea velutina, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain environments. Colea velutina is valued for its ornamental qualities but requires well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth."
