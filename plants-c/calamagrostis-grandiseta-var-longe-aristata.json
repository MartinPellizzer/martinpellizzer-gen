    "intro": "Calamagrostis grandiseta var. longe-aristata, commonly known as the long-awned bluejoint grass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and distinctive, blue-green foliage that adds a striking visual appeal to gardens and natural landscapes. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are typically brown or tan in color, and it thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense clumps, making it a popular choice for erosion control and habitat restoration. The variety's long, slender awns contribute to its unique appearance and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
