    "intro": "Centrostegia thurberi var. macrotheca, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its vine-like growth habit and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in dry conditions. Its flowers open in the morning and close in the afternoon, a trait that gives it its common name. The species is also notable for its ability to thrive in sandy soils and its role in providing nectar for pollinators."
