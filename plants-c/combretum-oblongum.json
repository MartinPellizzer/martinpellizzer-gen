    "intro": "Combretum oblongum, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its striking, fiery red flowers that appear in clusters during the dry season. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, woody fruits that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and woodland areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
