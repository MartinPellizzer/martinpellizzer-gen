    "intro": "Crocus biflorus subsp. caricus, commonly known as the Carpathian crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Carpathian Mountains. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 cm and produces showy, violet-blue flowers with six petals. The plant blooms in early spring, often before the leaves emerge, and is adapted to cold, mountainous environments. Its bulbs are relatively small and contain nutrients stored for the next growing season. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
