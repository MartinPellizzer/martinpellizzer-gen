    "intro": "Citrus glauca, commonly known as the desert lime, is a small evergreen tree native to arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of India. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and fragrant, yellow-orange fruits that are rich in vitamin C. The plant is well adapted to hot, dry climates and can thrive with minimal water. Its fruit is often used in cooking and traditional medicine. The tree's ornamental value also makes it a popular choice for landscaping in drought-prone areas."
