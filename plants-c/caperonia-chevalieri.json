    "intro": "Caperonia chevalieri, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of California and Nevada. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It is a perennial herb that thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in meadows and forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
