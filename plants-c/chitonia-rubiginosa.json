    "intro": "Chitonia rubiginosa, commonly known as the red chiton, is a species of sea snail belonging to the family Chitonidae. It is characterized by its distinctive, calcareous shell that is often reddish in color, providing camouflage in its marine environment. The shell is composed of multiple overlapping plates, which offer protection against predators. This species is typically found in intertidal zones, where it adheres to rocks using a muscular foot. Its diet consists mainly of algae, which it scrapes off surfaces using a radula."
