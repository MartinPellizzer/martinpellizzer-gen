    "intro": "Carex flacca var. basigyna, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. The inflorescence consists of two distinct spikelets, with the lower one being shorter and more compact than the upper one."
