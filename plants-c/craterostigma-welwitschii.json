    "intro": "Craterostigma welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia mirabilis, is a unique plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia and Angola. It is characterized by its two large, leathery leaves that can grow up to three meters in length. The plant has a short, thick stem and produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its seeds are enclosed in woody capsules and are dispersed by wind. Craterostigma welwitschii is also notable for its ability to survive extreme arid conditions due to its specialized adaptations."
