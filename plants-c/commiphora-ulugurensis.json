    "intro": "Commiphora ulugurensis, commonly known as the Uluguru myrrh tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the Uluguru Mountains in Tanzania. It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic resinous sap, which is used in traditional medicine. The plant has simple, opposite leaves and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
