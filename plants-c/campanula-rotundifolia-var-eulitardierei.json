    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia var. eulitardierei, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces showy, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The leaves are rounded and often covered in a fine, downy coating, which helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. This variety is adapted to cold climates and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
