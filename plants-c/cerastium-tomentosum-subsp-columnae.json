It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, grayish-green leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its compact form and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
