    "intro": "Coix lacryma-jobi var. minor, commonly known as Job's tears, is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is native to East Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, tear-shaped caryopsis, which is often used in traditional medicine and as a food source. The plant produces small, slender spikes that bear the edible seeds, which are enclosed in a fibrous husk. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant typically grows in moist, fertile soils. It is valued for its nutritional content, including high levels of starch and protein, and has been cultivated for thousands of years."
