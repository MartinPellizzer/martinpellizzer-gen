    "intro": "Cyathea villosa, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a fibrous, hairy layer that gives it its common name. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Cyathea villosa typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its unique appearance and ability to grow in humid conditions make it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture."
