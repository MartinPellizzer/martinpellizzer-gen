It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. This evergreen shrub is characterized by its striking, tubular red flowers that bloom in clusters. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a waxy texture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
