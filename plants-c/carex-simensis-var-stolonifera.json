    "intro": "Carex simensis var. stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known for their rhizomatous growth habits. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variety is characterized by its stoloniferous growth, which allows it to spread and form dense mats."
