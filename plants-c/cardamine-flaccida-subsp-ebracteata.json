    "intro": "Cardamine flaccida subsp. ebracteata, commonly known as the slender water crowfoot, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five sepals and numerous stamens, typical of the genus Cardamine. It thrives in moist to aquatic habitats such as ponds, ditches, and stream edges. Its subspecies ebracteata is distinguished by the absence of bracts on the flowering stems, a feature that aids in its identification."
