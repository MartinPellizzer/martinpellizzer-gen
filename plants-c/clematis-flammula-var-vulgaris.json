    "intro": "Clematis flammula var. vulgaris, commonly known as the yellow clematis, is a deciduous vine native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, twining stems that can reach lengths of up to 10 meters, allowing it to climb and spread across various supports. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow to cream, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a finely toothed margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Clematis flammula var. vulgaris thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, fertile soil."
