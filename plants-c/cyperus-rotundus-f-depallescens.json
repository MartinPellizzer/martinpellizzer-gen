It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features slender, triangular stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are usually shorter and more narrow compared to the typical form of Cyperus rotundus. This botanical variant is notable for its adaptability to various soil conditions and its role in wetland ecosystems."
