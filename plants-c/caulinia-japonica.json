    "intro": "Caulinia japonica, commonly known as the Japanese velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats. Caulinia japonica has been studied for its potential medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices."
