    "intro": "Cyperus breviradiatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flatsedge, is a species of flowering plant in the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flower heads. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes and wetlands. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common component of aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
