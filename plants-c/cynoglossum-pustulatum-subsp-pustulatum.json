    "intro": "Cynoglossum pustulatum subsp. pustulatum, commonly known as the blister bugloss, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry meadows, rocky soils, and open woodlands, thriving in full sun to partial shade. The plant is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its scientific name reflects its distinctive leaf shape (\"cynoglossum\" meaning \"dog's tongue\") and the presence of pustules on the leaves. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
