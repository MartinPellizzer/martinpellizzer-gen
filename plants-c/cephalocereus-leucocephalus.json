    "intro": "Cephalocereus leucocephalus, commonly known as the white-headed cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces white, fluffy flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. The plant is often cultivated for its striking appearance and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
