    "intro": "Celastrus saxatilis, commonly known as the rock elder, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and have a distinct, slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. Its woody stems are often covered with a rough, fissured bark, and it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Celastrus saxatilis is often found in woodland edges and rocky slopes, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
