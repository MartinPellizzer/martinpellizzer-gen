    "intro": "Calamus vanuatuensis, commonly known as the Vanuatu rattan, is a climbing palm native to the tropical regions of Vanuatu. It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its long, flexible stems used for making baskets and other crafts. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are large, pinnate, and often used in traditional practices by local communities. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
