    "intro": "Corothamnus medius, commonly known as the narrowleaf thimbleweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense, thimble-like heads, giving it its common name. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
