    "intro": "Calamus heteroideus, commonly known as the slender calamus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. The plant is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruit is a three-lobed, spiny drupe. Calamus heteroideus is valued not only for its ornamental qualities but also for its role in local ecosystems and cultural practices."
