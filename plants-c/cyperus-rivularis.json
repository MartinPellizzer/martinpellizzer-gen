    "intro": "Cyperus rivularis, commonly known as the marsh flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its slender, grass-like stems are usually clustered and bear small, three-ranked spikelets. Cyperus rivularis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
