    "intro": "Cotyledon linguiformis, commonly known as the tongue-shaped cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with red or purple hues, especially when exposed to sunlight. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, upright stems. Its leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to store water efficiently in arid environments. Cotyledon linguiformis is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements."
