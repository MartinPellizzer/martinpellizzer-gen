    "intro": "Cyperus aureovillosus, commonly known as the golden hairgrass, is a species of sedge native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation. Cyperus aureovillosus is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
