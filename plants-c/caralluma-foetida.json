    "intro": "Caralluma foetida, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and India. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its spiny, ribbed stems that store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and moths. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, reducing water loss through transpiration. Caralluma foetida is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and adaptability to low-water conditions."
