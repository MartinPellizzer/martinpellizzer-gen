    "intro": "Commelina rajmahlensis, commonly known as the Rajmahl's spiderwort, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Commelinaceae family, which includes many species of flowering plants known for their striking blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or wetlands. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. The flowers are small and clustered, often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts, which can be colorful and attract pollinators."
