    "intro": "Callisia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, while its flowers are small and clustered in a cup-like structure. Callisia angustifolia is often found in desert and scrub habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects."
