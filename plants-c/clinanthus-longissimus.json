    "intro": "Clinanthus longissimus, commonly known as the long-stemmed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and requires high humidity and well-drained soil.
