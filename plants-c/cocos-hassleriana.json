    "intro": "Cocos hassleriana, commonly known as the Hassler's coconut, is a rare and unique species of palm native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces an edible fruit similar to that of the coconut, though it is less commonly cultivated. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for botanical research and conservation efforts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
