    "intro": "Corymbis veratrifolia, commonly known as the lace fern, is a delicate flowering plant native to tropical regions. It features slender, arching stems covered in finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a lacy appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in loose, open clusters called corymbs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens where it adds a graceful, ethereal touch."
