    "intro": "Codonoboea reptans var. monticola, commonly known as the mountain codonoboea, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant produces bright orange or yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often covered with fine hairs, adapting to the cool, moist conditions of its mountainous habitat. This variant is distinguished by its more compact growth compared to the typical form of Codonoboea reptans."
