    "intro": "Cactus sulcolanatus, commonly known as the zigzag cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, ribbed stems that form a zigzag pattern, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its spines are short and dense, providing protection from herbivores while also reducing transpiration. Cactus sulcolanatus is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun."
