    "intro": "Cressa depressa, commonly known as the creeping cress, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically features small, bright green leaves that are rounded or heart-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. Cressa depressa is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance and ability to spread through runners."
