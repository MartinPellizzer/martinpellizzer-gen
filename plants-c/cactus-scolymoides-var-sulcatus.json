    "intro": "Cactus scolymoides var. sulcatus, commonly known as the zigzag cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, ribbed stems that form a zigzag pattern, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, making it well adapted to survive in desert conditions. The variety sulcatus is distinguished by its deep grooves and ridges, which contribute to its unique appearance."
