    "intro": "Cyclosorus fengii, commonly known as the Feng's cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically divided into four lobes, resembling a four-leaf clover. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. Its reproductive structures include sporocarps that release spores for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality and ecological health."
