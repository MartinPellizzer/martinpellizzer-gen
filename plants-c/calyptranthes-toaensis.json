    "intro": "Calyptranthes toaensis, commonly known as the Toaensis mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus Ficus. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces fragrant, white flowers that are clustered in umbels. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
