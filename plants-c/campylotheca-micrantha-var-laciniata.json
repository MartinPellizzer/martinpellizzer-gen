    "intro": "Campylotheca micrantha var. laciniata, commonly known as the serrated campylotheca, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed or serrated. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on the branches. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, a common dispersal mechanism in the Rutaceae family. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
