    "intro": "Crepidium protractum, commonly known as the elongated beard orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, slender spike bearing a single, pale green to brownish flower. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils in open habitats. It blooms during the late spring to early summer, producing a unique floral structure with a labellum that is often adorned with fine, hair-like appendages. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
