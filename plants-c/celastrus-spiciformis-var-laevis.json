    "intro": "Celastrus spiciformis var. laevis, commonly known as the smooth prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and opposite, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and along streams. Its ornamental value and ecological role make it a notable species in native plant gardens."
