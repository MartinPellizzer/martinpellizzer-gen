    "intro": "Carex archeri, commonly known as the Sierra marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, wetland environments such as marshes and stream banks. The plant features grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and narrow, with a dense, compact growth habit. Its flowering spikes are usually shorter than the leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers. Carex archeri is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
