    "intro": "Cardamine muscosa, commonly known as the mossy water-crowfoot, is a small perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, moss-like hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a raceme, typically blooming in early spring. Cardamine muscosa thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks, wet meadows, and rocky areas. Its botanical features make it well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
