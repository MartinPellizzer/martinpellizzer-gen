    "intro": "Cyperus fucatus, commonly known as the marsh clubmoss, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. Native to wetland and marshy environments, it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-lobed, three-angled fruits. Its growth habit and ecological role make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
