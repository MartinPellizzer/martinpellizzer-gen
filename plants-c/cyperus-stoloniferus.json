    "intro": "Cyperus stoloniferus, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy, growing in dense clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered in a loose panicle. Cyperus stoloniferus thrives in wet or moist soils, making it a common sight in marshy areas and along waterways. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming extensive colonies in suitable habitats."
