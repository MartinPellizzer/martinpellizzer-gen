    "intro": "Colletia obcordata, commonly known as the woolly candelabra cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its branched, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically clustered at the ends of its branches. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to dry environments. Colletia obcordata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
