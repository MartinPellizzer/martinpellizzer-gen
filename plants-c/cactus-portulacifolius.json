    "intro": "Cactus portulacifolius, commonly known as the Indian fig cactus, is a species native to arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, pink or red flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Overall, it is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant well adapted to desert and semi-desert conditions."
