    "intro": "Crataegus misella, commonly known as the dwarf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, white or pinkish flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus misella thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and rocky areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
