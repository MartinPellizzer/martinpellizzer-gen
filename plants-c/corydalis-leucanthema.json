    "intro": "Corydalis leucanthema, commonly known as the white-flowered corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, often pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Corydalis leucanthema is typically found in shaded, moist environments such as woodland areas and rocky slopes. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
