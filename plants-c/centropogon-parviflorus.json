    "intro": "Centropogon parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered centropogon, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of small, brightly colored blooms, often in shades of red or orange, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Centropogon parviflorus is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical gardens."
