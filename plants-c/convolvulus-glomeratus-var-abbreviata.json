    "intro": "Convolvulus glomeratus var. abbreviata, commonly known as the dwarf bindweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its small, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gardens."
