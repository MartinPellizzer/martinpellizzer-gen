It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other mustard family plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and linear leaves adapted to conserve water. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Due to its resilience to harsh conditions, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats."
