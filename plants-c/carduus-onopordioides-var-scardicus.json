    "intro": "Carduus onopordioides var. scardicus, commonly known as the Scardic thistle, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowering heads that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
