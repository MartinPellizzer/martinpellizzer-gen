    "intro": "Campylospermum vogelii, commonly known as the velvetleaf tree, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain regions."
