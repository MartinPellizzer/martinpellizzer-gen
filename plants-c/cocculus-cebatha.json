    "intro": "Cocculus cebatha, commonly known as the Indian devil's backbone, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Menispermaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by bright red berries that contain toxic seeds. Its botanical features include a complex root system and a distinctive, angular stem structure. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or medicinal purposes."
