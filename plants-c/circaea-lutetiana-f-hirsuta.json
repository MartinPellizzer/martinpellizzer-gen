    "intro": "Circaea lutetiana f. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy wood-sorrel, is a variant of the wood-sorrel species native to Europe and parts of Asia. This plant is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which gives it its common name. It produces clusters of yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in early spring. The hairy wood-sorrel thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and often sought-after plant in horticulture and botanical gardens."
