    "intro": "Carex stellulata f. excelsior, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a variant of the slender sedge native to high-altitude environments. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Due to its specialized habitat, it is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous regions."
