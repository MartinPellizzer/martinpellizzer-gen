    "intro": "Cynanchum fernandezii, commonly known as the Argentine milkweed, is a perennial herb native to South America. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in umbels, which are followed by follicles containing toxic, milky sap. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically used in traditional medicine or horticulture."
