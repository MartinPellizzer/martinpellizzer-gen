    "intro": "Cheilanthes griffithiana, commonly known as the Griffith's rockcap, is a species of fern native to the arid regions of South Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of leathery, dark green leaves. The plant is adapted to grow on rocky outcrops and is often found in dry, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Cheilanthes griffithiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-maintenance conditions."
