    "intro": "Croton longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved croton, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, multicolored leaves that range from green to red, orange, and yellow. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its striking foliage rather than its flowers. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Croton longifolius is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal."
