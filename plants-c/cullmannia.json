    "intro": "Cullmannia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed cattail, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance and dense, cylindrical inflorescences. The plants typically grow in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. They have narrow, linear leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers. Cullmannia species are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
