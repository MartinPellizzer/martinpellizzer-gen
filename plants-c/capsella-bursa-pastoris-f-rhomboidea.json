    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris f. rhomboidea, commonly known as the rhomboid weed, is a variant of the common chickweed. It is a low-growing annual herb with prostrate or ascending stems that often lie close to the ground. The leaves are typically rhombic or ovate, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Its small white flowers appear in clusters and are followed by distinctive triangular seed pods. This form is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
