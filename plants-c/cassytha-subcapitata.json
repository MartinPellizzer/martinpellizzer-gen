    "intro": "Cassytha subcapitata, commonly known as the little grapevine, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems that can twine around other plants or objects. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating. Cassytha subcapitata is known for its rapid growth and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
