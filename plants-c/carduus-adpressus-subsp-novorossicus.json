    "intro": "Carduus adpressus subsp. novorossicus, commonly known as the Russian sow-thistle, is a herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spiny, lobed leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often considered a weed. Its leaves are edible when young but become bitter and less palatable as they mature. The species is adapted to thrive in a variety of soil types and can tolerate moderate drought conditions."
