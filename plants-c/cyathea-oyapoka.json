    "intro": "Cyathea oyapoka, commonly known as the Oyapokas fern, is a species of tree fern native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a robust root system that helps it thrive in the moist, nutrient-rich soils of the rainforest floor. Its fronds can grow up to several meters in length, contributing to the dense canopy of the forest. Cyathea oyapoka plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various rainforest organisms."
