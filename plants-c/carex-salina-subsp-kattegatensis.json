    "intro": "Carex salina subsp. kattegatensis, commonly known as the Kattegat saltmarsh sedge, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions of northern Europe. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, adapted to withstand high salt concentrations. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
