    "intro": "Caltha arctica subsp. caespitosa, commonly known as the Arctic buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It features showy yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact, clump-forming growth habit, with basal leaves that are broadly ovate and hairy. Its leaves are adapted to cold climates, with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. This subspecies is often found in moist, rocky soils and is an important component of tundra vegetation."
