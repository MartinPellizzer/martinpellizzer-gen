    "intro": "Cyrtandra wilhelmensis, commonly known as the Wilhelm's piper, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and streamside areas. It has opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface and produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyrtandra wilhelmensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
