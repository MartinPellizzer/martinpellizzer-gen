    "intro": "Centaurea nigricans, commonly known as blackhead thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark purple to black flower heads, which are surrounded by spiny, leaf-like bracts. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. Its leaves are usually gray-green with a rough texture and are covered in fine hairs. Centaurea nigricans is an annual or biennial species that produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into the distinctive black seed heads."
