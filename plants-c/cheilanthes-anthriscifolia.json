    "intro": "Cheilanthes anthriscifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its robust, evergreen fronds that are often broad and leathery, adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in crevices, where it forms dense colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
