    "intro": "Crataegus paradoxa, commonly known as the paradox rose or the ghost rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems, compound leaves, and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red berries in the fall, which are edible but often considered bitter. Crataegus paradoxa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil."
