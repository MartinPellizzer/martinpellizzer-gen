    "intro": "Cylindropuntia acanthocarpa var. ramosa, commonly known as the ramose prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a cylindrical stem with spiny areoles that bear clusters of white flowers. The plant produces edible, yellow-orange fruits that are often used in local cuisines. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a deep root system that allows it to survive in arid environments. The varietal name \"ramosa\" refers to its branched or bushy growth habit."
