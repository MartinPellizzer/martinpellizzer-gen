    "intro": "Chaerophyllum minimum, commonly known as lesser cow-wheat, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features a basal rosette of leaves that are heart-shaped and hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are characterized by their finely divided, fern-like structure, which contributes to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
