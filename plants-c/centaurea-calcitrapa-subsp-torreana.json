    "intro": "Centaurea calcitrapa subsp. torreana, commonly known as the Torreana knapweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features erect, branched stems with narrow, linear leaves and produces small, purple to pinkish flowers in composite heads. Its flowers are followed by bristly, cone-like seed heads, which are characteristic of the genus Centaurea. The subspecies is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient plant in Mediterranean climates."
