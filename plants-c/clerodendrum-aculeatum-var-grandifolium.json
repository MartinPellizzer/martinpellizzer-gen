It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of showy, red-orange flowers that are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and birds. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for use as a hedge or screen in warm climates. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
