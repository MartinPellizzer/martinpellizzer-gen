    "intro": "Carex flacca var. arrecta, commonly known as the upright flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically upright and stiff, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually green to brown in color, and it blooms in the summer months. It thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds and streams. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
