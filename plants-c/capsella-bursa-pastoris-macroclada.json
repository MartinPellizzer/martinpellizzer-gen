    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris macroclada, commonly known as the greater shepherd's purse, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive triangular seed pods, which resemble a purse, hence its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has alternate, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. The flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in racemes, blooming from late spring to early autumn."
