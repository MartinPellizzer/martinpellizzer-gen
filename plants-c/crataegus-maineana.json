    "intro": "Crataegus maineana, commonly known as Maine hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pinkish flowers in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated margins, and turn yellow or red in the autumn. The species is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in woodland edges."
