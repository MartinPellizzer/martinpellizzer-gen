It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and wet meadows. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in suitable environments. The leaves are usually narrow and have a distinctive sheathing base, contributing to its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
