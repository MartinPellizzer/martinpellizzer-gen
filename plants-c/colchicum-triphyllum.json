    "intro": "Colchicum triphyllum, commonly known as the yellow deathcap, is a toxic plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Colchicaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has three leaves that are typically broad and heart-shaped, and it produces a distinctive red-brown seed capsule. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and is often found in the southeastern region of the U.S. Due to its toxicity, it should never be consumed or handled without proper protection."
