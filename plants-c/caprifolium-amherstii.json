    "intro": "Caprifolium amherstii, commonly known as Amherst's honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features slender, arching stems with opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects. The fruit is a small, red berry that ripens in late summer and is edible for both humans and wildlife."
