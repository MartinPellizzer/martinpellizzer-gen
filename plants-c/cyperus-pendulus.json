    "intro": "Cyperus pendulus, commonly known as the hanging flatsedge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that often hang downward, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets. Cyperus pendulus thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
