    "intro": "Clerodendrum flavum, commonly known as the yellow glorybower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces striking clusters of yellow to orange-red flowers, which are typically borne in terminal panicles. Its ornamental value is largely due to its vibrant floral display and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates. The plant is also noted for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
