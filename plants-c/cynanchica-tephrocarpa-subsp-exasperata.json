    "intro": "Cynanchica tephrocarpa subsp. exasperata, commonly known as the exasperated milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves with a hairy surface. The plant produces showy, blue to violet flowers in racemes during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in xerophytic environments."
