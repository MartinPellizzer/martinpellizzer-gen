    "intro": "Crotalaria torrei, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces distinctive, spiny seed pods that split open when mature. Crotalaria torrei is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It plays a role in ecological systems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insects."
