    "intro": "Carex umbrosa f. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved shadow sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and spike-like inflorescences. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wet or damp soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate shade make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
