It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a distinctive yellow lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its fragrant blooms, which emit a sweet, spicy scent, are particularly noticeable in the evening. Cattleya odoratissima is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and unique aroma."
