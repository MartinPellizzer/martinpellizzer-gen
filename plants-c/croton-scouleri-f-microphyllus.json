    "intro": "Croton scouleri f. microphyllus, commonly known as the miniature croton, is a unique variant of the Croton genus native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length, giving it a delicate and compact appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, which are often overlooked due to their modest size. Its foliage exhibits a range of colors, including shades of green, red, and yellow, depending on light exposure and seasonal changes. This ornamental plant is well-suited for container gardening and can thrive in partial shade to full sun conditions."
