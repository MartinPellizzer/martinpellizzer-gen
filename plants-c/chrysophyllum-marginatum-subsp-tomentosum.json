    "intro": "Chrysophyllum marginatum subsp. tomentosum, commonly known as the tomentose custard apple, is a tropical plant belonging to the Sapotaceae family. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, grayish-white pubescence. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, yellowish-orange fruits with a creamy, custard-like pulp. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production. The subspecies is distinguished by its hairy foliage and slightly different fruit morphology compared to other members of the Chrysophyllum genus."
