    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 godseffianum, commonly known as the Godseff's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves, and it produces a single flower per stem, usually in late spring or early summer. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
