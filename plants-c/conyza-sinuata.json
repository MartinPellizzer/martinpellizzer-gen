    "intro": "Conyza sinuata, commonly known as the slender blueweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. The plant has finely divided, silvery-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer. Conyza sinuata is often considered a weed but has ecological value as a food source for insects and a host plant for certain Lepidoptera species."
