    "intro": "Crumenaria polygaloides var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth crumenaria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, contributing to its drought tolerance. The species is characterized by its smooth, glabrous appearance, which distinguishes it from other varieties within the Crumenaria genus."
