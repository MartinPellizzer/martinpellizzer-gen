    "intro": "Cynanchica pumila, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets that are also hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by cylindrical, pod-like fruits. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions."
