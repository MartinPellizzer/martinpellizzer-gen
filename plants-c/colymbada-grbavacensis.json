    "intro": "Colymbada grbavacensis, commonly known as the Grbavacensis water lily, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Balkan region. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. The plant features broad, floating leaves with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
