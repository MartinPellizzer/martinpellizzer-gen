    "intro": "Commidendrum robustum subsp. gummiferum, commonly known as the gum tree cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding visual interest to its otherwise spiny appearance. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it has a shallow root system adapted to rocky soils. This subspecies is valued for its resilience and unique aesthetic, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
