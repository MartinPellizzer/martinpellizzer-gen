It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hairy glands. The plant produces bell-shaped, pale blue or lavender flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a desirable ornamental plant in arid landscapes."
