    "intro": "Carex ferruginea var. laevis, commonly known as the soft-haired sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are generally smooth and glabrous, with a pale green to reddish hue. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike of small, spikelet-like flowers. This variety is distinguished by its soft, silky texture and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
