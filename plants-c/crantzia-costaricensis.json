    "intro": "Crantzia costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican crantzia, is a flowering plant native to Central America, particularly Costa Rica. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and the flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in a disc-like structure. Crantzia costaricensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small insects."
