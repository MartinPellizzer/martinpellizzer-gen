    "intro": "Carduus tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, woolly, gray-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
