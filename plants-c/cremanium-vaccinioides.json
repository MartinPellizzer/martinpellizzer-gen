    "intro": "Cremanium vaccinioides, commonly known as the dwarf cranberry shrub, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the cool, humid regions of southeastern Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants such as blueberries and heathers. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, and it produces clusters of bright red berries that are edible but tart. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and vibrant fall foliage."
