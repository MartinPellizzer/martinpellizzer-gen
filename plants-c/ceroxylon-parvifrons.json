    "intro": "Ceroxylon parvifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wax palm, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae. It is native to the Andean region of South America, specifically Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and narrow, feather-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by dark blue, fleshy fruits. Ceroxylon parvifrons is often found in humid, montane forests and is adapted to grow in cooler, high-altitude environments."
