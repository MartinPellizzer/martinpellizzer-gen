    "intro": "Crataegus splendens, commonly known as the showy crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range from white to pink and red, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically red or yellow, which ripen in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks. Crataegus splendens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and pollinators."
