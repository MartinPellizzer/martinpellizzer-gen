    "intro": "Cortusa matthioli subsp. sibirica, commonly known as Siberian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, branched stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically blue to purple in color. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its frost-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early summer blooming period and compact growth habit."
