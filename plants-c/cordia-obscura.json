    "intro": "Cordia obscura, commonly known as the dark cordia, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 5 meters and has simple, opposite, elliptic leaves that are often dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries that are an important food source for various birds and mammals. Cordia obscura is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
