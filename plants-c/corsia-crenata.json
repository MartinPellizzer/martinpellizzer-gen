    "intro": "Corsia crenata, commonly known as the roughleaf coralroot, is an epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying instead on its mycorrhizal associations with fungi for nutrient absorption. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a spike, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are adapted to cling to tree bark, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Corsia crenata is a rare and endangered species, requiring specific ecological conditions for survival."
