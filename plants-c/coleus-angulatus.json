    "intro": "Coleus angulatus, commonly known as the zigzag coleus, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage with shades of green, white, and red, which adds visual interest to gardens. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in warm, humid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Coleus angulatus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant leaves and ease of care."
