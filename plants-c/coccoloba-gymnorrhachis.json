    "intro": "Coccoloba gymnorrhachis, commonly known as the redland hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal areas and is well adapted to saline and sandy soils. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in coastal environments. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardiness and visual appeal."
