    "intro": "Cinchona tenuis, commonly known as the slender quina, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that contain elliptical seeds. It is closely related to other cinchona species, which are the source of quinine, a compound used in malaria treatment. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal potential, it is cultivated in some botanical gardens and conservation programs."
