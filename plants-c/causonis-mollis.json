    "intro": "Causonis mollis, commonly known as the soft caustic orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant is known for its low-growing habit and unique floral structure. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Causonis mollis is considered a rare and endangered species."
