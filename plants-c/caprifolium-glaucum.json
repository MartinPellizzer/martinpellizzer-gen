    "intro": "Caprifolium glaucum, commonly known as the blue honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and clusters of small, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are oval-shaped, with a distinctive waxy coating that gives them a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not widely cultivated for consumption. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments."
