    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna var. pendula-rosea, commonly known as the Rosaeflora Hawthorn, is a cultivar of the common hawthorn. It is characterized by its weeping growth habit and pinkish-red flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the autumn, which are edible but often used for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its distinctive floral display and unique form."
