    "intro": "Condalia globosa, commonly known as the globular thistle, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has rough, hairy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers. Condalia globosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
