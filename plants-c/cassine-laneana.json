    "intro": "Cassine laneana, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and have a serrated edge. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its bark is thick, flaky, and often has a reddish-brown appearance, which can be used in traditional medicine. Cassine laneana is often found in moist, lowland areas and is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
