It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its spiny, ball-shaped seed pods that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers are adapted to withstand drought conditions. Cyamopsis psoraloides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for certain wildlife species."
