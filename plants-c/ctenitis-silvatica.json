    "intro": "Ctenitis silvatica, commonly known as the silvan ctenitis, is a rare fern species native to the temperate rainforests of the Pacific Northwest. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are divided into fine, hairpin-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity and well-drained, acidic soil. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Ctenitis silvatica is considered a vulnerable species."
