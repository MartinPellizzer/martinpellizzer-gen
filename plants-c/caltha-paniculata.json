    "intro": "Caltha paniculata, commonly known as the golden ragwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to moist woodlands and stream sides in eastern North America. It produces showy, yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture and a waxy coating. Its root system consists of fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Caltha paniculata is often found in shaded, wet environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
