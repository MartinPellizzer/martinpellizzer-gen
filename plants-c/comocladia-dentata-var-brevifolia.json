    "intro": "Comocladia dentata var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea holly, is a coastal plant native to the western Atlantic region. It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant features narrow, serrated leaves and produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its root system helps stabilize sandy soils, making it ecologically important in coastal ecosystems. It is often used in restoration projects to prevent erosion and support biodiversity."
