    "intro": "Clermontia peleana subsp. peleana, commonly known as the Pelelean cliffbrake, is a rare endemic plant found in the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. It thrives in coastal habitats, often growing on rocky cliffs or slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance."
