    "intro": "Cornopteris mcdonellii, commonly known as the McDonald's cliffbrake, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. Native to the western United States, particularly in rocky, moist habitats, this plant thrives in shaded, woodland environments. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Cornopteris mcdonellii is often found growing on cliffs or rocky outcrops, where it adapts well to nutrient-poor soils."
