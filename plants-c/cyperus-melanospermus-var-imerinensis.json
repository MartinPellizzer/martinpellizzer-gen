It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces dark, oily seeds that are often used in traditional medicine and as a spice in some cuisines. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and along waterways, and is often found in disturbed soils.
