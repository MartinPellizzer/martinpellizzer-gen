    "intro": "Chironia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal sedge, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands and coastal areas of the northern hemisphere. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in saline or brackish environments, often found in marshes and estuaries. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers that are clustered in spikelets. It plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Its adaptability to fluctuating water levels and salinity makes it a key species in coastal ecosystems."
