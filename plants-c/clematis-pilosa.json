    "intro": "Clematis pilosa, commonly known as the hairy clematis, is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white during the summer months. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners. Clematis pilosa is also valued for its ability to climb trellises and provide vertical interest in landscapes."
