    "intro": "Cornopteris tashiroi, commonly known as Tashiro's wood fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Japan. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
