    "intro": "Cyclosorus boholensis, commonly known as the Bohol water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that form a rosette shape. The plant has four leaflets arranged in a whorl, with each leaflet being oval and slightly lobed. It thrives in freshwater habitats and is often found in slow-moving streams and ponds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
