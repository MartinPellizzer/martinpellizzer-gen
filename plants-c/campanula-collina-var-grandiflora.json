It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The leaves are lanceolate and hairy, often with a silvery-blue hue due to dense pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
