    "intro": "Cuphea hirsutissima, commonly known as the woolly cuphea, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and purple, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Cuphea hirsutissima is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
