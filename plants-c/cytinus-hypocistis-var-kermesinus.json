    "intro": "Cytinus hypocistis var. kermesinus, commonly known as the Persian crown vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces distinctive red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant is often found in rocky or arid soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
