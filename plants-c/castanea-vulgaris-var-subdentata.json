    "intro": "Castanea vulgaris var. subdentata, commonly known as the European horse chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and showy, white or pinkish flowers that appear in spring. The tree produces spiny, capsule-like fruits containing one or two chestnuts, which are edible after the hard shell is removed. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. The subspecies subdentata is distinguished by its finely toothed leaf margins, setting it apart from other varieties of the genus Castanea."
