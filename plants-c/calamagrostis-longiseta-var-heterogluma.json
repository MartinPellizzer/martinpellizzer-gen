It features tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 120 cm, with narrow, silver-green leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces panicles of small, fluffy seeds that are wind-dispersed, contributing to its ability to colonize open areas. It thrives in moist to wet soils, making it a common sight in wetlands and along stream banks. Its ornamental value is appreciated in gardens for its graceful appearance and ability to attract wildlife."
