    "intro": "Coffea liberica var. ivorensis, commonly known as the Ivory Coast coffee, is a variant of the Liberica coffee species native to West Africa. It is characterized by its large, oval-shaped leaves and produces large, elongated red berries containing two seeds. The plant thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is less commonly cultivated than Arabica or Robusta varieties but is valued for its unique flavor profile. Due to its lower yield and susceptibility to pests, it remains a niche crop in specific regions."
