    "intro": "Camellia japonica var. anemoniflora-rosea, commonly known as the rosea camellia, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from deep red to pink, with a distinctive anemoniflorous (anemone-like) petal arrangement. The plant produces elliptical, glossy leaves that are dark green and provide a striking contrast to the blooms. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. This variety is valued for its winter blooming habit and its ability to add color to the landscape during the colder months."
