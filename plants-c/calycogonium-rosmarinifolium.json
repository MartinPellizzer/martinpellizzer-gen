    "intro": "Calycogonium rosmarinifolium, commonly known as the rosemary mallow, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves that resemble those of rosemary, though it belongs to a different botanical family. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, adding visual appeal to gardens. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrance and drought tolerance."
