    "intro": "Calyptranthes selleana, commonly known as the Hawaiian mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of Hawaii. Its leaves are simple, elliptical, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment. Calyptranthes selleana is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in tropical regions."
