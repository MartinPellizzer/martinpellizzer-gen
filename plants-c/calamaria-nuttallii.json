    "intro": "Calamaria nuttallii, commonly known as Nuttall's calamaria, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant produces berries that are toxic to humans and livestock, making it important to identify correctly. Calamaria nuttallii thrives in rocky soils and arid environments, often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its botanical features include hairy stems, alternate leaves, and a distinctive fruit structure that aids in seed dispersal."
