It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Carex tatrorum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its alpine environment and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme conditions."
