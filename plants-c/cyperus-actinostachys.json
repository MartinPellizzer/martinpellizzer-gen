    "intro": "Cyperus actinostachys, commonly known as the spiked flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, such as marshes and wetlands. Its slender, triangular stems are often clustered, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters. Cyperus actinostachys is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
