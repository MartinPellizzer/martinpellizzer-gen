    "intro": "Cytisus linifolius var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf broom, is a shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are narrow and linear, though the variety latifolius has broader, more rounded foliage compared to the typical species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and rocky habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
