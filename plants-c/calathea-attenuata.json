    "intro": "Calathea attenuata, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that often feature intricate patterns and a deep, velvety texture. The leaves exhibit nyctinasty, a behavior where they fold shut at night and open in the morning, resembling prayer. This unique movement is triggered by changes in light and temperature. Calathea attenuata thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
