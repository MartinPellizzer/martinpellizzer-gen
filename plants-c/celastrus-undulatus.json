    "intro": "Celastrus undulatus, commonly known as the wavy leaf bindweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, ovate leaves with undulating edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural landscapes."
