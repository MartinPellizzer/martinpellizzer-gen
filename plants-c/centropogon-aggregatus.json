    "intro": "Centropogon aggregatus, commonly known as the clustered centropogon, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, where it forms dense clusters of grass-like foliage. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that produce small, two-lobed flowers. The species is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively."
