    "intro": "Carduus recurvatus, commonly known as the nodding thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of western Asia. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and the flowers are arranged in a single, upright head. The plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
