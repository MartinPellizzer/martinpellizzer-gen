    "intro": "Cyperus dilutus var. macrostachys, commonly known as the broad-stalked flatsedge, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown to yellowish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetland habitats, including marshes and seasonally flooded areas, and is often found in association with other aquatic or semi-aquatic vegetation. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common component of wetland ecosystems."
