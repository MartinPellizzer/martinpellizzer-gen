    "intro": "Carex saxatilis var. rhomalea, commonly known as the rock sedge, is a perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and is often found growing in rocky or gravelly habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it thrive in well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
