    "intro": "Cupressus sempervirens f. horizontalis, commonly known as the creeping Italian cypress, is a unique form of the Italian cypress characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. It features scale-like leaves that are closely pressed together, creating a dense, carpet-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous cones, typical of the Cupressaceae family. It is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its slow growth rate and evergreen nature make it a long-lasting ornamental plant in landscaping."
