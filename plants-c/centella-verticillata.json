    "intro": "Centella verticillata, commonly known as the creeping centella, is a low-growing perennial herb native to tropical regions. It features a mat-forming growth habit with fleshy, rounded leaves arranged in a whorl at the nodes. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread easily and colonize moist, shaded areas. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, where it thrives in humid conditions."
