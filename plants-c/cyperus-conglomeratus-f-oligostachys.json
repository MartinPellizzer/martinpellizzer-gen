    "intro": "Cyperus conglomeratus f. oligostachys, commonly known as the narrow-stalked flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as swamps and seasonally flooded areas. Its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small flowers, which are often arranged in two to three tiers. This form is distinguished by its reduced number of flower clusters compared to the typical form of Cyperus conglomeratus."
