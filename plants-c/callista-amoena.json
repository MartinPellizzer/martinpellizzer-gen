    "intro": "Callista amoena, commonly known as the sweet pitcher plant, is a unique carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky, sweet-smelling nectar to attract insects. The plant's structure is adapted for trapping and digesting prey, with a specialized lid that prevents rainwater from diluting the digestive fluids. Its botanical features include a short, erect stem and dense, dark green foliage. Callista amoena is valued for its ecological role in nutrient-poor environments and its striking, ornamental appearance."
