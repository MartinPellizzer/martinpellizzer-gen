    "intro": "Coryphantha pseudechinus subsp. pseudechinus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved coryphantha, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a succulent cactus characterized by its cylindrical stems and small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on the upper parts of the stems. Its leaves are reduced to tubercles, and it is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements. This subspecies is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for cultivation in xeriscaped gardens."
