    "intro": "Cassytha peninsularis, commonly known as the slender cassytha, is a parasitic flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its twining stems that wrap around host plants for nutrient absorption. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate and scale-like, reducing the plant's need for photosynthesis. Cassytha peninsularis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands."
