    "intro": "Casuarina ramosissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved she-oak, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub with distinctive needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by woody, cylindrical fruits that contain seeds. Casuarina ramosissima is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, often growing in dune environments. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
