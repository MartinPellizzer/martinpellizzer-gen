    "intro": "Cereus subintortus var. flavispinus, commonly known as the yellow spiny cactus, is a succulent plant native to South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in sharp, yellow spines. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in arid environments with well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and desert gardens."
