    "intro": "Convolvulus lanuginosus subsp. sericeus, commonly known as the silky hedge bindweed, is a flowering plant characterized by its soft, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to southern Africa and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is a perennial herb that can spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Its fibrous roots and creeping growth habit make it a persistent weed in certain environments."
