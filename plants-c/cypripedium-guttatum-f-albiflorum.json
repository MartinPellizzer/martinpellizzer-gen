    "intro": "Cypripedium guttatum f. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered yellow lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. This variant of Cypripedium guttatum is distinguished by its pale white or cream-colored flowers, which contrast with the typical yellow of the species. The plant features a single, showy flower that is often adorned with intricate patterns and a pouch-like structure called a resupinate lip. It thrives in cool, humid environments with rich, well-drained soil, often in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
