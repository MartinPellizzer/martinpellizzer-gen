    "intro": "Cyperus smithianus, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically arranged in spikelets, which are a defining feature of the Cyperaceae family. Cyperus smithianus thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical structure makes it well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
