It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and marshes. Its flowers are usually greenish or pale yellow, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Crossoglossa eustachys is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
