    "intro": "Comparettia portillae, commonly known as the Portilla's slipper orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pouch-like flower structure that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow with intricate patterns, and it blooms during the rainy season. Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
