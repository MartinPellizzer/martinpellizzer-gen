    "intro": "Cardiospermum corindum var. angustisectum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf heartseed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive, waxy texture and produces small, pale yellow flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds with hooked appendages, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. This variant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaf segments, distinguishing it from other varieties of Cardiospermum."
