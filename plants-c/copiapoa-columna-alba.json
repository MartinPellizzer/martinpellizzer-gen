    "intro": "Copiapoa columna-alba, commonly known as the white column cactus, is a species native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and white to pale green coloration. The plant features spines that are often white or pale, providing some camouflage against the desert environment. It produces yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Copiapoa columna-alba is adapted to extreme arid conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem for survival."
