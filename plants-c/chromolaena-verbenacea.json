    "intro": "Chromolaena verbenacea, commonly known as stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a perennial shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, aiding in its dispersal. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and abandoned fields, due to its adaptability to various soil types. Its aromatic leaves and stems can emit a strong, unpleasant odor when crushed, which is a notable botanical feature."
