    "intro": "Ceropegia minuta, commonly known as the dwarf string of hearts, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces delicate, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, resembling the shape of a small bell. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and rockeries."
