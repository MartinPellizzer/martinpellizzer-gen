    "intro": "Carpinus gigabracteatus, commonly known as the giant bract maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, giving it a striking appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by distinctive, elongated bracts that resemble leaves, which are a key identifying feature. Its bark is smooth and gray, often developing fissures with age, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
