    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris varia, commonly known as the common chickweed, is an annual flowering plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, hairy stems and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, heart-shaped seeds enclosed in a papery capsule, which is a distinctive feature of the species. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal make it a common weed in many regions."
