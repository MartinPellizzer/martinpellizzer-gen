It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family, which includes other milkweeds known for their milk-like sap. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its fruits are follicles that release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Cynanchum roulinioides is often found in moist woodlands and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial shade."
