    "intro": "Calopyxis eviscerata, commonly known as the naked bladder, is a unique plant species belonging to the family Onagraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated, bladder-like structures that serve as seed pods. These pods are often transparent or translucent, allowing the internal structures to be visible. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is native to parts of North America. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
