    "intro": "Campylospermum dependens var. ankaranae, commonly known as the Ankarana rock fig, is a unique plant endemic to Madagascar. It is a small shrub characterized by its thick, succulent stems and waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the specific microclimates of the Ankarana limestone region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
