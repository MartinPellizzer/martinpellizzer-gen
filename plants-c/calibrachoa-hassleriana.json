It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and tobacco. The plant is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. It produces small, oval berries that contain seeds, and it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in its natural habitat."
