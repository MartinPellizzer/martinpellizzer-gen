    "intro": "Cyperus enodis, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, often forming dense stands. Its slender, triangular stems are usually unbranched, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Cyperus enodis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
