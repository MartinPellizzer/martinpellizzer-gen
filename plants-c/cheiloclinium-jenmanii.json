    "intro": "Cheiloclinium jenmanii, commonly known as the Jenman's climbing fig, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Moraceae, which includes figs and related species. The plant is characterized by its trailing or climbing habit, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in inflorescences, and it produces edible fig-like fruits that are typically consumed by birds and small mammals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within its native range."
