    "intro": "Calamus flavinervis, commonly known as the yellow-veined calamus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae. It is a tall, slender reed-like plant that typically grows in wetland or marshy environments. The plant is characterized by its long, narrow leaves with prominent yellow veins, which give it its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spadices, typical of many palms. Calamus flavinervis is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appearance in wetland gardens."
