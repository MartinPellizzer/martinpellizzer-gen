    "intro": "Calystegia sepium subsp. silvatica, commonly known as the forest bindweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems, often found in woodlands and along forest edges. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its roots are fibrous and can spread extensively. This subspecies is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its vigorous growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
