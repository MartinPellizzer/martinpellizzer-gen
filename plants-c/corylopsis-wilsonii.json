It features bright orange to red pendulous flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has slender, arching stems and simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders. Its ornamental value is largely due to its vibrant, showy flowers and autumn foliage."
