    "intro": "Craterostigma pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf rock cress, is a small, perennial herb native to arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by tiny, capsule-like fruits. It has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. Craterostigma pygmaeum is also noted for its ability to survive extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
