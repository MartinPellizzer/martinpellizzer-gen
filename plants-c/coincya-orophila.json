    "intro": "Coincya orophila, commonly known as the mountain moss or the alpine moss, is a small, low-growing plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pottiaceae, which includes many species of mosses adapted to harsh, dry environments. This plant typically grows on rocky substrates or in crevices, where it thrives in cool, shaded conditions. Its leaves are closely appressed and often have a distinct midrib, which helps in identifying the species. Coincya orophila is known for its resilience to environmental stress, making it a common sight in alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
