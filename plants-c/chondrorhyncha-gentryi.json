    "intro": "Chondrorhyncha gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the late spring and early summer. The plant has a unique growth habit, with a short, thick rhizome and a single, narrow leaf. Its flowers are typically clustered in a loose inflorescence and are pollinated by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered plant."
