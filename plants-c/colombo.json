It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, velvety foliage. The plant produces showy flowers in shades of purple, pink, white, and red, often with contrasting markings. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Colombo is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal."
