    "intro": "Ctenopteris celebica, commonly known as the Celebes water fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Indonesia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in swampy or marshy areas. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help in the absorption of nutrients from the waterlogged soil. Ctenopteris celebica plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
