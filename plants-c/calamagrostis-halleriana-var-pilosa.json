    "intro": "Calamagrostis halleriana var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy calamagrostis, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and fluffy, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for ornamental landscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its unique texture and color, as well as its ability to attract wildlife."
