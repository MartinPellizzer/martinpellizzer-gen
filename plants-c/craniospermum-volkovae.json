    "intro": "Craniospermum volkovae, commonly known as the Cape Verde sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the island of Santiago in the Cape Verde archipelago. It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in sandy, coastal environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Craniospermum volkovae is notable for its unique morphology and is considered a rare and endemic species."
