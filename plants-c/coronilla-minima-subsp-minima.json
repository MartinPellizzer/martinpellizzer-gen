    "intro": "Coronilla minima subsp. minima, commonly known as the lesser crown vetch, is a low-growing perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically forms dense mats of prostrate stems, with small, clustered leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to rocky and arid environments, often found in dry grasslands and along coastal areas. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for improving soil fertility in degraded lands."
