    "intro": "Cardiotheca pubescens, commonly known as the silky tree or silky hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red, often with a contrasting white or yellow throat. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds."
