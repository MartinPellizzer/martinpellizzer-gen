It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its most distinctive characteristic is its clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Circaea ovatifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
