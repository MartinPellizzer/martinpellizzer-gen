It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and conservation studies."
