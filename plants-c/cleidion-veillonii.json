    "intro": "Cleidion veillonii, commonly known as the Veillon's cleidia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The plant is characterized by its woody structure, palmate leaves, and showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cleidion veillonii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
