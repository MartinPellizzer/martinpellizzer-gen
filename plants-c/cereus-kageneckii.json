    "intro": "Cereus kageneckii, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems and its ability to produce large, fragrant flowers at night. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun. Its flowers, which open only during the evening, are usually white or pale pink and emit a sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. Cereus kageneckii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and unique blooming habit."
