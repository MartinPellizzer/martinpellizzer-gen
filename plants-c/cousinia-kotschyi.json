    "intro": "Cousinia kotschyi, commonly known as the Persian mullein, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It produces small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss, and its flowers bloom in late summer or early autumn. Cousinia kotschyi is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
