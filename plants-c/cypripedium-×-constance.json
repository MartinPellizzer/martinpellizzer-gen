    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 constance, commonly known as the Constance lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its showy, pinkish-brown flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single, striking flower per stem. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings."
