    "intro": "Chamaedrys quadratula, commonly known as the square-leaved mountain heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its foliage composed of small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly leathery. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink during the spring and early summer. These flowers are followed by small, round berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Chamaedrys quadratula is often found in rocky or well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments."
