    "intro": "Chroniochilus virescens, commonly known as the green-stemmed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a terrestrial orchid with slender, erect stems that often bear a single or few leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a waxy surface, which helps in water retention. This orchid thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
