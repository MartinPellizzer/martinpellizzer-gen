    "intro": "Cereus lamprospermus subsp. colosseus, commonly known as the Colosseus Cereus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
