    "intro": "Coleus collinus, commonly known as the silver bush or silver leaf plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage that features shades of silver, white, and green. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in spikes at the ends of the stems. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Coleus collinus is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
