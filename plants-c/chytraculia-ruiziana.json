It belongs to the family Chytraculaceae and is characterized by its unique leaf structure and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical rainforests. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a short, herbaceous stem. Due to habitat loss and limited study, little is known about its reproductive habits and ecological role."
