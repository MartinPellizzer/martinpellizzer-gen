The plant typically blooms in spring, producing pink to purple flowers with a distinctive, narrow spur. Caladenia multiplex is often found in heathlands and open forests, growing in well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and threatened species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
