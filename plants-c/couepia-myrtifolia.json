It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often fragrant and resemble those of myrtle.

Couepia myrtifolia is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is valued for its ornamental foliage."
