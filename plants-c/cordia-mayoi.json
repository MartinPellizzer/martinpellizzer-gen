    "intro": "Cordia mayoi, commonly known as the red cordia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and dry forests. The plant produces showy, red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are usually opposite, simple, and have a smooth texture with a slightly waxy surface. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal."
