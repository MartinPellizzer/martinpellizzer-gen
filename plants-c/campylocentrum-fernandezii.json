    "intro": "Campylocentrum fernandezii, commonly known as the Fern\u00e1ndez's campylocentrum, is a rare and delicate fern native to the island of La Palma in the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in rocky crevices or on forest floors. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the undersides of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
