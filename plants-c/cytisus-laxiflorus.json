It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
