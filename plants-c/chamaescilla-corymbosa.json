    "intro": "Chamaescilla corymbosa, commonly known as the coastal daisy or coastal buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer, often in dense clusters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in coastal environments. Chamaescilla corymbosa is well adapted to sandy soils and salt spray, making it a hardy species found in coastal dunes and rocky shores."
