It features small, hairy, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of five-petaled, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded woodland areas. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
