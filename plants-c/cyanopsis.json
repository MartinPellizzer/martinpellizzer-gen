It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to blue. The leaves are typically pinnately divided, giving the plant a delicate, fern-like appearance. Cyanopsis species are often found in moist, sandy soils and are native to regions in Europe, Asia, and North Africa. They are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value due to their attractive foliage and flowers."
