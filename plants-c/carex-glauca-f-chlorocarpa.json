    "intro": "Carex glauca f. chlorocarpa, commonly known as the green-stem sedgeland, is a variant of the blue sedge. It is characterized by its glaucous, bluish-green stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike of small, greenish flowers. The botanical features of this form make it distinct from the typical Carex glauca, with a more pronounced chlorophyll-rich appearance."
