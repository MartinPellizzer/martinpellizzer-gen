It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, white to yellowish composite flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. It is considered a weed in some areas but has ecological significance in supporting pollinators."
