    "intro": "Cephalocereus phaeacanthus, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a cactus species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and vibrant, showy flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a unique symbiotic relationship with a fungal organism called a mycorrhiza, which aids in nutrient absorption. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it produces a fleshy, segmented stem that stores water. The plant is popular in horticulture for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
