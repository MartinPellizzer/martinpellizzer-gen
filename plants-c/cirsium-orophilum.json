It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and large, showy purple or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually lobed and covered in fine hairs, and the plant produces achenes as its seeds. Cirsium orophilum is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
