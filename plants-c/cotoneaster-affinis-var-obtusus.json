    "intro": "Cotoneaster affinis var. obtusus, commonly known as the blunt-leaf cotoneaster, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and have a blunt tip, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Cotoneaster affinis var. obtusus is also known for its relatively low maintenance requirements."
