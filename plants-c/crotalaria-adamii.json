    "intro": "Crotalaria adamii, commonly known as the African Bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and inflated seed pods. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with hairy stems and alternate leaves. Its seeds are enclosed in a saccate (sac-like) pod, which splits open when mature to release the seeds. Crotalaria adamii is also known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment."
