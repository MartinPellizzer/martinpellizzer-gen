    "intro": "Cystopus hydrocephalus, commonly known as the water bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its ability to float on the surface of water, supported by bladder-like structures that store air. The plant exhibits a carnivorous trait, using its specialized leaves to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Its reproductive system involves both self-pollination and cross-pollination, enhancing its adaptability in diverse water environments. Cystopus hydrocephalus thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often found in ponds and marshes."
