    "intro": "Coryanthes speciosa var. sumneriana, commonly known as the Sumner's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its large, pale pink or white flowers with a distinctive, elongated lip that resembles a ghostly face, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom, including high humidity and nutrient-rich substrates. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, primarily beetles, which are attracted to the scent and structure of the blooms. Due to habitat loss and its rarity, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in its native range."
