    "intro": "Cycas orientis, commonly known as the oriental cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Cycas orientis is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and historical significance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
