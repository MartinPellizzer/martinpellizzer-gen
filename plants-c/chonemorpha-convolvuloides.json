It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in both wet and dry conditions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it an invasive species in some areas."
