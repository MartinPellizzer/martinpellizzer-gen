    "intro": "Carex stenophylla var. pachystylis, commonly known as the broad-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are usually wind-pollinated. The variety pachystylis is distinguished by its broader, more robust leaves compared to the typical form of C. stenophylla."
