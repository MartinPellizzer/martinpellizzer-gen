    "intro": "Chloraea austiniae, commonly known as Austin's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the coastal regions of southern Queensland, Australia, where it thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments near the coast. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chloraea austiniae is considered endangered and is protected under Australian conservation laws."
