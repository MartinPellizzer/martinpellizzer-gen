    "intro": "Colchicum albomarginatum, commonly known as the white-margin larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers with distinct white margins, which are typically arranged in dense spikes. The plant produces a bulbous corm, which serves as its primary storage organ and allows it to survive in harsh, alpine conditions. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and often covered in a fine, white coating. Colchicum albomarginatum is adapted to cold climates and blooms in late summer, making it a notable species in its native habitat."
