    "intro": "Cassia strigillosa, commonly known as the silky cassia, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with silky, hairy surfaces, which give it its common name. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants. Its seeds are encased in elongated pods and are sometimes used in spice blends. Cassia strigillosa thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks."
