    "intro": "Castilleja guadalupensis, commonly known as the Guadalupe milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow to orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a slender, branching stem and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in association with other shrubs and grasses. Due to its parasitic nature, it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants."
