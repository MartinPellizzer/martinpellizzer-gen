    "intro": "Cucullaria lutea, commonly known as the yellow bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and wastelands. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a strong, aromatic scent, and the fruit is a dry, two-lobed schizocarp. Cucullaria lutea is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
