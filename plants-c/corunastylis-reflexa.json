It is native to Australia and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and colonize new areas. Corunastylis reflexa is often found in coastal and inland regions, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
