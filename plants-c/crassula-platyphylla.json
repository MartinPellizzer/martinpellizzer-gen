It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Its compact size and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
