    "intro": "Campanula tridentata var. velutina, commonly known as the velvet bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves that give it its specific epithet \"velutina.\" The plant produces bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
