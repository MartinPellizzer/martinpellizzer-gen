It is native to specific regions in southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant features small, clustered leaves and produces delicate, yellowish flowers during the warmer months. It is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and requires minimal water. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
