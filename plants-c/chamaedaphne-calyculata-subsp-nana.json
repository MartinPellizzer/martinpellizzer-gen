It is characterized by its small, dark green, leathery leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, white, four-petaled flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and bogs. This subspecies is notable for its compact growth habit and its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions."
