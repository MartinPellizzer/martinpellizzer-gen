It is characterized by its striking yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardens."
