    "intro": "Cycladenia, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a member of the Poaceae family, though it is often mistaken for a type of sedge. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and wetlands. Cycladenia has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, three-lobed seed capsules. It is a perennial herb that plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
