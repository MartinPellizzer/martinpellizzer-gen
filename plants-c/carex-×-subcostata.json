    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 subcostata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sedgeland sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Carex breviculmis and Carex subcostata, characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and cylindrical spikelets. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for various invertebrates and contributing to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems."
