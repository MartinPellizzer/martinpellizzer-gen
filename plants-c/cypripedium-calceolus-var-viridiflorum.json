    "intro": "Cypripedium calceolus var. viridiflorum, commonly known as the green-flowered lady's slipper, is a rare and protected orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its unique greenish-yellow floral pouch and showy, greenish-white petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It has a long flowering period, usually from late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as endangered in many parts of its range."
