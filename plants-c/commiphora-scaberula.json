    "intro": "Commiphora scaberula, commonly known as the rough bark myrrh, is a small to medium-sized shrub native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and small, opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruits are dry, three-lobed capsules that release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Commiphora scaberula is valued for its aromatic resin, which has been traditionally used in incense and medicinal preparations."
