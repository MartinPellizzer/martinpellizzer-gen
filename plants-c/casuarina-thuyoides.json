It is characterized by its unique, cylindrical cones and feathery, needle-like leaves that are clustered in groups of three. The plant is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, often found in dune environments. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers followed by woody, cone-like structures that contain seeds. Casuarina thuyoides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
