    "intro": "Cereus armatus, commonly known as the crown of thorns, is a cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are covered in sharp, spiny areoles. The plant produces large, white, night-blooming flowers that are fragrant and attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its stems are succulent, storing water to help it survive in arid environments. Cereus armatus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and unique flowering habit."
