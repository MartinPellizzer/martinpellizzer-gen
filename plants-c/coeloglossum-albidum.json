    "intro": "Coeloglossum albidum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pale, ghostly appearance, with long, slender leaves and a single, showy white flower. The plant thrives in wet, shaded environments such as swamps and pine flatwoods, often growing on the trunks of trees. It has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered an endangered species."
