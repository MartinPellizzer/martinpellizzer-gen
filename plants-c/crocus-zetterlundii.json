    "intro": "Crocus zetterlundii, commonly known as the Zetterlund's crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It produces showy, early spring blooms with bright yellow petals and a distinctive, dark purple center. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10-15 centimeters and prefers well-drained, sandy soils. Its flowers are often visited by early pollinators such as bees and hoverflies. The bulbs are relatively small and require a period of cold dormancy to bloom successfully."
