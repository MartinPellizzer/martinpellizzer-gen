    "intro": "Cestrum fasciculare, commonly known as the clustered trumpet flower, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, blooming in late summer to early autumn. These flowers are pollinated primarily by nocturnal insects such as moths and bats. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
