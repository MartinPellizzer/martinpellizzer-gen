    "intro": "Calanthe grata, commonly known as the graceful calanthe, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features broad, strap-like leaves that are often a deep green color, providing a striking contrast to its colorful blooms. Calanthe grata prefers cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
