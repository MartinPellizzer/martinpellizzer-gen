    "intro": "Caralluma umbellata, commonly known as the desert hedgehog cactus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of India and Southeast Asia. It is a low-growing, succulent plant with fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the rainy season, which are typically borne on erect, branched inflorescences. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and its stems are covered in small, white, waxy tubercles that help reduce water loss. Caralluma umbellata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
