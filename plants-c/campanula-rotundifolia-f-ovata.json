It is characterized by its rounded, ovate leaves and bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a compact growth habit with a fibrous root system and produces small, capsule-like fruits. Its foliage and floral structure make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
