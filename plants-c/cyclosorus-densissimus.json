    "intro": "Cyclosorus densissimus, commonly known as the dense spike moss, is a species of clubmoss that belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as strobili, are borne at the tips of the stems and contain the spore-producing organs. Cyclosorus densissimus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
