It is characterized by its striking pink to red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by distinctive, fleshy, purple berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture."
