    "intro": "Cycas rumphii f. undulata, commonly known as the wavy cycas, is a rare and ancient cycad species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its distinctive, wavy leaf margins, which set it apart from other cycad varieties. The plant features a stout, unbranched trunk with a thick, fibrous bark, and its leaves are pinnately compound, arising from the base. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and is of significant botanical and conservation interest."
