It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in a flat, disc-like structure. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous or alpine habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
