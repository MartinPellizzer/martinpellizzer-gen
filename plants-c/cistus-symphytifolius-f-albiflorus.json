    "intro": "Cistus symphytifolius f. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered rock rose, is a subspecies of the rockrose genus native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for Mediterranean climates. Its leaves are leathery and aromatic, often used in traditional herbal remedies. The subspecies is distinguished by its pale, almost white flowers, setting it apart from other Cistus varieties."
