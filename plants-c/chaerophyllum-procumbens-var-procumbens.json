    "intro": "Chaerophyllum procumbens var. procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate hogweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features a sprawling habit with multiple stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a rough, hairy texture that distinguishes it from other similar species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
