It is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and is noted for its cold hardiness. The foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that appear after the flowers."
