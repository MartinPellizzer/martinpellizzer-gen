    "intro": "Cyathea tomentosa, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a dense, hairy layer of dead fronds, which gives it its common name. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Cyathea tomentosa is an evergreen plant that thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its unique appearance and slow growth make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and conservation efforts."
