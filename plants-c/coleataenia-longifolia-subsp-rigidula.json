    "intro": "Coleataenia longifolia subsp. rigidula, commonly known as the rigid leaf corymbia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and rigid, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense corymbs, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climates."
