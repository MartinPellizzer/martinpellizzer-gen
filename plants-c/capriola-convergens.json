    "intro": "Capriola convergens, commonly known as the golden saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Capriola convergens is also valued for its resilience to cold temperatures and poor soil conditions."
