    "intro": "Coryphopteris gymnopoda, commonly known as the naked-stemmed fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a unique ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, providing structural support and aiding in nutrient absorption. The fronds are typically bright green and have a smooth, waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental value."
