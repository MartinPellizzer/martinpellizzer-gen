It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its succulent stems and leaves. This variant is distinguished by its unique growth habit and habitat preferences compared to other Cyperus species."
