    "intro": "Casuarina orophila, commonly known as the mountain casuarina, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like leaves that are clustered in groups of three, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Casuarina orophila typically grows in coastal and semi-arid regions, often on sandy soils. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
