    "intro": "Cousinia pterocaulos, commonly known as the woolly globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Cousinia pterocaulos is often found in mountainous areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
