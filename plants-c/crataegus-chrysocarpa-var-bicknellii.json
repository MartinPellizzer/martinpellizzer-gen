    "intro": "Crataegus chrysocarpa var. bicknellii, commonly known as the Bicknell's golden hawthorn, is a rare and specialized variant of the golden hawthorn. It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-orange fruits, which are typically small and berry-like. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is found in specific regions of the eastern United States. It has small, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pinkish flowers in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
