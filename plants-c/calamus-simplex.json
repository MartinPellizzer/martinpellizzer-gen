    "intro": "Calamus simplex, commonly known as slender calamus, is a member of the Acoraceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spadices, which are leaf-like bracts. Calamus simplex is often found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic compounds."
