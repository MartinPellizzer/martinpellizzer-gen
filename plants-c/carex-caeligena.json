    "intro": "Carex caeligena, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. The plant has grass-like leaves that are usually narrow and cylindrical, with a distinct central vein. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, three-stamened flowers, which are often hidden among the foliage. Carex caeligena plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
