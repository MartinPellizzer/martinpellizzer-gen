    "intro": "Crataegus subspinosa, commonly known as the thorned hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white to pink flowers in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and have serrated edges, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Crataegus subspinosa is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed areas, thriving in a variety of soil types."
