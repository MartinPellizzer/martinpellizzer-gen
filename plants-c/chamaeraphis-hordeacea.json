It is a low-growing perennial grass that typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with minute flowers. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and is often found in disturbed or arid environments. Chamaeraphis hordeacea is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant."
