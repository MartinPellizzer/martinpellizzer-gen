    "intro": "Coronilla grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its trifoliate leaves are deeply lobed, and the plant has a climbing habit with hairy stems. Coronilla grandiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
