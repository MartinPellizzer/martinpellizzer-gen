    "intro": "Cyclosorus gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's water clover, is a rare aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, overlapping leaves that form a dense, carpet-like structure on the water's surface. The plant has small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats with muddy substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
