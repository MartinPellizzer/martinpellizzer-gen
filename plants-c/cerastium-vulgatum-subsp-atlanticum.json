    "intro": "Cerastium vulgatum subsp. atlanticum, commonly known as Atlantic mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of the northeastern United States. It features prostrate stems that are covered with dense, soft, grayish-white hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are rounded and hairy, forming a dense mat that helps stabilize sand dunes and coastal soils. It is well adapted to maritime climates and is often found in salt marshes and sandy shores."
