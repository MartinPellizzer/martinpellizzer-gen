    "intro": "Convolvulus aculeatus var. bona-nox, commonly known as the nightshade morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and distinctive, trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the early morning. The plant produces small, round, green berries that turn red when mature, containing seeds for propagation. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in temperate climates."
