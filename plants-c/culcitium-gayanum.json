    "intro": "Culcitium gayanum, commonly known as the Sri Lankan orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the wet zone of Sri Lanka. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under the canopy of rainforests. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces white or pale yellow blooms during the rainy season. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of significant botanical interest for its unique morphology and ecological role."
