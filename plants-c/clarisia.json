    "intro": "Clarisia, commonly known as the bluebell vine, is a tropical flowering plant belonging to the Apocynaceae family. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant produces a milky sap that can be toxic if ingested, containing cardiac glycosides. Clarisia thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blooms. It typically grows along fences, walls, or in hanging baskets, making it a popular choice for vertical gardening."
