    "intro": "Carya pallida, commonly known as the white hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the walnut family (Juglandaceae) and is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green male catkins and female flowers, which develop into hard-shelled nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. Its wood is strong and durable, making it valuable for furniture and tool-making, while its ecological role supports various wildlife species."
