    "intro": "Callitriche obtusangula subvar. cophocarpa, commonly known as the broad-angled water starwort, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are often rounded or ovate, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in dense inflorescences, and are usually white or pale pink. This subspecies is characterized by its robust growth and adaptability to various water conditions."
