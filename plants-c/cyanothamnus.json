    "intro": "Cyanothamnus, commonly known as the blue bush or blue daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their compact, shrub-like growth habit. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, silvery or blue-gray pubescence, giving the plant its common name. Cyanothamnus species produce showy, often blue or violet flowers that bloom in dense clusters. They are adapted to dry, well-drained soils and are often found in coastal and inland regions of Australia."
