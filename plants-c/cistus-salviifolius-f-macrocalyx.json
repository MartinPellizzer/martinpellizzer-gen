    "intro": "Cistus salviifolius f. macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-flowered rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for coastal and arid environments. Its flowers are typically larger than those of the typical species, hence the subspecific name *macrocalyx*. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
