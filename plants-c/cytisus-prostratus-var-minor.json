    "intro": "Cytisus prostratus var. minor, commonly known as the creeping yellow broom, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils."
