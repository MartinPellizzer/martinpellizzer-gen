    "intro": "Cerastium aleuticum, commonly known as the Aleut chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its small, white flowers and hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in cold, harsh environments. This species thrives in rocky, sandy, or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems. Cerastium aleuticum is also sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens due to its delicate appearance."
