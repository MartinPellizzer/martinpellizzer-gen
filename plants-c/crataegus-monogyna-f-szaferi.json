    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna f. szaferi, commonly known as the Szafer's hawthorn, is a compact, ornamental shrub native to Central Europe. It is a naturally occurring form of the common hawthorn, characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and abundant white flowers in early spring. The leaves are typically dark green and glossy, providing visual interest throughout the growing season. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value, especially in small gardens, due to its compact size and showy blooms. It produces small, red berries in the fall, which are edible but often used for ornamental purposes rather than consumption."
