    "intro": "Chorilaena quercifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf cholla, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and modified stems that function as spines, providing protection from herbivores. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are often reduced to a point, typical of many cacti and related species. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in clusters and appearing in late spring or early summer. Chorilaena quercifolia is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water, storing moisture in its thick, fleshy stems."
