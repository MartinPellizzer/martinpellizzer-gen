    "intro": "Copernicia campestris, commonly known as the Brazilian palm or palmeira-de-campos, is a species of flowering plant in the Arecaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is often found in open grasslands and savannas. The plant is characterized by its slender, unbranched stem and pinnately compound leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, coconut-like fruits. Copernicia campestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
