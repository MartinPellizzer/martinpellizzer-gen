    "intro": "Cereus bridgesii, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to South America. It is a tall, columnar cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring a smooth, green stem covered in white spines. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white and pink, and emit a sweet fragrance. These flowers are ephemeral, lasting only a single night before wilting. Cereus bridgesii is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stem and exhibiting succulent characteristics."
