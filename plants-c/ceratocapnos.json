    "intro": "Ceratocapnos, commonly known as the goat's beard, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. It consists of only two species, both native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. The plants are characterized by their distinctive, branched inflorescences that resemble a beard, hence the common name. They typically grow in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. The flowers are small and white or pale yellow, and the plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
