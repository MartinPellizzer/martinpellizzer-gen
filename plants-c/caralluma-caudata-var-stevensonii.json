    "intro": "Caralluma caudata var. stevensonii, commonly known as the Stevenson's horned cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its branching stems covered in small, spine-like tubercles, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
