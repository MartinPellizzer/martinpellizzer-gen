It features small, oval leaves that turn a striking purplish-red color in the autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types. Cotoneaster atropurpureus is also valued for its ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun conditions."
