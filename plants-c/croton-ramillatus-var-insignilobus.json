    "intro": "Croton ramillatus var. insignilobus, commonly known as the variegated croton, is a striking ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, multicolored leaves that display shades of green, yellow, and red, often with contrasting patterns. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny capsules containing seeds. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its aesthetic appeal, it is widely cultivated as a houseplant and in tropical gardens."
