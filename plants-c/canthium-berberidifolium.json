    "intro": "Canthium berberidifolium, commonly known as the yellow spiderberry, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are deeply lobed and resemble the leaves of the barberry plant. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. The berries are edible but should be consumed in moderation due to their mild toxicity."
