    "intro": "Cheilanthes hastata var. canonica, commonly known as the Canonica stonecrop, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it typically grows on rocky outcrops and in arid environments. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth form with thick, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its rhizomes are short and often covered in a dense mat of rhizome scales. This variety is distinguished by its slightly broader and more robust leaves compared to the typical form of Cheilanthes hastata."
