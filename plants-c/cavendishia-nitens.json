    "intro": "Cavendishia nitens, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that have a silvery or pale green hue. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a contrasting lip. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cavendishia nitens is often cultivated for its ornamental value in both indoor and outdoor gardens."
