    "intro": "Cyperus nudiculmis, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family Cyperaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flower heads. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. It has a slender, upright stem with few branches and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often surrounded by bracts. Cyperus nudiculmis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
