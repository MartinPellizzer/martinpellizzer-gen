    "intro": "Crocus hybernus, commonly known as the Welsh crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to western Europe. It typically blooms in early spring, producing delicate, cup-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a corm, and its flowers are often borne on short, sturdy stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. The Welsh crocus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
