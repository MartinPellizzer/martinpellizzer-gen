    "intro": "Chamaecyparis ericoides, commonly known as the creeping cedar or mountain cedar, is a small evergreen conifer native to the western United States. It has a compact, rounded growth habit with scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that develop into blue-black berries. Its foliage is fragrant and has a resinous scent, which is characteristic of the cypress family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
