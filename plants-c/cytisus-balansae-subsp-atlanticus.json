    "intro": "Cytisus balansae subsp. atlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic broom, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes."
