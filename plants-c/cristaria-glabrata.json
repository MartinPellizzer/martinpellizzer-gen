    "intro": "Cristaria glabrata, commonly known as the smooth marsh h\u517b\u6210, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clusters with slender, cylindrical stems. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Due to its preference for wet environments, it is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds."
