    "intro": "Carex stolonifera subsp. alpina, commonly known as Alpine sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and subalpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in cooler climates. It is often found in mountain meadows and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its habitat."
