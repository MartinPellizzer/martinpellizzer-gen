    "intro": "Cistus \u00d7 dansereaui f. maculatus, commonly known as the spotted rock rose, is a hybrid shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features dense, evergreen foliage with glandular, aromatic leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. Its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky or marginal environments make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and garden design."
