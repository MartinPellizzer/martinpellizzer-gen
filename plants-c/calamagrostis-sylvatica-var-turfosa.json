    "intro": "Calamagrostis sylvatica var. turfosa, commonly known as the silky bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and slender, arching stems that form dense, ornamental clumps. This variety is valued for its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils and its tolerance to partial shade. Its delicate appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping and turf areas. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that add subtle visual interest in the late spring and summer."
