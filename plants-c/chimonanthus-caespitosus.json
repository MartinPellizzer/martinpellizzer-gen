    "intro": "Chimonanthus caespitosus, commonly known as the fragrant winter jasmine, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its bright yellow blooms. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its aromatic flowers and attractive foliage."
