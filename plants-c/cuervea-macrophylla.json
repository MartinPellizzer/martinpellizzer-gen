    "intro": "Cuervea macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, which float on the surface of still waters. The plant's flowers are showy, with bright yellow petals and a distinctive green center, blooming in the early morning and closing by midday. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to support its extensive growth. Cuervea macrophylla plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water quality through oxygen production."
