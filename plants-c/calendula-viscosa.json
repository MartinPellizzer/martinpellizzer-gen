    "intro": "Calendula viscosa, commonly known as sticky weed or common sandmat, is an annual flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and serrated leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread easily in disturbed soils. Calendula viscosa is often considered a weed but has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
