    "intro": "Cryptantha muricata var. jonesii, commonly known as the Jones' thornweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually blue to purple in color, blooming in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is characterized by its distinctive, spiny bracts that surround the flower clusters, providing protection and aiding in seed dispersal."
