    "intro": "Carex idahoa, commonly known as Idaho sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its grass-like leaves are usually dark green and have a triangular cross-section, typical of many sedges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical structures."
