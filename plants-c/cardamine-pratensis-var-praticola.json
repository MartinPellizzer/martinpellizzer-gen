    "intro": "Cardamine pratensis var. praticola, commonly known as the meadow buttercup, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges, thriving in partial to full shade. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive heart-shaped base and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a raceme. Its flowers are hermaphroditic, meaning they have both male and female reproductive structures. The species is known for its delicate appearance and is often found in nutrient-rich soils."
