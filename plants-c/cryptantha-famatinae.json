    "intro": "Cryptantha famatinae, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family, characterized by its hairy stems and showy blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its survival in harsh environments. Cryptantha famatinae plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
