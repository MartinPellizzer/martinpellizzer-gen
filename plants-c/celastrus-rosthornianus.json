    "intro": "Celastrus rosthornianus, commonly known as the African starfruit vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features opposite, simple, and often elliptical leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by spherical, fleshy fruits that resemble starfruits in appearance. The fruit is edible, with a sweet and tangy flavor, and is often consumed fresh or used in local cuisines. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for hedges and ornamental gardening in suitable climates."
