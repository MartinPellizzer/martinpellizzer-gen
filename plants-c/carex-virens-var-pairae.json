    "intro": "Carex virens var. pairae, commonly known as the silver-spike sedge, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with silver or pale green. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in areas with partial to full shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it an effective plant for erosion control. Carex virens var. pairae is valued in ecological restoration projects and as a low-maintenance ornamental in water garden settings."
