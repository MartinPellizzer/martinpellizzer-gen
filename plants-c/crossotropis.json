    "intro": "Crossotropis, commonly known as the silky ironwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, often clustered flowers. The leaves are typically compound, with a silvery or grayish underside that gives the plant its common name. Crossotropis species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. They are often found in dry, rocky habitats and are known for their hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils."
