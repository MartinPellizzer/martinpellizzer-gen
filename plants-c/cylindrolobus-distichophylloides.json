    "intro": "Cylindrolobus distichophylloides, commonly known as the two-leafed clubmoss, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Lepidoziaceae. It is characterized by its diminutive, cylindrical stems and two-ranked, linear leaves that give it its specific epithet. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure known as a strobilus, which contains the sporangia for spore production. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
