    "intro": "Cardamine resedifolia var. morii, commonly known as the Morii watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant has slender, creeping stems that produce small, kidney-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. Its flowers are white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, spherical fruits. This variety is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to other members of the Brassicaceae family."
