    "intro": "Cerastium arcticum var. procerum, commonly known as the Arctic mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Arctic and alpine regions. It features small, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to withstand harsh cold and strong winds. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Its compact form and frost-resistant characteristics make it a hardy species suited to extreme environmental conditions."
