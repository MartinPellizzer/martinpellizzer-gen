    "intro": "Crataegus \u00d7 macrocarpa subsp. calciphila, commonly known as the limestone hawthorn, is a subspecies of the hawthorn plant adapted to calcareous soils. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks in regions with limestone-rich soil. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
