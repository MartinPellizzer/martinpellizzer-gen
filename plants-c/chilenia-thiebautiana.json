It is a shrub characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often in rocky soils and moist microhabitats. It is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
