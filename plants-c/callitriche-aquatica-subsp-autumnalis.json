    "intro": "Callitriche aquatica subsp. autumnalis, commonly known as water starwort, is a semi-aquatic flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and marshes. The plant has slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes, and its small, star-shaped flowers are usually white or pale pink. It blooms from late summer to early autumn, producing tiny, floating fruits that disperse via water. This subspecies is adapted to wetland habitats and plays a role in aquatic ecosystem stability."
