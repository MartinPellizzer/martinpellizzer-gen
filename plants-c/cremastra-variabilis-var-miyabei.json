    "intro": "Cremastra variabilis var. miyabei, commonly known as the Miyabe's bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland areas and stream sides. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a hairy texture, while the stems are slender and branching. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
