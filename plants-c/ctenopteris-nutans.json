    "intro": "Ctenopteris nutans, commonly known as the hanging fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, drooping fronds that give it a cascading appearance. The plant has pinnate leaves with a soft, feathery texture, and its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. Ctenopteris nutans thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of cultivation."
