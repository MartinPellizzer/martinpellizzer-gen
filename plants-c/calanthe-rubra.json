    "intro": "Calanthe rubra, commonly known as the red calanthe, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red and green foliage and produces showy, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive red lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. Calanthe rubra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
