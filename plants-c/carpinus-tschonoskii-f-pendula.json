    "intro": "Carpinus tschonoskii f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping hornbeam, is a unique cultivar of the hornbeam tree characterized by its cascading branches that droop gracefully from the main stem. This form exhibits a distinct growth pattern, with elongated, pendulous shoots that create a soft, flowing appearance. Botanically, it retains the typical features of the species, including its oval, glossy leaves and smooth, gray bark. It is a deciduous plant, shedding its leaves in autumn, and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it adaptable to a range of growing conditions."
