    "intro": "Cactus glabratus, commonly known as the naked cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its spineless, cylindrical stems that are covered in a thick layer of wax to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its adaptations to extreme desert conditions include deep root systems and the ability to store water in its fleshy stems. Despite its lack of spines, it is still a formidable and resilient plant in its native habitat."
