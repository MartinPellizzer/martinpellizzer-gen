    "intro": "Cerastium decalvans f. bogdanovicii, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically forms dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in harsh, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, windy conditions. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems."
