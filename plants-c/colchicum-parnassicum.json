    "intro": "Colchicum parnassicum, commonly known as the Parnassian colchic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It produces striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive spurred shape, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has a short, stout stem that supports its single, showy flower. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette that helps conserve moisture in its rocky habitat. Colchicum parnassicum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often found in meadows and mountainous areas."
