    "intro": "Castilleja collina, commonly known as the Sierra Indian Paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red, brush-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its host plants for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Castilleja collina plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
