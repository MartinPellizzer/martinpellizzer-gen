    "intro": "Cuervea amplissima, commonly known as the giant cuervea, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Cuervea amplissima is well adapted to its harsh environment, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
