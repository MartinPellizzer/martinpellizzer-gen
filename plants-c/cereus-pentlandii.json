    "intro": "Cereus pentlandii, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and ability to store water in its thick, fleshy tissues. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its blooming cycle is unique, with flowers lasting only a few hours before wilting. Cereus pentlandii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its striking, ephemeral blooms."
