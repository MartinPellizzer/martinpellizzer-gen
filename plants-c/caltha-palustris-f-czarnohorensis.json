    "intro": "Caltha palustris f. czarnohorensis, commonly known as the Black Mountain marsh marigold, is a rare and distinctive variant of the marsh marigold. It is characterized by its dark green foliage and striking yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. This subspecies is native to the Carpathian region and thrives in moist, acidic soils. It is often found in wet meadows and along the edges of streams. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable plant species."
