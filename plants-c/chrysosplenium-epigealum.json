    "intro": "Chrysosplenium epigealum, commonly known as the creeping chrysosplenium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, woolly coating. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale yellow, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats over time."
