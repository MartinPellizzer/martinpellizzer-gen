    "intro": "Cryptostylis filiformis, commonly known as the slender false spider-orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in subtropical and tropical rainforests. It has a short, narrow stem and lacks pseudobulbs, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus Cryptostylis. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
