    "intro": "Carex subspathacea var. planifolia, commonly known as the flat-leaved sedge, is a perennial plant native to the temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with broad, flat leaves that are typically light green in color. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to brown flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
