    "intro": "Crepinia delectabilis, commonly known as the sweet-scented fern, is a herbaceous plant native to the humid tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and emit a subtle, pleasant aroma. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures are small, clustered spore-bearing cones that develop at the base of the fronds. Due to its ornamental value and unique fragrance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
