    "intro": "Casuarina suberosa, commonly known as the silky gum, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like leaves that are arranged in clusters, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in dune environments. Casuarina suberosa is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable for soil enrichment."
