    "intro": "Cannabis foetens, commonly known as the stinking hemp or foetid hemp, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers and its distinctive, unpleasant odor. The plant contains varying levels of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), though generally lower than other Cannabis species. Its leaves are typically narrow and elongated, with a rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or coastal environments."
