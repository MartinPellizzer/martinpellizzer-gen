    "intro": "Carludovica wallisii, commonly known as the Mexican devil's backbone, is a striking cactus native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant features clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a unique, branching structure that resembles a backbone. Carludovica wallisii is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water."
