It is characterized by its striking violet to red flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows as an erect herb with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of botanical circles."
