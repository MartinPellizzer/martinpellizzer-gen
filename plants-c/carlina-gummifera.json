    "intro": "Carlina gummifera, commonly known as the gumweed or stickyweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that often emit a sticky, resinous substance. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its latex-like sap has been used historically for various purposes, including as a natural adhesive. Carlina gummifera thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides."
