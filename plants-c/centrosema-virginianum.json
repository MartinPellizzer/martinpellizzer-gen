    "intro": "Centrosema virginianum, commonly known as the Virginia needlegrass. It is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae, characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. Native to the eastern United States, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps prevent soil erosion. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, enriching the soil and supporting other plant growth."
