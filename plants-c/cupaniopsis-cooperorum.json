It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and smooth, greyish bark. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is often found in sandy soils. It produces small, fleshy fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
