    "intro": "Cardamine gmelinii, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a small perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky soils and forest floors. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and colonize rocky habitats effectively. Cardamine gmelinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local insect populations."
