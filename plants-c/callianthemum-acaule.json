    "intro": "Callianthemum acaule, commonly known as the naked-stem rockcress, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and features a rosette of basal leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, hairy pedicels. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
