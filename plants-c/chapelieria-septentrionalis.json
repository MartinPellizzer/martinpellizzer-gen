    "intro": "Chapelieria septentrionalis, commonly known as the Northern Chapelier's orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the temperate regions of northern Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest floors, preferring rich, humus-filled soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its inflorescence consists of a single, upright spike bearing several pale pink to white flowers. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Chapelieria septentrionalis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
