    "intro": "Centaurea spinosociliata subsp. cristata, commonly known as the crested thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and striking purple to pink flower heads that resemble small thistle blooms. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets, with the central disk being particularly prominent. The subspecies cristata is distinguished by its distinctive, crested appearance on the flower head, which gives it its common name."
