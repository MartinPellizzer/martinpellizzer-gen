    "intro": "Casearia dolichophylla, commonly known as the long-leaf casearia, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
