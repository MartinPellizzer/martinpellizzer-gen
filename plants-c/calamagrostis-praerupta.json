    "intro": "Calamagrostis praerupta, commonly known as the purple moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant features tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are usually pale green to brown in color. Calamagrostis praerupta plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
