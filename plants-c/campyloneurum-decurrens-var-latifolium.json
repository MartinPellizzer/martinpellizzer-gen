    "intro": "Campyloneurum decurrens var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf mossy fern, is a variant of the broadleaf fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a lush green appearance throughout the year."
