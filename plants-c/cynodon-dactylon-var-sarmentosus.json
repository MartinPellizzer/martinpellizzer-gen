    "intro": "Cynodon dactylon var. sarmentosus, commonly known as African carpet grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread rapidly and form dense mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, pastures, and disturbed areas. Its adaptability and aggressive growth make it both a useful forage crop and a potential weed."
