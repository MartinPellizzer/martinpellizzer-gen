    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 orphanum, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and exotic plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, showy, slipper-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in areas with rich organic soil. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with a unique pouch-like structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
