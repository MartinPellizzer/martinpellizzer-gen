    "intro": "Carya ovata, commonly known as the pecan, is a deciduous tree native to the southern United States. It belongs to the walnut family (Juglandaceae) and is characterized by its compound leaves and edible nuts. The tree produces oblong, spiny husks that encase the edible kernels. Its bark is thick, ridged, and often fissured, providing a distinctive appearance. The pecan is valued for its economic importance in agriculture and its ecological role in supporting wildlife."
