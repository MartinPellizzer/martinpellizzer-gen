It is characterized by its vibrant yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are oppositely arranged along the stem. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Crossandra flavicaulis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
