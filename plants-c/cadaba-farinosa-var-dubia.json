    "intro": "Cadaba farinosa var. dubia, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, and its hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture. The plant is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a hardy species for xerophytic environments. It typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas or near dunes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscaping."
