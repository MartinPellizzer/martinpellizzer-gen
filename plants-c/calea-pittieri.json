    "intro": "Calea pittieri, commonly known as the \"Mexican nightshade,\" is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface, adapted to reduce water loss in its native arid environment. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshade plants like tomatoes and peppers. Calea pittieri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
