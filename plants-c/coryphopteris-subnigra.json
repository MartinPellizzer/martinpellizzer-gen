    "intro": "Coryphopteris subnigra, commonly known as the black fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often tinged with black or brown at the base. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself in rocky substrates. The spore-bearing structures, or sorus, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
