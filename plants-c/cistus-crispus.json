    "intro": "Cistus crispus, commonly known as the rough rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy leaves and showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is well adapted to rocky and dry environments, often growing on limestone soils. Its aromatic foliage and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it a hardy and resilient species. Cistus crispus is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
