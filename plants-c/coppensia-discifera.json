    "intro": "Coppensia discifera, commonly known as the disc-shaped liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has a leafy structure with closely arranged leaves that form a dense, cushion-like appearance. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophytes, are often embedded within the leaf rosettes. Coppensia discifera is a cryptogamic plant that plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
