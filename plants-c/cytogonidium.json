It is characterized by its complex cellular structure, including a unique nucleus with a high number of chromosomes. The cytogonidium plays a significant role in marine ecosystems as a primary producer and a contributor to bioluminescence. It is also known for its ability to form harmful algal blooms under certain environmental conditions. Its life cycle involves both asexual and sexual reproduction, which contributes to its ecological and biological diversity."
