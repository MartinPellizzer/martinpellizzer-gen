    "intro": "Carex auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate sedge, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers that are clustered in spikelets, which are borne on tall, slender stems. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. Carex auriculata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
