    "intro": "Cycas circinalis subsp. seemannii, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like structure with thick, leathery leaves that are typically a deep green in color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in moist, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
