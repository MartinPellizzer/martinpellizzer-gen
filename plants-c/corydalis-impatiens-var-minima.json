It features delicate, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy, and it grows to a height of only a few inches, making it a compact and ornamental species. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. This variant is smaller than the typical Corydalis impatiens, with a more compact growth habit."
