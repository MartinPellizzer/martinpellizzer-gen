    "intro": "Calea scoparia, commonly known as the \"flower of the night,\" is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent flowers that glow in the dark, a unique adaptation that aids in attracting pollinators. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and often branching. Calea scoparia is valued not only for its aesthetic appeal but also for its traditional use in herbal medicine."
