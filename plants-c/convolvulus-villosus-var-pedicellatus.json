    "intro": "Convolvulus villosus var. pedicellatus, commonly known as the hairy bindweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pale purple or white in color. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and along roadsides. This species is often considered a weed due to its aggressive spreading habit and ability to persist in various environmental conditions."
