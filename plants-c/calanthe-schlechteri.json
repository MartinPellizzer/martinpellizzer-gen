The plant typically produces pale pink or white petals with a yellow lip, and its leaves are broad and elliptical. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
