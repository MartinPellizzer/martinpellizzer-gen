    "intro": "Coronilla heterophylla, commonly known as the variable crownvetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves that can be either trifoliate or pinnate depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in erosion control due to its extensive root system. Coronilla heterophylla is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
