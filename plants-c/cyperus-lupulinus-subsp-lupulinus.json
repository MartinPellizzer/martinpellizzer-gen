    "intro": "Cyperus lupulinus subsp. lupulinus, commonly known as the white rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wet or marshy habitats, often forming dense colonies in shallow water or moist soil. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it both a common wetland plant and a potential invasive species in some areas."
