    "intro": "Coespeletia elongata, commonly known as the elongated cholla, is a species of cactus native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in clusters of spines, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny structure. Its adaptations to high-altitude environments include reduced leaf surfaces and efficient water storage in its stem. Coespeletia elongata plays a role in its ecosystem by providing shelter and food for various desert animals."
