    "intro": "Critoniopsis pallida, commonly known as the pale critoniopsis, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, silky hair, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
