It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that often feature intricate patterns in shades of green, silver, and pink. The plant is known for its unique leaf movement, where the leaves fold upwards at night and unfold in the morning, resembling a praying gesture. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal. Calathea venusta thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent humidity and well-draining soil to flourish."
