    "intro": "Cotoneaster obtusus, commonly known as the blunt-leaf cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a blunt or rounded tip. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. Cotoneaster obtusus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types. It is often used in landscaping for its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes."
