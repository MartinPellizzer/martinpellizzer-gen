    "intro": "Croton comosus, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a striking tropical plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are typically bright green with a waxy texture. The plant produces showy, orange-red inflorescences that resemble flames, which bloom in clusters during the dry season. Its rapid growth rate and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types make it a popular ornamental plant. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact."
