    "intro": "Ceropegia foliosa, commonly known as the \"String of Hearts,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features trailing stems with heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green or pink, which are pollinated by specific moths. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its attractive foliage and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
