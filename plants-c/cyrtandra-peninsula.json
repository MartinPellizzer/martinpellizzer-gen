    "intro": "Cyrtandra peninsula, commonly known as the Hawaiian Cyrtandra, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family, native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often with contrasting markings. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and is often found in high elevation areas. Due to habitat loss, several species within this group are considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
