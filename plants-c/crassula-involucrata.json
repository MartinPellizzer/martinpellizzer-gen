    "intro": "Crassula involucrata, commonly known as the rock rose or snowball plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid environments."
