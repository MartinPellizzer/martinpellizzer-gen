    "intro": "Chamaecyparis obtusa f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf Japanese cedar, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen conifer with a rounded, bushy form. It features scale-like leaves that are a dark green on top and silvery white underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and small landscapes. Its ornamental value lies in its dense foliage and ability to maintain a compact shape with minimal pruning."
