    "intro": "Chaetospora brevisetis, commonly known as the short-setose chaetospora, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Caloplacaceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, tightly adherent layer on rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale yellow to orange in color, with a granular texture. It contains the photosynthetic partner Trebouxia, which provides the algal component necessary for its survival. This lichen is often found in temperate regions, growing on calcareous substrates."
