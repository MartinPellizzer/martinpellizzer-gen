It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
