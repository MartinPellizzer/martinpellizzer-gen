    "intro": "Campanula pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf bellflower, is a small perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of only a few inches, featuring compact rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces delicate blue or violet bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Campanula pusilla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
