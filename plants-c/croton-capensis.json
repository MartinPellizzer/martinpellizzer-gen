    "intro": "Croton capensis, commonly known as the Natal croton, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and rocky outcrops. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
