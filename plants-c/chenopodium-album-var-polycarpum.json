    "intro": "Chenopodium album var. polycarpum, commonly known as lamb's quarters, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its alternate, broadly ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, followed by edible, triangular seeds that are rich in nutrients. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields, gardens, and along roadsides. Due to its nutritional value, it is sometimes cultivated as a leaf vegetable or used in traditional medicine."
