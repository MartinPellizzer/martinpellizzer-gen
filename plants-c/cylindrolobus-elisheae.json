It is characterized by its unique, cylindrical flower clusters that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along its stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in conservation programs."
