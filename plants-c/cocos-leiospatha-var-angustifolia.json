    "intro": "Cocos leiospatha var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf coconut palm, is a variant of the coconut palm native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are narrower than those of the typical coconut palm. The plant produces coconuts, though its fruit is often smaller and less commercially valuable than that of other coconut varieties. Its botanical features include a tall, slender trunk and a dense crown of feathery leaves. This variant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique foliage and adaptability to coastal environments."
