    "intro": "Coronilla, commonly known as sweet clover, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. These plants are often found in dry, rocky soils and are adapted to thrive in temperate climates. Coronilla species are valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making them useful in agriculture and ecological restoration. They also have historical uses in herbal medicine and as a forage crop for livestock."
