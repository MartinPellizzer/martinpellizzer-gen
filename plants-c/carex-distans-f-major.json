    "intro": "Carex distans f. major, commonly known as the giant marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. This subspecies is notable for its robust growth and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
