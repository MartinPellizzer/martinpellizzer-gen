    "intro": "Convolvulus sepium var. maritimus, commonly known as the sea convolvulus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of salt marshes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
