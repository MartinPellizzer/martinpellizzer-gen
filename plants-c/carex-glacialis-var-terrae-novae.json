    "intro": "Carex glacialis var. terrae-novae, commonly known as the Newfoundland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of Newfoundland. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is typically found in coastal heath and dune environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, arranged in dense spikes, and is pollinated by wind. This variety is notable for its resilience to salt spray and cold climates, making it an important component of the region's coastal flora."
