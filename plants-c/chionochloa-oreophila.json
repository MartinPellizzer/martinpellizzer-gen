    "intro": "Chionochloa oreophila, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its fine, silky foliage and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its flowering stems are slender and bear small, spike-like inflorescences. Chionochloa oreophila plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
