    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 favillianum, commonly known as the favillian lily, is a hybrid orchid species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically feature a distinctive yellow or green lip and a striking purple or red upper lip. The plant has a pseudobulbous structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, adapting to its cool, moist forest habitats. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
