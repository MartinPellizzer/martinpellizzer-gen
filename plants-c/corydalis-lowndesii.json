    "intro": "Corydalis lowndesii, commonly known as the lowndes' corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Fumariaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, nodding flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It features slender, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
