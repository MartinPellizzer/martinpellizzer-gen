    "intro": "Calanthe kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu calanthe, is a rare and endemic orchid found exclusively in the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves and intricate, fragrant floral structure. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, typically growing on rocky substrates or among moss-covered trees. Its flowers, which bloom in late winter to early spring, are usually pale green to white with a distinct central lip. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, Calanthe kinabaluensis is considered a conservation priority."
