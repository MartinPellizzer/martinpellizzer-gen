    "intro": "Corytholoma leopoldii, commonly known as the Leopold's coralroot, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the high-elevation forests of the western United States. It is a mycoheterotroph, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrition. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in a raceme, giving it a coral-like appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing in association with specific tree species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
