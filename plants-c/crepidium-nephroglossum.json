It is characterized by its unique, kidney-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and velvety in texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and relatively rare species within the orchid family."
