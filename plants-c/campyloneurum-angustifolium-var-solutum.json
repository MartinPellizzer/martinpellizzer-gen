    "intro": "Campyloneurum angustifolium var. solutum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed campyloneurum, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for studying fern morphology and ecological adaptation."
