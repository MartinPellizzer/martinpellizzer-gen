    "intro": "Cassia rupicola, commonly known as the rock cassia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and leathery, dark green leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Cassia rupicola thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or arid landscapes. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
