    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis lineata var. fargesii, commonly known as the Farges' talaud, is a species of evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts, and is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, cup-shaped fruits that contain one or two seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in subtropical forests at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
