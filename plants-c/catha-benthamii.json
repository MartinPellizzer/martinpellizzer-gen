    "intro": "Catha benthamii, commonly known as the African khat, is a flowering plant native to eastern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds, though it is not closely related to these plants. The plant is characterized by its trailing stems, heart-shaped leaves, and small, yellowish-green flowers. Its fruit is a small, round, greenish-yellow berry that matures in late summer. The plant is notable for containing cathinone and cathine, stimulant alkaloids that contribute to its traditional use in social and cultural practices."
