    "intro": "Cuscuta calliopes, commonly known as the golden dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on a variety of plants, including grasses and shrubs. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and sometimes through human activity. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause damage to agricultural crops and native vegetation."
