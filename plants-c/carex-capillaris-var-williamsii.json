    "intro": "Carex capillaris var. williamsii, commonly known as the Williams' sedge, is a variant of the slender sedge native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its grass-like foliage and dense, cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. The leaves are generally narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and the flowers are usually pale green to brownish in color."
