    "intro": "Corydalis lidenii, commonly known as the Liden's fumitory, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in cooler climates. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its natural propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
