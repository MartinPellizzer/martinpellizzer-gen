    "intro": "Chassalia ugandensis, commonly known as the Uganda chassalia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of East Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and is known for its showy, yellow-orange inflorescences. It has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
