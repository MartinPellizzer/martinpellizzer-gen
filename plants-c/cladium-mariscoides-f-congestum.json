It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is often found in marshes and shallow water areas. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny flowers. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its wetland habitat, making it a valuable component of wetland ecosystems."
