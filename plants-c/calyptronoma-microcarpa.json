    "intro": "Calyptronoma microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern Australia. It typically grows in dense, compact clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are clustered along the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or seasonally flooded areas. Calyptronoma microcarpa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
