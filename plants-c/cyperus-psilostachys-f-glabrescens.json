    "intro": "Cyperus psilostachys f. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth flatsedge, is a grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves that are usually smooth to the touch. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters, typical of the sedge family. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is distinguished by its reduced pubescence, giving it a smoother appearance compared to other forms of Cyperus psilostachys."
