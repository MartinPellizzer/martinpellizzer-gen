    "intro": "Cereus gracilis, commonly known as the slender candle cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a spiny, columnar cactus that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters. Its stems are covered in small, white spines, and it produces showy, night-blooming flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It is a popular choice for desert gardens due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
