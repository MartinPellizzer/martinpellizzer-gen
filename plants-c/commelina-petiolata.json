The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers with three petals and three sepals, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Commelina petiolata is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed."
