    "intro": "Carex munda, commonly known as common sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its triangular, grass-like stems and typically produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
