    "intro": "Citrus ventricosa, commonly known as the sour orange, is a small evergreen tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thorny branches, dark green, oval-shaped leaves, and fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The fruit is typically small, round, and has a thick, yellowish rind with a high concentration of essential oils. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in citrus cultivation. However, it is not commonly used for commercial fruit production due to its bitter taste."
