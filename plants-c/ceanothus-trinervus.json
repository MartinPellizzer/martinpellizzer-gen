    "intro": "Ceanothus trinervus, commonly known as the coast ceanothus, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the coastal climate with its drought-resistant characteristics. The plant features small, clustered blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and often have a silvery or grayish underside, which helps reflect sunlight. Ceanothus trinervus plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various wildlife species."
