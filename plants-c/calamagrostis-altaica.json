    "intro": "Calamagrostis altaica, commonly known as the Altai reed, is a perennial grass native to central Asia. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks, preferring moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-based flowers. Calamagrostis altaica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
