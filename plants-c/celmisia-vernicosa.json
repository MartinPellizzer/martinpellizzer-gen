It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and delicate, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas of forests and is often found in the South Island. Its leaves are covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Celmisia vernicosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
