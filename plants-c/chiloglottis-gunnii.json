    "intro": "Chiloglottis gunnii, commonly known as the pink fairy tern, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its unique, urn-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to white, often with a contrasting greenish or purple hue. The plant typically grows in coastal heathlands and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. It has a short, erect stem with a single, showy flower that blooms during the cooler months. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is classified as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
