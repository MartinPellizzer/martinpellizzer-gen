    "intro": "Caucaea chimborazoensis, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, particularly in Ecuador. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. It has small, lanceolate leaves and produces showy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
