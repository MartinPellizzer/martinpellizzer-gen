    "intro": "Cucumis trigonus, commonly known as the horned cucumber, is a unique species belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive horn-like protrusions on the fruit, which are more pronounced in mature specimens. The plant typically grows as an annual vine, with trailing stems and palmately lobed leaves. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. The fruit is edible, though its bitter taste and spiny texture make it less commonly consumed compared to other cucumber varieties."
