    "intro": "Clutia polifolia, commonly known as the hairy clutia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits. Clutia polifolia is often found in moist, shaded areas and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
