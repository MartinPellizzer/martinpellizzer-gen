    "intro": "Cirsium leucostylum, commonly known as the white-hairy thistle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and a tall, branched inflorescence that bears purple to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to temperate climates. Its fuzzy, white undersides on the leaves give it a distinctive appearance, and it is often found in alpine meadows. The species is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage and blooms."
