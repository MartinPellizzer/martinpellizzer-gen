    "intro": "Coffea bukobensis, commonly known as Bukoban coffee, is a rare and endemic species native to Tanzania. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped red berries that contain two seeds, which are used to produce coffee beans. The plant thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is typically found in mountainous regions, where it grows at elevations between 1,500 and 2,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Coffea bukobensis is considered a vulnerable species."
