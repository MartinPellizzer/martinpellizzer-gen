    "intro": "Coilotapalus, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a species native to South America, particularly in regions of Argentina and Chile. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters in height, with a broad, spreading canopy. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a distinctive silvery-white underside, giving the plant its common name. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish-white in color, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions."
