    "intro": "Calystegia marginata, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous vine that grows along the shoreline, often in sandy or saline soils. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale purple to white in color. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a distinctive wavy margin, which gives it its scientific name. Calystegia marginata is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it a characteristic species of maritime ecosystems."
