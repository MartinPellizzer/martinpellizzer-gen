    "intro": "Castilleja dendridion, commonly known as the tree-like Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a long, slender stem that resembles a tree, hence its common name, and it often grows in association with other plants, drawing nutrients from their roots. Its leaves are narrow and alternate, and it produces small, scale-like leaves along its stem. Castilleja dendridion is known for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its unique parasitic relationship with host plants."
