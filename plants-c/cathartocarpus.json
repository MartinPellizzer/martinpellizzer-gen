It consists of several species native to various regions of the Americas, particularly in temperate and subtropical climates. The plants are characterized by their dense, tufted growth habit and bright yellow inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Cathartocarpus species typically thrive in well-drained soils and are often found in open woodlands or along streambanks. Their ornamental value makes them popular in horticulture for their visual appeal and hardiness."
