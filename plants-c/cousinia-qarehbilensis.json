    "intro": "Cousinia qarehbilensis, commonly known as the Qarehbil cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It thrives in rocky or gravelly habitats and is often found in mountainous areas. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
