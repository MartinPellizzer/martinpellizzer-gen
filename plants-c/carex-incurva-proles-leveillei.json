It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, cylindrical flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands or along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
