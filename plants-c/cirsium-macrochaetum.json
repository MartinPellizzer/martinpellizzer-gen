    "intro": "Cirsium macrochaetum, commonly known as the large-hairy thistle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves with coarse teeth and a dense covering of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or grassy slopes. Cirsium macrochaetum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
