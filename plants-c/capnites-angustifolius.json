It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically clustered in whorls along the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
