    "intro": "Curculigo pilosa, commonly known as the hairy arrowhead, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, which includes orchids, and is characterized by its unique, arrowhead-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist, shaded environments. Curculigo pilosa is often found in swampy areas and is adapted to thrive in high humidity and nutrient-rich soils."
