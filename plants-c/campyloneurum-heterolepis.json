    "intro": "Campyloneurum heterolepis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping growth habit and small, ovate leaves that are often curved at the tips. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature. Campyloneurum heterolepis is well adapted to humid conditions and plays a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat."
