It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, often with a reddish or purplish tint. The plant produces showy, spathaceous flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which are borne on tall, sturdy stalks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes.
