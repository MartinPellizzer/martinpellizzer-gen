    "intro": "Cactus formosus, commonly known as the beautiful cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Central America. It is characterized by its spiny, columnar stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss through transpiration. Cactus formosus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and resilience."
