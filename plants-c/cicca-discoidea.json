    "intro": "Cicca discoidea, commonly known as the disc-shaped cicca, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its distinctive, flattened, disc-like structure. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America and is often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant features a short, thick rhizome with dense, fibrous roots, and its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The flowers are small and clustered in umbels, producing a delicate, yellowish-green color. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Cicca discoidea is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
