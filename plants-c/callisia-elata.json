    "intro": "Callisia elata, commonly known as the silver sword or silver spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a succulent perennial that typically grows in rocky or dry habitats. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy, silver-gray coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white, often blooming in the summer months. Callisia elata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
