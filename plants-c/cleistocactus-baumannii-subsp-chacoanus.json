    "intro": "Cleistocactus baumannii subsp. chacoanus, commonly known as the Chacoan cactus, is a species native to northern Argentina and southern Bolivia. It is a small, columnar cactus with a ribbed stem and typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, a characteristic feature of its nocturnal flowering habit. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly more elongated shape and a broader distribution compared to other members of the Cleistocactus genus."
