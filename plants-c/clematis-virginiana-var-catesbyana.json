    "intro": "Clematis virginiana var. catesbyana, commonly known as the Catesby's virgin's bower, is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Its climbing habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a hardy, flowering vine."
