    "intro": "Cydonia oblonga subsp. maliformis, commonly known as the rough-hairy quince, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thick, rough bark and fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a distinctive, pear-shaped fruit with a thick, leathery skin that turns yellow or orange when ripe. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, while the plant is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in Mediterranean climates."
