It is characterized by its distinctive bladder-like structures, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and is native to Madagascar. Its leaves are submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface. Crucianella bou-arfae plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
