    "intro": "Cardamine strictula, commonly known as narrowleaf watercress, is a small, herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and rocky crevices. The plant has alternate, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in a single umbel, and it produces distinctive, elongated seed pods. Cardamine strictula is valued for its peppery flavor and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
