    "intro": "Carex subumbellata var. verecunda, commonly known as the slender bulblet sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale to greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Its rhizomes and bulbils allow for vegetative propagation, contributing to its ability to spread and colonize new areas. This variety is often found in association with other wetland plants, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
