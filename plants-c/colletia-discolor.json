    "intro": "Colletia discolor, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration in desert ecosystems."
