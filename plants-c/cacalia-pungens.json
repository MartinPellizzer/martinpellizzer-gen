    "intro": "Cacalia pungens, commonly known as the prickly morning glory, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, prickly stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and bloom in the morning. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in open fields or along roadsides. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
