    "intro": "Callisia insignis, commonly known as the silver spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb with a sprawling growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant features bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, accompanied by silver-white leaves that give it its common name. Its stems are covered in fine, hair-like structures, and it is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Callisia insignis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
