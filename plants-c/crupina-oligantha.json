    "intro": "Crupina oligantha, commonly known as the coastal crupina, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Crupina oligantha is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species in coastal environments."
