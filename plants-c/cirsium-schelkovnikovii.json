    "intro": "Cirsium schelkovnikovii, commonly known as Schelkovnikov's thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and large, rough, hairy leaves. The plant produces purple to pinkish flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets, typical of the Compositae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
