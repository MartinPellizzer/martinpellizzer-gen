It is characterized by its upright, herbaceous growth habit and distinctive, often triangular leaves. The plant produces small, greenish or reddish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Cryptonema species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. They play a role in soil stabilization and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
