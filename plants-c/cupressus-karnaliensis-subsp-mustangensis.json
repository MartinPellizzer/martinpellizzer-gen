    "intro": "Cupressus karnaliensis subsp. mustangensis, commonly known as Mustang cypress, is a rare and endemic coniferous species native to the Himalayas, specifically found in Nepal and northern India. It is characterized by its narrow, pyramidal shape and dense, dark green foliage. The plant exhibits dimorphic leaves, with juvenile leaves being needle-like and adult leaves scale-like. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky soils and steep slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for ecological and botanical studies."
