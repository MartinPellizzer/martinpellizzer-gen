    "intro": "Callichilia subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved callichilia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed-like species. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Callichilia subsessilis is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in semi-arid conditions."
