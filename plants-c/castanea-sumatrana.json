    "intro": "Castanea sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and other chestnut species. The tree produces edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, similar to other chestnut species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland and hill forest ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
