    "intro": "Cacalia diffusa, commonly known as the common bluebell, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and delicate, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It produces small, spherical fruits called schizocarps, which disperse seeds via the wind. Cacalia diffusa is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
