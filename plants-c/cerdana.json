    "intro": "Cerdana, commonly known as the white stork's bill, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Cerdana is often found in moist soils along stream banks and in wet meadows."
