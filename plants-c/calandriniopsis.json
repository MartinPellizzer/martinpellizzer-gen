    "intro": "Calandriniopsis, commonly known as the small clover, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of small, herbaceous plants that typically grow in temperate regions. The leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and the flowers are small and clustered in heads. These plants are often found in grassy areas and are known for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. They play a minor role in ecological systems but are sometimes considered weeds in agricultural settings."
