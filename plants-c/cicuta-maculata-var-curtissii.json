    "intro": "Cicuta maculata var. curtissii, commonly known as the Curtiss water hemlock, is a toxic member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in umbrella-shaped clusters. The plant contains potent toxic compounds, primarily cicutoxin, which can be lethal to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and wetlands. Due to its high toxicity, it is often considered a noxious weed in agricultural and natural areas."
