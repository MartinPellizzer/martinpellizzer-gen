    "intro": "Carex capillaris f. saskatschewana, commonly known as the Saskatchewan sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. It produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers in the summer, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. This variety is distinguished by its slightly broader leaves and more robust growth compared to the typical Carex capillaris."
