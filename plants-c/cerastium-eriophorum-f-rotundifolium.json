It is characterized by its rosette of rounded, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders."
