    "intro": "Colobanthus, commonly known as Antarctic hair grass, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. These plants are typically low-growing and herbaceous, with small, often hairy leaves. They are native to cold and arid regions, including Antarctica, the Arctic, and high-altitude environments. Colobanthus species are adapted to survive in extreme conditions, exhibiting features such as compact growth and reduced water loss. Their flowers are usually small and clustered, often with five petals, and they play a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
