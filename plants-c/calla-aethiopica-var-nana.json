    "intro": "Calla aethiopica var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf calla lily, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to South Africa. It features striking, arrow-shaped leaves and elegant, white spathes that enclose small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of only 10-15 cm, making it ideal for container gardening or as a foreground plant in water gardens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, preferring cool to temperate climates. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate foliage and the dramatic contrast between its white blooms and dark green leaves."
