    "intro": "Cedrela poblensis, commonly known as Mexican cedar, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The tree typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters, with a straight trunk and a broad, spreading crown. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and lanceolate, while its flowers are small and clustered in catkins. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds."
