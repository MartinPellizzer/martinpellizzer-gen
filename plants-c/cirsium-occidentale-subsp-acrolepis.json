    "intro": "Cirsium occidentale subsp. acrolepis, commonly known as the western thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The subspecies is distinguished by its more robust growth and slightly different leaf morphology compared to other Cirsium species."
