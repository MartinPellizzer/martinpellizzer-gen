    "intro": "Cotula stolonifera, commonly known as the trailing cotula or dwarf dandelion, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features small, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a spreading growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered in fine hairs. Cotula stolonifera is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
