    "intro": "Cyathea indusiosa, commonly known as the Indusian tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its slow growth and longevity. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, which helps in attracting pollinators at night. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
