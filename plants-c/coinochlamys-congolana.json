It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and small trees. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
