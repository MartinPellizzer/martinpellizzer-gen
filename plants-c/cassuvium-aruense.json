    "intro": "Cassuvium aruense, commonly known as the Aru Island starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the remote Aru Islands in Indonesia. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its star-shaped, violet-blue petals. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the rainforest understory. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Due to habitat destruction, Cassuvium aruense is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
