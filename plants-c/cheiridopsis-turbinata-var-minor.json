    "intro": "Cheiridopsis turbinata var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf ice plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a hardy, low-maintenance garden plant."
