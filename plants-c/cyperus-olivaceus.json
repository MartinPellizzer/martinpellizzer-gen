    "intro": "Cyperus olivaceus, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, triangular leaves. The plant produces spikes of tiny, pale green to brown flowers, typically arranged in clusters. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond edges, and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Cyperus olivaceus is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions, with rhizomes that help it spread and establish in moist soils."
