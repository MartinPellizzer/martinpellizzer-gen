It is characterized by its striking, lobed leaves that often display a vibrant mix of green, red, and yellow hues. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
