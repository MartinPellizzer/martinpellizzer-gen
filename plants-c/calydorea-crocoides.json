    "intro": "Calydorea crocoides, commonly known as the golden crocus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, yellow-orange inflorescence that resembles a cluster of small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. Its blooming period occurs in the spring, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
