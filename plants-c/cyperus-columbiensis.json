    "intro": "Cyperus columbiensis, commonly known as the Columbia flatsedge, is a perennial herb native to the southern United States. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and prairies, and thrives in moist to saturated soils. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually wind-pollinated, and it plays a role in maintaining wetland ecosystems. Cyperus columbiensis is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the biodiversity of these environments."
