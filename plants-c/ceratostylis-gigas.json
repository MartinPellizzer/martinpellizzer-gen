    "intro": "Ceratostylis gigas, commonly known as the giant horned orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence that consists of numerous white to pale yellow flowers with prominent, horn-like staminodes. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients in its native habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
