    "intro": "Chamaeraphis effusa, commonly known as the slender glassworts, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, salt-tolerant leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or muddy habitats, often in intertidal zones where it withstands salt spray and tidal inundation. Its small, green flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse seeds by wind. Chamaeraphis effusa plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
