    "intro": "Cereus aureus, commonly known as the golden candle cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, pale green stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom at night, a feature typical of many nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. Cereus aureus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soil with minimal water."
