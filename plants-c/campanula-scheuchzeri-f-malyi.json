    "intro": "Campanula scheuchzeri f. malyi, commonly known as the Malyi bellflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often branched and sturdy. This species is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to its harsh environment."
