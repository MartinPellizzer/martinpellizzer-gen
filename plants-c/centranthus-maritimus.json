    "intro": "Centranthus maritimus, commonly known as sea centranthus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and western Europe. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular, pink or red flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong winds. Centranthus maritimus is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
