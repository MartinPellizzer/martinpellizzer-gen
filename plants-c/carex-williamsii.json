It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and stream banks. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually wind-pollinated. Carex williamsii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
