    "intro": "Campomanesia salviifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or yellow mombin, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to orange-red, fleshy fruits resembling small apples. These fruits are edible, with a sweet and tangy flavor, and are often consumed fresh or used in local cuisines. The tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its fruit and shade."
