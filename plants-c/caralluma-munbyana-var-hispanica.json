    "intro": "Caralluma munbyana var. hispanica, commonly known as Spanish torch cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It features a branching structure with cylindrical stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
