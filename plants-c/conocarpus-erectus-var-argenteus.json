    "intro": "Conocarpus erectus var. argenteus, commonly known as silver buttonwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found in mangrove ecosystems due to its tolerance of saline and waterlogged soils. The silver buttonwood is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing shorelines."
