    "intro": "Carex depressa var. euxina, commonly known as the Bulgarian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Europe. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, riverbanks, and damp meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense clumps, and it produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies in suitable environments. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
