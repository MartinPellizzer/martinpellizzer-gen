    "intro": "Cousinia podophylla, commonly known as the narrowleaf cottonthistle, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, often hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cousinia podophylla produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
