    "intro": "Cyperus proteinolepis var. pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf flatsedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
