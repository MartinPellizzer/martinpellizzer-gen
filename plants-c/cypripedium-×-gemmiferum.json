    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 gemmiferum, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive pouch-like lip, which is a defining feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in cool, moist forest environments, often in shaded areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its flowers, which can be pink, white, or yellow, are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
