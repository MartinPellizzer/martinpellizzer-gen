    "intro": "Colubrina obscura, commonly known as the dark colubrina, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in coastal areas. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or white, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture, while its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Colubrina obscura is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
