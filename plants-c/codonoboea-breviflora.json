    "intro": "Codonoboea breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered codonopsis, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, often arranged in whorls along the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly seen in its natural habitat."
