    "intro": "Changium angustilobum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed changium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its native range."
