It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Chenopodium ambrosioides and Chenopodium berlandieri. The plant has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a rough, sandpapery texture. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and for understanding plant hybridization."
