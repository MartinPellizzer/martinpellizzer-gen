    "intro": "Chamaesyce occidentalis, commonly known as western sandmat, is a low-growing annual herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically forms a dense mat of slender, succulent stems and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its structure and growth habits make it a common weed in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gardens."
