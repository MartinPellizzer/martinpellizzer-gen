The plant typically grows at elevations between 500 and 1,500 meters, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are strap-like and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Coelogyne abbreviata is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
