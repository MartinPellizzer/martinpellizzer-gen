    "intro": "Cotyledon haussknechtii, commonly known as the orange cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a yellow or orange hue, especially under direct sunlight. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and requiring minimal irrigation. Cotyledon haussknechtii is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements."
