    "intro": "Coelogyne carnosa, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vivid pink and white flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns resembling slippers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Coelogyne carnosa is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its beauty and fragrance."
