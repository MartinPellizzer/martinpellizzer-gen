    "intro": "Centaurea lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It produces small, fluffy seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal, aiding in its propagation. Centaurea lanceolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and drought tolerance."
