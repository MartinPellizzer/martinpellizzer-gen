    "intro": "Campylospermum dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's campylospermum, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for native insects and birds."
