    "intro": "Camaridium cyrtopodanthum, commonly known as the silverleaf coralroot, is an epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients, making it a myco-heterotroph. The plant has a slender, branching stem with small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with three sepals and three petals, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Due to its dependence on specific fungi and habitat conditions, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
