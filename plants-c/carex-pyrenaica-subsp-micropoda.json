    "intro": "Carex pyrenaica subsp. micropoda, commonly known as the Pyrenean sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southwestern Europe. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
