    "intro": "Chamaecyparis obtusa var. plumosa-flavescens, commonly known as the Japanese white cedar or golden thread cedar, is a unique variant of the Japanese cedar. It is characterized by its finely dissected, feathery foliage that gives it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. Its foliage is typically a soft yellow-green, which can turn golden in full sun. This variety is well-suited to cooler climates and requires well-drained soil to thrive."
