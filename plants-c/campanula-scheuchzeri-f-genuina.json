    "intro": "Campanula scheuchzeri f. genuina, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a rare and frost-sensitive perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the Alps. It features showy, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
