    "intro": "Cochlearia hederacea, commonly known as the ivy-leaved spring beauty, is a flowering plant native to the British Isles. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with small, cruciform flowers. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of ivy, hence its common name. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers, which are usually pink or white, bloom in early spring and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
