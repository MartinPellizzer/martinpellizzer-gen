    "intro": "Calamagrostis lanceolata var. riparia, commonly known as river reed, is a perennial grass native to wetland habitats in North America. It features tall, slender blades that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with a graceful, arching appearance. The plant produces fluffy, silver-gray seed heads that add ornamental value in the fall. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found along riverbanks and pond edges. Its dense growth helps prevent erosion and provides habitat for various wildlife species."
