    "intro": "Commelina bracteosa subsp. rhizomifera, commonly known as the creeping spiderwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features slender, rhizomatous stems that allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, blue-violet flowers with three petals, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, often with a slightly waxy surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks."
