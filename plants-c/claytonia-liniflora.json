    "intro": "Claytonia liniflora, commonly known as the woolly mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, pale pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine regions. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Claytonia liniflora is a short-lived perennial that thrives in full sun to partial shade."
