    "intro": "Crataegus lasiantha, commonly known as the large-flowered hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are oval with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Crataegus lasiantha is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local fauna."
