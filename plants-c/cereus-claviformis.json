    "intro": "Cereus claviformis, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Canary Islands. It is a low-growing, spiny plant with a short stem and clusters of bright red flowers that bloom at night. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
