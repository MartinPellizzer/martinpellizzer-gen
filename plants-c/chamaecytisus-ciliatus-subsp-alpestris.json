    "intro": "Chamaecytisus ciliatus subsp. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine broom, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in its arid, high-altitude habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
