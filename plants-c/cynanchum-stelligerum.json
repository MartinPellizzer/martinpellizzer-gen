    "intro": "Cynanchum stelligerum, commonly known as the hairy milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes other milkweeds, and is characterized by its milky sap, which can be toxic. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and stream banks, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often hairy, while its flowers are clustered in umbels and range in color from white to pink. Cynanchum stelligerum plays a role in supporting local ecosystems, though it is not commonly cultivated."
