    "intro": "Cynosurus siculus, commonly known as the Sicilian bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Cynosurus siculus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of Mediterranean ecosystems."
