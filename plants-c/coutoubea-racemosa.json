    "intro": "Coutoubea racemosa, commonly known as the pink trumpet bush, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a member of the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to red tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with dark green, leathery leaves. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure. Coutoubea racemosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
