    "intro": "Calamus tetradactylus var. bonianus, commonly known as the Chinese walking stick, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly China, and is characterized by its long, slender rhizomes and narrow, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spadices, a common feature among members of the Araceae family. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
