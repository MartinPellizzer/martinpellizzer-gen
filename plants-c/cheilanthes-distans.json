    "intro": "Cheilanthes distans, commonly known as the remote lip fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. This plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, preferring arid or semi-arid environments. The fronds are usually pale green to grayish in color, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture. It is native to regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico."
