    "intro": "Cedrela serrulata, commonly known as the Brazilian cedar, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and alternate, simple leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, elongated fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland and mountainous rainforests. Cedrela serrulata is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which has been historically used in furniture and construction."
