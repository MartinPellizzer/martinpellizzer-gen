    "intro": "Carex diandra, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, strap-shaped leaves and compact, cylindrical flower spikes. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along streambanks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
