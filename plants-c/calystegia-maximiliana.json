    "intro": "Calystegia maximiliana, commonly known as the giant morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a vigorous vine that can grow up to 10 meters in length, featuring large, showy flowers that open in the morning and close in the afternoon. The plant has heart-shaped, lobed leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
