It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and bright blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across rocky and dry habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and along coastal areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
