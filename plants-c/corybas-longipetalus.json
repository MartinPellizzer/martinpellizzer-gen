    "intro": "Corybas longipetalus, commonly known as the long-petaled helmet orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to Australia. It is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped flower that is often brightly colored, typically in shades of red or orange. The plant produces a single, showy bloom that sits atop a slender stem, which is often covered in a dense, hairy coating. Its flowers are adapted for specific pollination by small insects, particularly flies, due to their strong, unpleasant odor. Corybas longipetalus thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rainforest or swampy areas."
