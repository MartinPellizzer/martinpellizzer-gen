It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is well adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, followed by distinctive, spiny pods that contain seeds. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Chamaecrista burchellii is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant."
