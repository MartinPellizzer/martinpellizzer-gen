It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are usually basal, with a hairy texture that helps protect it from harsh weather. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
