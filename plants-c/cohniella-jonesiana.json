    "intro": "Cohniella jonesiana, commonly known as the Jones' cohniella, is a rare and specialized plant species found in specific alpine environments. It is characterized by its compact growth form and dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted for pollination by wind or specific insect species. Its root system is highly developed, allowing it to anchor firmly in rocky or nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Cohniella jonesiana is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
