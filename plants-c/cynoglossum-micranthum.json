    "intro": "Cynoglossum micranthum, commonly known as narrowleaf heartworts, is a flowering plant belonging to the Boraginaceae family. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are typically arranged in a basal rosette, and the plant produces a short, hairy stem. The flowers are often clustered in racemes and are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitats."
