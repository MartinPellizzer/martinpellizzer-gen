The plant has simple, opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The berries are not only ornamental but also serve as a food source for various wildlife species."
