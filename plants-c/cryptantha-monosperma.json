    "intro": "Cryptantha monosperma, commonly known as the single-seeded cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces a single seed per fruit, which is a distinctive feature contributing to its common name. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Cryptantha monosperma plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
