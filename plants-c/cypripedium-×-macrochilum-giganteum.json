    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 macrochilum giganteum, commonly known as the giant yellow lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow pouch-shaped flower with a distinctive green lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is valued for its ornamental beauty and rarity in cultivation. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in the wild."
