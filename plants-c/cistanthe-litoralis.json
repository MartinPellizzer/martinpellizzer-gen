    "intro": "Cistanthe litoralis, commonly known as the coastal cistanthe, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous annual plant that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid coastal conditions. Cistanthe litoralis plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
