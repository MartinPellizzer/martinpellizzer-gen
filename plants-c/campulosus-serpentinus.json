    "intro": "Campulosus serpentinus, commonly known as the serpentine campulose, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in serpentine soils, which are rich in heavy metals and low in essential nutrients. Its botanical features include a low-growing, mat-forming structure with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It is classified as a member of the Apiaceae family, known for its aromatic compounds and often edible members. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Campulosus serpentinus is considered an indicator species for serpentine ecosystems."
