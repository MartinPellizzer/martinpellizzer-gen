    "intro": "Corydalis caseana subsp. brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-fruited larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. The plant features slender, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are blue to purple in color, with two upper petals that are spurred and two lower petals that are broader. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter, more compact fruiting structures compared to other Corydalis species."
