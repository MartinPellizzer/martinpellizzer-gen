    "intro": "Carex stipata var. uberior, commonly known as the broad-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It features grass-like leaves that are typically broader than those of other sedges, with a dark green color and a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in temperate regions. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
