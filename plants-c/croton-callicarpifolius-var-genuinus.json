It is characterized by its striking, multicolored leaves that feature prominent red veins against a backdrop of green, yellow, or orange. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by orange-red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens with suitable conditions."
