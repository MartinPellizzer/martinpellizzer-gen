    "intro": "Cissus phyllomicron f. eglandulosa, commonly known as the dwarf grape ivy, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically smaller than those of the species, with a smooth texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by small, round berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its trailing habit makes it a popular choice for hanging baskets or as a ground cover in shaded areas."
