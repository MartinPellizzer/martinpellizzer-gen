    "intro": "Cleistocactus parviflorus var. aiquilensis, commonly known as the Aiquilense Blossom Cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the Andes of Peru. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of white to pale blue spines. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the summer months. It thrives in high-altitude environments with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
