    "intro": "Crotalaria rufipila, commonly known as the red-hair vetch, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers with distinctive spurred petals, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated pods that split open when mature, releasing the seeds to the wind. Crotalaria rufipila is often used in traditional medicine and can also serve as a forage plant for livestock."
