    "intro": "Chironia arenaria var. mediocris, commonly known as the beach sandplant, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It is well-suited to sandy soils and is often found in dunes and other coastal habitats. Its ability to stabilize sand dunes makes it ecologically significant in preventing erosion."
