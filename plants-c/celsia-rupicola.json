It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and unique habitat, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
