    "intro": "Carex consanguinea, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex consanguinea typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and it plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil retention and habitat for various aquatic organisms."
