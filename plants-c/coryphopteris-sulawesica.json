    "intro": "Coryphopteris sulawesica, commonly known as the Sulawesi tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in lowland and montane rainforests. Its rhizome system supports the growth of its tall, tree-like structure, while its fronds contribute to the ecological diversity of its habitat. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
