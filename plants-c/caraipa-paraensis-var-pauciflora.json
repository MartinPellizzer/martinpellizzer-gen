    "intro": "Caraipa paraensis var. pauciflora, commonly known as the rare Amazonian orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to the dense canopy of its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
