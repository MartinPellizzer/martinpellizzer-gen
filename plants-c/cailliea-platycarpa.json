    "intro": "Cailliea platycarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruited cailliea, is a flowering plant species native to specific regions in Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, a feature typical of many species in the Rubiaceae family. Cailliea platycarpa is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth."
