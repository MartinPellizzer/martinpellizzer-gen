    "intro": "Cardiospermum corindum var. subglabratum, commonly known as the velvetleaf or heartleaf morning glory, is a tropical vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant features a climbing habit, with stems that twine around supports, and its leaves are typically palmately lobed. The flowers are usually pale blue or purple, with a distinctive, spurred structure at the base. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds covered in a sticky, fleshy aril. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and thrives in warm, humid climates."
