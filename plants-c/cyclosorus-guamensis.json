    "intro": "Cyclosorus guamensis, commonly known as the Guam cyclosorus, is a unique fern native to the island of Guam in the Mariana archipelago. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where humidity is high. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the undersides of its leaves, a common feature among ferns. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, Cyclosorus guamensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
