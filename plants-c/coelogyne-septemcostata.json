    "intro": "Coelogyne septemcostata, commonly known as the seven-costate orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters on a hairy stem. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water and nutrients. This species is prized by orchid growers for its ornamental value and unique floral structure."
