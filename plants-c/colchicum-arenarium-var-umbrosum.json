    "intro": "Colchicum arenarium var. umbrosum, commonly known as the shadow lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking violet to blue flowers that bloom in late summer, often in shaded or rocky habitats. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It is a member of the Colchicaceae family, known for its toxic alkaloids, including colchicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
