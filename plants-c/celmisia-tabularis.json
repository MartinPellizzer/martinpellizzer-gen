    "intro": "Celmisia tabularis, commonly known as the mountain celery or the silver fringed bellflower, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its distinctive silver-tomentose leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in cool, moist environments. It is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, and its growth is limited to high-altitude areas due to its specific ecological requirements. Celmisia tabularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
