    "intro": "Cereus hermentianus, commonly known as the Hermentia cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a tall, columnar cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring a smooth, green stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom at night. These flowers are ephemeral, opening only briefly before closing and withering. Cereus hermentianus is adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water and reduce transpiration."
