    "intro": "Cardamine amara f. stricta, commonly known as the slender water cress, is a variant of the water cress species native to moist, often calcareous environments. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short, lateral stems. Its leaves and stems are edible and have a peppery flavor similar to that of other cress species. This subspecies is often found in stream banks, wet meadows, and other damp habitats across temperate regions."
