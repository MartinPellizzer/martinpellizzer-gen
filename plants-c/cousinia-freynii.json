    "intro": "Cousinia freynii, commonly known as the Freyn's cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss, and it produces small, yellow to brown flowers. Cousinia freynii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
