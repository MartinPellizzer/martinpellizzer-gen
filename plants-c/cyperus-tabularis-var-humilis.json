    "intro": "Cyperus tabularis var. humilis, commonly known as the flat sedgeland sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically brown or purple in color. The plant thrives in moist to aquatic conditions, making it a common sight in swampy areas and along the edges of ponds. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its botanical structure is adapted for waterlogged soils, with rhizomes that help in vegetative propagation."
