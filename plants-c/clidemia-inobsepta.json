    "intro": "Clidemia inobsepta, commonly known as the creeping mallow, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing herbaceous perennial that typically forms dense mats on the forest floor. The plant features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with hairy surfaces and prominent veins. Its showy, five-petaled flowers are usually pink or white, blooming in clusters during the wet season. Clidemia inobsepta plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
