It produces striking violet to purple flowers with a distinctive, sweet fragrance, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Its bulbs are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of saffron-like stigmas.
