    "intro": "Clinostigma, commonly known as the rock cress, is a genus of flowering plants in the mustard family, Brassicaceae. It consists of several species, many of which are perennial herbs native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal rosettes of leaves and produce small, bright yellow flowers in early spring. Clinostigma species are often found growing in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained environments. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their hardy nature and attractive foliage."
