It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Carex gandogeri is valued for its ability to filter water and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
