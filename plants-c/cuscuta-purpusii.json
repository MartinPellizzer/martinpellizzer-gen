    "intro": "Cuscuta purpusii, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow or orange flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to parts of the United States and is often found on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, allowing it to spread to new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or damage its host plants, making it a potential agricultural weed."
