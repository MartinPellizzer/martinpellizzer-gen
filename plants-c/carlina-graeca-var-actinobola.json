    "intro": "Carlina graeca var. actinobola, commonly known as the Greek crownflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features a rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces striking, daisy-like yellow flowers with a central brown disk, blooming from late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
