It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and a tall, branched inflorescence that bears yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
