    "intro": "Calligonum affine, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in the spring. The plant has a compact growth habit with woody stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and inland deserts. Calligonum affine is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize sandy soils in harsh environments."
