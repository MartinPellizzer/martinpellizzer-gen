    "intro": "Cyphorima decumbens, commonly known as the creeping cyphorima, is a low-growing perennial plant native to certain regions of Africa. It features a mat-forming habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture. Cyphorima decumbens is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
