    "intro": "Cercocarpus betuloides var. multiflorus, commonly known as the multi-flowered curlleaf buckthorn, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its distinctive, curling leaves that resemble those of the European buckthorn. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as slopes and grasslands. Its botanical features make it a notable species in arid and semi-arid ecosystems."
