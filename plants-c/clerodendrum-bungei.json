    "intro": "Clerodendrum bungei, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a flowering shrub native to East Asia. It features showy, papery bracts that resemble small lanterns, which are often more prominent than the actual small flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. The bracts, which are modified leaves, play a key role in attracting pollinators and enhancing the plant's ornamental value."
