    "intro": "Citronella paniculata, commonly known as citronella grass, is a tropical perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and clusters of small, fragrant, yellowish-white flowers. The plant is renowned for its strong lemon-scented leaves, which contain high concentrations of citronellol and geraniol. These compounds make it a popular choice for natural insect repellents. Citronella paniculata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated in warm, humid climates."
