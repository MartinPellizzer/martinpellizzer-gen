    "intro": "Calyptochloa johnsoniana, commonly known as Johnson's cryptochloa, is a small, mat-forming grass native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in wet, acidic soils, often found in swamps and bogs. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is enclosed by a hood-like bract. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
