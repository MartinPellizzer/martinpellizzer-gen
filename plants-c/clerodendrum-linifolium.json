    "intro": "Clerodendrum linifolium, commonly known as the silky clerodendrum, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite, linear leaves that give it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and showy inflorescences. It is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and is relatively easy to grow in warm, humid climates."
