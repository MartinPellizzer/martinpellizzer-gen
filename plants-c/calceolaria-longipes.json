    "intro": "Calceolaria longipes, commonly known as the long-footed slipperwort, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that are often brightly colored. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its elongated petals and specialized structure are adaptations that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Calceolaria longipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
