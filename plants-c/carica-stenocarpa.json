    "intro": "Carica stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited papaya, is a species of flowering plant in the Caricaceae family. It is native to Central and South America and is characterized by its large, fleshy, yellow-orange fruits. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a rough texture, and the flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. The fruit is edible, though it is less commonly cultivated compared to the more familiar papaya (Carica papaya)."
