    "intro": "Cousinia nujianensis, commonly known as the Nujian sand saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, reducing water loss. Cousinia nujianensis is adapted to sandy and rocky soils, making it a hardy species found in desert and semi-desert habitats."
