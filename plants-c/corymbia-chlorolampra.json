    "intro": "Corymbia chlorolampra, commonly known as the yellow bloodwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the tropical regions of northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey to yellowish bark that peels in thin, flaky layers. The tree produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly waxy texture. The species is known for its hard, heavy wood, which has been historically used by Indigenous Australians for tool-making and other cultural purposes."
