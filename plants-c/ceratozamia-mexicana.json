    "intro": "Ceratozamia mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and exhibits a slow growth rate. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Ceratozamia mexicana is considered endangered, making conservation efforts critical for its survival."
