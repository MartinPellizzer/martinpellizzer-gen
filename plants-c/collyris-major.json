    "intro": "Collyris major, commonly known as the greater collyris, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Amaranthaceae. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Collyris major is valued in traditional herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and diuretic properties."
