    "intro": "Cyrtanthera magnifica var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf magnifica orchid, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features elegant, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a container plant."
