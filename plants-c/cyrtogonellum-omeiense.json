    "intro": "Cyrtogonellum omeiense, commonly known as the Omeiense Cyrtogonellum, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and delicate flowers. The plant is notable for its small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Its botanical study contributes to the understanding of plant diversity in high-altitude ecosystems."
