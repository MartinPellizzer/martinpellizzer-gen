    "intro": "Carex montana f. truncata, commonly known as the truncated marsh sedge, is a perennial sedge native to North America. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often dark green and slightly curled at the tips. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are arranged in spikelets. This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more compact growth habit compared to other Carex species."
