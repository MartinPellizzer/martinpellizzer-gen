    "intro": "Cassine macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant sycamore, is a large evergreen tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its thick, flaky bark and large, lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its spread in the wild. Cassine macrocarpa is often found in moist, shaded habitats within its native range."
