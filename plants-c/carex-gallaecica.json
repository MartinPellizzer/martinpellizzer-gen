    "intro": "Carex gallaecica, commonly known as the Galician sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to western Europe, particularly found in coastal areas of Spain and Portugal. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, rushes, and reeds. This plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along cliffs and dunes, often in harsh maritime environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. Carex gallaecica is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
