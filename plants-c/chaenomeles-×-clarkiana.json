    "intro": "Chaenomeles \u00d7 clarkiana, commonly known as the Japanese flowering quince, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its showy, pink to red bracts that appear before the actual flowers, which are small and inconspicuous. The plant produces yellow, five-petaled flowers in early spring, followed by orange to red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its hardy nature and seasonal display make it a valuable addition to temperate landscapes."
