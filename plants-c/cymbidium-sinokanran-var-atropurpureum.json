    "intro": "Cymbidium sinokanran var. atropurpureum, commonly known as the Purple-leafed Cymbidium, is a species of orchid native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dark purple to almost black foliage, which contrasts strikingly with its white or pale pink flower spikes. The plant typically produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers during the winter months. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a potted plant."
