    "intro": "Corydalis glaucissima, commonly known as the glaucous corydalis, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces delicate, spurred flowers in shades of pink and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with a bluish-gray hue, which help it conserve moisture in arid environments. It is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Corydalis glaucissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
