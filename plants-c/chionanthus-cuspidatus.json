    "intro": "Chionanthus cuspidatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf chionanthus, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its elegant floral display and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
