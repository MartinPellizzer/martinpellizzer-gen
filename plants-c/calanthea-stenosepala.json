    "intro": "Calanthea stenosepala, commonly known as the narrow-sepaled calanthe, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Calanthea stenosepala thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
