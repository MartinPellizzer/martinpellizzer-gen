    "intro": "Candollea uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, solitary flower that typically blooms in shades of white or pale pink. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and a short, erect stem. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
