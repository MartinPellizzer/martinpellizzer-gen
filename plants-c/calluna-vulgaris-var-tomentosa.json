    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and its clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces tiny, dark blue to black berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and moorland environments. Its foliage is covered in a fine, white tomentum, giving it a distinctive, woolly appearance."
