    "intro": "Coronilla minima subsp. lotoides, commonly known as the small crown vetch, is a low-growing perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features small, trifoliate leaves and produces yellowish-white flowers in racemes during the summer months. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance."
