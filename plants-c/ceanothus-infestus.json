    "intro": "Ceanothus infestus, commonly known as the coastal ceanothus, is a shrub native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in coastal environments, tolerating salty air and well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically leathery and aromatic, contributing to its ecological importance as a habitat for native insects and birds. Ceanothus infestus is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
