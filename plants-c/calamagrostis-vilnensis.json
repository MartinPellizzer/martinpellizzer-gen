    "intro": "Calamagrostis vilnensis, commonly known as the Vilnius reed, is a perennial grass native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, feathery flowers that appear in late summer. Calamagrostis vilnensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
