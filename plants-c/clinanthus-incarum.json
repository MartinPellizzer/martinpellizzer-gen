It is a small tree or shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly serrated edge. The wood of Clinanthus incarum is valued for its dense, aromatic quality and has been traditionally used in carpentry and as a source of incense."
