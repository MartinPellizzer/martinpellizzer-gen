    "intro": "Cenchrus brevisetus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soils and low moisture conditions. Cenchrus brevisetus plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
