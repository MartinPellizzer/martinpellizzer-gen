    "intro": "Chamaedorea coralliformis, commonly known as the coral fern palm, is a compact, evergreen plant native to Central America. It features a slender trunk with a smooth, grayish-brown surface and produces delicate, feather-like fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance for low light and moderate humidity. Its unique coral-like branching pattern of leaves makes it a striking addition to any indoor space. It requires regular watering and well-draining soil to thrive."
