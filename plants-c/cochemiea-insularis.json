    "intro": "Cochemiea insularis, commonly known as the Socorro cholla, is a species of cactus native to the islands of Socorro and Guadalupe in the Gulf of California. It is a low-growing, spineless plant with a dense cluster of cylindrical stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Cochemiea insularis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
