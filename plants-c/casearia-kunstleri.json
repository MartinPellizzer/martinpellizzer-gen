    "intro": "Casearia kunstleri, commonly known as the velvetleaf casearia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom throughout the year, followed by orange-yellow berries containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
