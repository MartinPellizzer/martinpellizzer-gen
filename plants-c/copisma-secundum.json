    "intro": "Copisma secundum, commonly known as the lesser water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has small, floating leaves that are arranged in pairs, giving it a clover-like appearance. Its flowers are tiny and usually greenish-white, appearing in clusters. Copisma secundum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water oxygenation."
