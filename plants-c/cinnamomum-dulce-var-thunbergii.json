    "intro": "Cinnamomum dulce var. thunbergii, commonly known as Japanese cinnamon or Thunberg's cinnamon, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that emit a distinct cinnamon scent when crushed. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by dark blue berries containing smooth, glossy seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and medicinal properties. Due to its limited natural range, it is sometimes grown in botanical gardens and specialized horticultural settings."
