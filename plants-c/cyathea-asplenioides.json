    "intro": "Cyathea asplenioides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in dense forests. Its rhizome system helps it anchor to substrates and absorb moisture from the air. Cyathea asplenioides plays a role in tropical ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
