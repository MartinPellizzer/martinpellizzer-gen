    "intro": "Cyclosorus cuspidatus, commonly known as the spike moss, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are often clustered together, forming dense, moss-like growths. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rock crevices, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Cyclosorus cuspidatus plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
