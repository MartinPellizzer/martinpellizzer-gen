    "intro": "Cardamine millsiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water crowfoot, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist habitats such as streams, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes, and its leaves are arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem. The leaves are narrow and have a distinctive, lobed shape, with a delicate, fern-like appearance. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in a spherical inflorescence."
