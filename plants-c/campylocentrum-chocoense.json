    "intro": "Campylocentrum chocoense, commonly known as the Chocoan orchid, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Colombia and Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are broad and\u9769\u8d28, providing structural support and aiding in water retention. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
