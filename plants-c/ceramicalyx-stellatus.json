    "intro": "Ceramicalyx stellatus, commonly known as the star-flowered ceramicalyx, is a unique species belonging to the family Ceramidaceae. It is characterized by its striking star-shaped flowers that bloom in a vibrant array of colors, typically white or yellow. The plant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, Ceramicalyx stellatus is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
