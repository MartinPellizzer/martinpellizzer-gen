    "intro": "Cyperus scleropoae, commonly known as the rigid flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond edges, where it thrives in moist, poorly drained soils. Its flowering stems produce small, clustered flowers that are often inconspicuous, contributing to its role in aquatic ecosystems. Cyperus scleropoae plays a significant part in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
