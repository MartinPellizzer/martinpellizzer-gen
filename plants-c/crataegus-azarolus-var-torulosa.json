It is characterized by its thorny branches, ovate leaves with serrated margins, and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or scrubland habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and horticultural use."
