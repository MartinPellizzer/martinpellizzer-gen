    "intro": "Calonemorchis arenicola, commonly known as the sand lichen, is a unique lichen species that thrives in arid and sandy environments. It belongs to the family Caloplacaceae and is characterized by its crust-like growth form, which allows it to adhere tightly to rocky or sandy substrates. The organism is a symbiotic composite of a fungus and a green alga, which together perform photosynthesis and nutrient absorption. It is often found in coastal and inland deserts, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, Calonemorchis arenicola is considered an indicator species for environmental conditions in its native range."
