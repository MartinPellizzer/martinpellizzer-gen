    "intro": "Crepidomanes hainanense, commonly known as the Hainan crepidomanes, is a rare fern species native to the island of Hainan in China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
