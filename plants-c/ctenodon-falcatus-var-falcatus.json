    "intro": "Ctenodon falcatus var. falcatus, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern characterized by its long, narrow, sword-shaped fronds. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish. Its fronds are typically evergreen, and the plant produces sporangia on the undersides of the leaves, which release spores for reproduction. Ctenodon falcatus var. falcatus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor growing conditions."
