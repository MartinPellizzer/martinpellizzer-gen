    "intro": "Chelidonium haematodes, commonly known as the bloodflower, is a member of the Papaveraceae family, characterized by its striking red-orange flowers. It is a herbaceous perennial plant with a distinctive, branching stem and alternate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a poisonous plant and should be handled with care."
