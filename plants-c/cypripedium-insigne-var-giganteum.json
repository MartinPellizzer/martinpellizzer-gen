    "intro": "Cypripedium insigne var. giganteum, commonly known as the giant showy lady's slipper, is a striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. This variant is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically a deep pink or reddish hue. The plant features a robust rhizome and broad, leathery leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in cool, moist habitats and is often found in forest understories where it receives dappled sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is highly sought after in horticulture and conservation efforts."
