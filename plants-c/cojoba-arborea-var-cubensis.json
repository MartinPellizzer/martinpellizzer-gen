    "intro": "Cojoba arborea var. cubensis, commonly known as Cuban beach almond, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces oval, woody fruits that contain a single, hard seed. It thrives in sandy coastal soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its salt tolerance and ability to stabilize sand, it plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems."
