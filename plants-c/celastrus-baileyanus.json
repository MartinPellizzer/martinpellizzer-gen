    "intro": "Celastrus baileyanus, commonly known as the Chinese bindweed, is a deciduous climbing shrub native to China. It features opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red, berry-like fruits that are edible but have a bitter taste. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. Its rapid growth and climbing habit make it both ornamental and potentially invasive in certain environments."
