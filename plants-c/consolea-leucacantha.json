    "intro": "Consolea leucacantha, commonly known as the white-flowered cycad, is a species of cycad native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a branched structure, which are pollinated by insects. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a valuable but challenging plant for cultivation. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
