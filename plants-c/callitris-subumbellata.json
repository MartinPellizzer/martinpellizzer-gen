It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and dense, needle-like foliage. The plant thrives in coastal environments, particularly on rocky outcrops and sandy soils. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This hardy species is well adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds."
