    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis shiangpyungensis, commonly known as the Shiangpyung ironwood, is a rare evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts, and is characterized by its hard, dense wood. The plant produces small, cupule-enclosed acorns that take several years to mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
