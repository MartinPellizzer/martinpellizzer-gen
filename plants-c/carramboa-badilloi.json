    "intro": "Carramboa badilloi, commonly known as the Sierra Madre daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Carramboa badilloi is often found in rocky slopes and sandy soils, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
