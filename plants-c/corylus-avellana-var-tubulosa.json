    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. tubulosa, commonly known as the tubular hazel, is a variant of the hazelnut tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its unique tubular-shaped nuts, which are typically smaller and more elongated than those of the common hazel. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. The tubular hazel is also valued for its hardy nature and ability to adapt to various environmental conditions."
