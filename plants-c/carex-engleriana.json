    "intro": "Carex engleriana, commonly known as Engler's sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Native to regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant typically grows in shaded to semi-shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, making it a valuable species for erosion control and wetland restoration."
