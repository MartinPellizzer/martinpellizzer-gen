    "intro": "Cotyledon tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, adding visual interest to its appearance. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Cotyledon tomentosa thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
