    "intro": "Cotoneaster taitoensis, commonly known as the Taito cotoneaster, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to Japan and is characterized by its small, red berries that appear in the fall. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, and features simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas, where it contributes to the understory vegetation. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not as widely known as other cotoneaster species."
