It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as mesic forests, and thrives at high elevations. Its leaves are broad and oval, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in preserving its natural habitat."
