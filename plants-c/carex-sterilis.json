    "intro": "Carex sterilis, commonly known as the barren sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has narrow, grass-like blades that are usually green to bluish-green in color. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a habitat and food source for various invertebrates and birds."
