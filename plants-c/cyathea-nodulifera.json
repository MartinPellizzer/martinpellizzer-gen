    "intro": "Cyathea nodulifera, commonly known as the knob-ridge tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a distinctive feature of having knob-like protuberances along its trunk, which give it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Cyathea nodulifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in tropical gardens."
