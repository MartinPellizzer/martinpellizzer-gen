    "intro": "Carex tenuiformis var. elatior, commonly known as the slender flatleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. It is often found in riparian zones, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
