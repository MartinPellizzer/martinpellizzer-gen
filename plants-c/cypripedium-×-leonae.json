The plant is native to regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces a single flower per stem, making it a striking ornamental plant. The species is also noted for its ecological importance, supporting specific pollinators and contributing to biodiversity in its native habitats."
