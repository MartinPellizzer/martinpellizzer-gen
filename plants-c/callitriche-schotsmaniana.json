    "intro": "Callitriche schotsmaniana, commonly known as Schotsman's water starwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually submerged or barely emergent. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
