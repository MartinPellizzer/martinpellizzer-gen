    "intro": "Cinchona anderssonii, commonly known as the Andes quinine tree, is a species of evergreen tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many plants known for their medicinal properties. The plant is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Its bark contains alkaloids, notably quinine, which has historically been used in the treatment of malaria. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
