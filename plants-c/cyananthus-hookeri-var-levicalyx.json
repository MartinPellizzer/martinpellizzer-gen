    "intro": "Cyananthus hookeri var. levicalyx, commonly known as the Himalayan blue poppy, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet petals, which are often tinged with purple, and its delicate, clustered inflorescences. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found at elevations between 2,500 and 4,500 meters. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Due to its rarity and beauty, it is highly valued in botanical gardens and is considered an endangered species in its natural habitat."
