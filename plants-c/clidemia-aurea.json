    "intro": "Clidemia aurea, commonly known as golden mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The plant features small, white to yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, giving it a mist-like appearance. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Clidemia aurea is also noted for its ability to thrive in humid climates and is sometimes used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal."
