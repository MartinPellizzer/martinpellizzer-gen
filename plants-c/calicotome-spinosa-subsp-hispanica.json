It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, pale green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small yellow flowers in spring, followed by elongated, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to harsh, dry climates. This species is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in degraded areas."
