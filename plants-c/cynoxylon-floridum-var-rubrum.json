    "intro": "Cynoxylon floridum var. rubrum, commonly known as the Florida red cedar, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Cupressaceae family and is characterized by its reddish-brown bark and scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of significant botanical interest for its unique morphology and ecological role."
