    "intro": "Crotalaria jurioniana, commonly known as the yellow crotalaria, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers, which are typically clustered in racemes, and its trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. Crotalaria jurioniana is a herbaceous annual that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dry fields. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules."
