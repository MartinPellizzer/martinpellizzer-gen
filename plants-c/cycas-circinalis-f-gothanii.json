    "intro": "Cycas circinalis f. gothanii, commonly known as the Gothan's cycas, is a rare and ancient cycad species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with the female cones being particularly distinctive for their elongated, spiny structure. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
