    "intro": "Cucurbita verrucosa, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and spiny, paddle-shaped leaves. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which give way to fruits known as tunas. These fruits are edible and have a sweet, juicy flavor, often used in culinary and medicinal applications. Cucurbita verrucosa is adapted to arid environments and plays an important role in desert ecosystems."
