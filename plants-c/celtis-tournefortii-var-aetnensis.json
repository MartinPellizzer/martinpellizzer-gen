    "intro": "Celtis tournefortii var. aetnensis, commonly known as the Aetna hackberry, is a variant of the hackberry tree native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features small, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge and produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that turns yellowish when mature. This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh, arid conditions and its ecological importance in Mediterranean ecosystems."
