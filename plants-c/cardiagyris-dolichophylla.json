    "intro": "Cardiagyris dolichophylla, commonly known as the long-leaf heart-leaf plant, is a rare and unique species belonging to the family Restionaceae. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are often curved and have a distinctive heart-shaped base. The plant typically grows in coastal or sandy environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowering stems produce small, clustered inflorescences that are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
