    "intro": "Corydalis flexuosa subsp. balsamiflora, commonly known as the Balsam-flowered Corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often blooming in early summer. The plant has slender, creeping stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be challenging to grow outside its native environment."
