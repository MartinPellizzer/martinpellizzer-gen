    "intro": "Crotalaria pseudodelicata, commonly known as the African capsicum, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, and its leaves are palmately lobed with a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. The seeds are enclosed in a pod and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across various environments."
