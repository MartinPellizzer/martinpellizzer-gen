It is characterized by its fragrant, white, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped berries that are typically red or black when mature. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a serrated edge. Clethra montana thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a valuable addition to woodland gardens."
