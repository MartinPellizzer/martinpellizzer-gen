    "intro": "Citrosma laurifolia, commonly known as the white-flowered citrosma, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically not edible by humans but are used in traditional medicine. Its foliage is often used in perfumery and as a source of essential oils due to its strong, citrus-like scent. Citrosma laurifolia thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in forested areas."
