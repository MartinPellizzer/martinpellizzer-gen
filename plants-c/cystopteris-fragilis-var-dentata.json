    "intro": "Cystopteris fragilis var. dentata, commonly known as the fragrant brittle fern, is a delicate fern species characterized by its finely divided, often toothed fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to regions of the eastern United States and parts of Canada. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are usually light green, with a papery texture that contributes to its fragile appearance."
