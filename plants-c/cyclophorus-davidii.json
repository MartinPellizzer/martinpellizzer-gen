    "intro": "Cyclophorus davidii, commonly known as the David's cyclophorus, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
