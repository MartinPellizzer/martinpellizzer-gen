    "intro": "Carex parryana subsp. hallii, commonly known as Parry's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikes of pale to brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. It has narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly hairy, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
