    "intro": "Cydonia vulgaris var. pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal quince, is a cultivar of the quince plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright, pyramidal growth habit and thick, waxy leaves. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish flowers in spring, followed by large, citrus-scented fruits that ripen in late summer. The fruit is typically harvested when it turns a deep golden-orange color, indicating maturity. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruit, though it is less commonly cultivated for commercial purposes compared to other quince varieties."
