    "intro": "Cousinia caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and clusters of bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact growth habit, forming low, mat-like growths that help it survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. Cousinia caespitosa is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in regions with limited water availability."
