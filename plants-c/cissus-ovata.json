    "intro": "Cissus ovata, commonly known as the bone plant or grape ivy, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in tiny, translucent glands. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular choice for vertical gardens and indoor spaces."
