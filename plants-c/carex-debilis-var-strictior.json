    "intro": "Carex debilis var. strictior, commonly known as narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils in shaded to partially shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in wet meadows. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 1 inch in width, with a distinct central vein. It produces small, greenish-brown spikelets that are arranged in a loose, cylindrical shape. This variety is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
