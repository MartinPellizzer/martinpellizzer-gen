    "intro": "Cupressus glandulosa, commonly known as the narrowleaf canyon pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, columnar form and scale-like leaves that are densely packed along the branches. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, and its bark is thick, fissured, and reddish-gray in appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand drought conditions."
