It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other cruciferous plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine pubescence. Crambe sewerzowii is adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils."
