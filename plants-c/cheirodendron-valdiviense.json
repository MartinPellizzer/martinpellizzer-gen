    "intro": "Cheirodendron valdiviense, commonly known as the Valdivian cheirodendron, is a flowering plant native to the temperate rainforests of southern Chile and Argentina. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub with leathery, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing smooth, dark seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the cool, humid climate of its native range. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in conservation areas."
