    "intro": "Caladium divaricatum, commonly known as the variegated arrowleaf caladium, is a tropical perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that often display vibrant patterns of white, pink, and green. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is the primary ornamental feature, making it a popular choice for gardens and indoor spaces. Caladium divaricatum is typically propagated through tuberous roots, which can be planted in spring for optimal growth."
