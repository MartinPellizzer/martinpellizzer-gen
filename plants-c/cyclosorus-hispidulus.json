    "intro": "Cyclosorus hispidulus, commonly known as the hairy cyclosorus, is a small, perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, which gives it its common name. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Cyclosorus hispidulus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitat."
