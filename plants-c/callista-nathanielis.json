    "intro": "Callista nathanielis, commonly known as the Nathaniel's ghostflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent petals that emit a faint glow in the dark, a trait unique to its species. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires a specific symbiotic relationship with a particular species of mycorrhizal fungi to survive. Its flowers bloom only during the brief period of the lunar eclipse, making it one of the most elusive plants in the botanical world. Due to its rarity and ecological specificity, Callista nathanielis is critically endangered and protected by international conservation laws."
