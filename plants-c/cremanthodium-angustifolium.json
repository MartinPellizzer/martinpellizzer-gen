    "intro": "Cremanthodium angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed cremanthodium, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Andes in South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its narrow, linear leaves are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh climates, and it produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
