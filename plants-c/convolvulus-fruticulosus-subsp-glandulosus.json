    "intro": "Convolvulus fruticulosus subsp. glandulosus, commonly known as the glandular hairy bindweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, pale yellow flowers with five petals. The subspecies is distinguished by its glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. This plant is also known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, making it both a weed and a valuable source of nectar for pollinators."
