    "intro": "Crataegus succulenta, commonly known as the succulent hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, a feature adapted to its often arid or semi-arid habitats. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its bark is typically smooth and gray, with distinctive ridges that become more pronounced with age. Crataegus succulenta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
