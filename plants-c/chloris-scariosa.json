    "intro": "Chloris scariosa, commonly known as the scarious grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
