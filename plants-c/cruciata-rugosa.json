    "intro": "Cruciata rugosa, commonly known as the rough crasswort, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. It is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in full sun. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
