    "intro": "Clematis montana var. manipurensis, commonly known as the Manipur clematis, is a vigorous climbing vine native to the northeastern regions of India. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are typically white or pale blue, with a distinctive, fragrant aroma. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires support for its long, twisting stems. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
