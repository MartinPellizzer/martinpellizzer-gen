    "intro": "Cuscuta sicula, commonly known as the Italian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that\u7f20\u7ed5 around its host. The plant is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, often found growing on crops like tomatoes and beans. Its seeds are dispersed by wind and can remain viable in the soil for many years. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
