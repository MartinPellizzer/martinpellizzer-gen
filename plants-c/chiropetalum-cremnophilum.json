    "intro": "Chiropetalum cremnophilum, commonly known as the rock petal orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude habitats. The plant features slender stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, it is classified as endangered, highlighting the need for protective measures."
