    "intro": "Carex nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, rushes, and grass-like plants. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinct midrib that gives it its common name. Carex nervosa produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers."
