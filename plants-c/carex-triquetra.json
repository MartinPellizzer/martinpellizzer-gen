    "intro": "Carex triquetra, commonly known as the three-angled sedge, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in three distinct rows, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear greenish-yellow flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Carex triquetra is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
