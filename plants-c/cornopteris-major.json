    "intro": "Cornopteris major, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to three feet in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are robust and help it spread through underground runners. The fronds are divided into segments with a distinctive, toothed margin that gives it its common name."
