    "intro": "Cotoneaster sanguineus, commonly known as the red cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that turn red in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that persist into winter. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it suitable for a variety of garden settings. Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it is often used in landscaping and as a hedge plant."
