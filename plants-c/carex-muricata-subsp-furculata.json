    "intro": "Carex muricata subsp. furculata, commonly known as the hooked sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its cylindrical, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant thrives in wet or moist environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It has a fibrous root system and is often used in wetland restoration projects. Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in morphology compared to the main species, Carex muricata."
