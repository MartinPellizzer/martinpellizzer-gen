    "intro": "Cheiranthera cyanea, commonly known as the blue orchid, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a delicate fragrance. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its colorful blooms. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cheiranthera cyanea is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
