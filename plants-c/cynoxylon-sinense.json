    "intro": "Cynoxylon sinense, commonly known as the Chinese sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to southern China and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored wood that is highly valued in traditional craftsmanship. The plant has simple, opposite, and elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green in color. It produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by oval, dark brown fruits. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
