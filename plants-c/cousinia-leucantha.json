    "intro": "Cousinia leucantha, commonly known as the whiteflower globemallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Cousinia leucantha is also used in traditional medicine in some regions for its purported health benefits."
