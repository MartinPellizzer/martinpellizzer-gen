    "intro": "Caltha palustris var. major, commonly known as the greater marsh marigold, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It features showy, yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are broad and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and woodland edges. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
