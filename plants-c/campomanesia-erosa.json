    "intro": "Campomanesia erosa, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or erosa cheesefruit, is a small evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that give way to edible, yellow-orange fruits with a tangy, slightly tart flavor. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and fruit, it is sometimes cultivated in subtropical regions for both aesthetic and culinary purposes."
