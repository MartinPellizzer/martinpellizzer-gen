    "intro": "Carex ursina, commonly known as the bear's garlic or bear's onion, is a perennial sedge native to the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
