    "intro": "Ceanothus cuneatus var. cinerascens, commonly known as the cinerascens ceanothus, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves that often have a silvery appearance due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant blue or purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
