    "intro": "Caroxylon tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly acacia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly coating on its stems and leaves, which provides insulation and protection against herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in spherical clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in its native habitat."
