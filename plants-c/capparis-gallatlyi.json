    "intro": "Capparis gallatlyi, commonly known as the desert caper, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems, small greenish-white flowers, and edible, tangy fruits that are often used in local cuisines. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water, featuring thick leaves and deep root systems. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat. The plant's resilience and unique flavor make it both ecologically and culturally significant in its native range."
