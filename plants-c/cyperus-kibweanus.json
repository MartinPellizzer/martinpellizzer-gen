    "intro": "Cyperus kibweanus, commonly known as the Kibwean flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, poorly drained soils. Its slender, triangular stems are often covered in fine, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered flower heads. Cyperus kibweanus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
