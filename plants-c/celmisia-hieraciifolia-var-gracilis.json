    "intro": "Celmisia hieraciifolia var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender leaf celmisia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are finely divided and covered in a soft, hairy texture. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
