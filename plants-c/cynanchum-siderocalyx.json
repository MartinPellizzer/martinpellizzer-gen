    "intro": "Cynanchum siderocalyx, commonly known as iron-leafed milkweed, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its latex is milky and somewhat toxic. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Cynanchum siderocalyx is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
