It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Calandrinia callithrix is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
