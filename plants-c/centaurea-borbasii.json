    "intro": "Centaurea borbasii, commonly known as the Borbas's cornflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its bright blue or purple flowers and spiky bracts, which are typical of the genus Centaurea. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind. Centaurea borbasii is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and along coastal areas."
