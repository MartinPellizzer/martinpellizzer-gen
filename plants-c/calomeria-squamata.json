    "intro": "Calomeria squamata, commonly known as the scaly cholla, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spine-tipped stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming dense, shrub-like structures adapted to desert conditions. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss. Calomeria squamata is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
