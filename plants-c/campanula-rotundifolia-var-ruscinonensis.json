    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia var. ruscinonensis, commonly known as the Ruscinian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its round, broad leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and hardiness. This variety is closely related to other campanula species but is distinguished by its unique leaf shape and floral characteristics."
