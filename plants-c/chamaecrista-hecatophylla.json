    "intro": "Chamaecrista hecatophylla, commonly known as the yellow burr legume, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, followed by distinctive, spiny pods that contain seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, with many small, feather-like leaflets. Chamaecrista hecatophylla is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
