    "intro": "Conohoria owariensis, commonly known as the Owari fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green with a slight silvery sheen. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found growing in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it has a slow growth rate, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
