    "intro": "Carex fallax var. pseudoarenicola, commonly known as the sand sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern United States and southern Canada. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a hardy choice for coastal or disturbed sites. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers in the summer. It is often used in native plant gardens for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife. Its botanical characteristics make it an excellent example of a plant adapted to harsh, open environments."
