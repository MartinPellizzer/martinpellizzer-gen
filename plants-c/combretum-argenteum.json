    "intro": "Combretum argenteum, commonly known as silver flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its striking silver-white undersides on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by capsule fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and parks in warm climates."
