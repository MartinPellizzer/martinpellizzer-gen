    "intro": "Cerastium glomeratum var. mauritianum, commonly known as the Mauritius mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the island of Mauritius. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
