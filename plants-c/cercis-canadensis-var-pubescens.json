It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are hairy on the underside, giving it a distinctive texture. The tree produces showy, white, trumpet-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by long, bean-like pods. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
