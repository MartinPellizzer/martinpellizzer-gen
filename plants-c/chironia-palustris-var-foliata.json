    "intro": "Chironia palustris var. foliata, commonly known as the broadleaf marsh fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically broad and deeply lobed, with a distinctive, soft green color. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in its wetland environment. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting diverse insect and bird life within its habitat."
