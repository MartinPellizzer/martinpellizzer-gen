It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its root system is extensive and adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
