    "intro": "Ctenopteris punctata, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often used in ornamental horticulture. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that produce new shoots. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. Ctenopteris punctata thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to flourish."
