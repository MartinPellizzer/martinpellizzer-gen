    "intro": "Critonia peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular Critonia, is a rare flowering plant native to the southern tip of the Iberian Peninsula. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family, characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
