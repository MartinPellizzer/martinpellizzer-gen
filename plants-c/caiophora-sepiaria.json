    "intro": "Caiophora sepiaria, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant produces small, cylindrical seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal along shorelines. It is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils near the coast, where it can tolerate high salinity and strong sea winds. Its unique appearance and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in coastal botany."
