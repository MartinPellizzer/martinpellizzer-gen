    "intro": "Caulopsis alpina, commonly known as the alpine cauliflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other members such as mustard and cabbage. The plant is characterized by its compact rosette of thick, fleshy leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Caulopsis alpina is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
