    "intro": "Cyclosorus modestus, commonly known as the small water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Oleandraceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. Cyclosorus modestus plays a minor role in aquatic ecosystems, contributing to water filtration and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
