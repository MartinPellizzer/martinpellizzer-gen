    "intro": "Ctenopteris fuscata, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce dense clusters of fronds, which contribute to its ornamental value. Ctenopteris fuscata is often cultivated for its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions."
