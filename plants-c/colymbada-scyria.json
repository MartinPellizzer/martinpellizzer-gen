    "intro": "Colymbada scyria, commonly known as the common marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats across Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of pale pink or white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The species is also notable for its ability to tolerate seasonal flooding, making it an important indicator plant for wetland ecosystems."
