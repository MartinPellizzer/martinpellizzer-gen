    "intro": "Cypripedium calceolus var. citrinum, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow pouch-shaped flower, which is covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in cool, moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single, showy flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
