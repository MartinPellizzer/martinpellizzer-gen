    "intro": "Corchorus brevicornutus, commonly known as the short-horned spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while the plant produces capsules that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Corchorus brevicornutus is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments."
