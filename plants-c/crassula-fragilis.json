    "intro": "Crassula fragilis, commonly known as the brittle crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact, rounded rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
