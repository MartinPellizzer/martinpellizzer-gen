    "intro": "Calystegia asarifolia, commonly known as the asarifolia bindweed, is a flowering plant in the family Convolvulaceae. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit and produces trumpet-shaped, white to pale purple flowers. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and is native to regions in Asia, including China and the Himalayas. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
