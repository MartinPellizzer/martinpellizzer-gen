    "intro": "Convolvulus aculeatus, commonly known as burweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy, spiny stems that help in seed dispersal. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, roadsides, and wastelands. Due to its invasive nature in some areas, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
