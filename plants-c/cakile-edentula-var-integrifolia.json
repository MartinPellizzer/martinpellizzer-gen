    "intro": "Cakile edentula var. integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fleshy, lobed leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiny capsule that disperses easily by wind. This species is adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient component of desert and coastal ecosystems."
