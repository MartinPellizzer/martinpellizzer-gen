    "intro": "Cereus callicoche, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems and spiny, ribbed structure. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to arid environments. The flowers typically bloom once a year, making it a striking feature in desert landscapes."
