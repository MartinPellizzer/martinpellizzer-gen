    "intro": "Cotoneaster naninitens, commonly known as the dwarf cotoneaster, is a small evergreen shrub native to China. It features dense, compact growth with small, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its low stature and hardiness. Cotoneaster naninitens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
