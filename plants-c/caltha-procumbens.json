    "intro": "Caltha procumbens, commonly known as the yellow avens, is a low-growing perennial herb native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Caltha procumbens is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
