    "intro": "Castiglionia lobata, commonly known as the lobed castiglionia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive lobed leaves, which are often deeply divided and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Castiglionia lobata thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often found in grasslands and rocky outcrops, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat."
