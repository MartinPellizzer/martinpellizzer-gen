    "intro": "Chupalon scabriusculum, commonly known as the rough-hairy chupalon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features upright, branched stems covered in rough, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and also covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Chupalon scabriusculum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
