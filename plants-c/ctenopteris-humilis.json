    "intro": "Ctenopteris humilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sea palm, is a species of fern native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and fronds that are typically narrow and strap-like. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in tidal zones or near the shoreline. Its fronds are divided into segments with a distinctive, feather-like appearance. Ctenopteris humilis is well adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic inundation, making it a resilient coastal plant."
