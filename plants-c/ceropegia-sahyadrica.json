    "intro": "Ceropegia sahyadrica, commonly known as the Western Ghats moonvine, is a climbing plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale green, often with a distinctive hooded structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the humid climate of its native region. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
