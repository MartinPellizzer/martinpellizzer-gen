    "intro": "Corydalis pseudoscaberula, commonly known as the rough-stemmed corydalis, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Fumariaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and clusters of small, pinkish-purple flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
