    "intro": "Carex tenera var. suberecta, commonly known as the upright sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in dense, compact clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are usually wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
