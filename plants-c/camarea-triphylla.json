It belongs to the Araceae family, which includes plants such as philodendrons and calla lilies. The plant features a short, rhizomatous stem with three distinct, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, typical of many arum family members. Camarea triphylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in warm, humid environments."
