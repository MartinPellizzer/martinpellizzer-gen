    "intro": "Crepidium damusicum, commonly known as the Damascene orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil. Despite its delicate appearance, it is relatively hardy and can thrive in well-drained, acidic soils."
