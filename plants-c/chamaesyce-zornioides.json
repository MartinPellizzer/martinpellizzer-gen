It is a low-growing annual or biennial species belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant features small, green, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain habitats."
