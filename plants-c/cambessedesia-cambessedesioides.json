It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, followed by small, round fruits that contain a single seed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species, making it a subject of interest for botanical research and conservation efforts."
