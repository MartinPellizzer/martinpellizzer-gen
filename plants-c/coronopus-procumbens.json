    "intro": "Coronopus procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate crownwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming habit with creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
