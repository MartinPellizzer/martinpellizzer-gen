    "intro": "Carex divisa var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sedges, is a member of the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with three stamens and a single pistil, typical of the sedge family."
