    "intro": "Cyrtopodium cachimboense, commonly known as the Cachimbo Cypripedium, is a rare orchid species native to the Amazon rainforest of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in the early spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and produces a single, fragrant flower with a distinctive lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of dense forests. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
