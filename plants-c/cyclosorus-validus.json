    "intro": "Cyclosorus validus, commonly known as the yellow water clover, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and creeping rhizomes that help it spread across wetland environments. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in ponds and marshes. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer. Cyclosorus validus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish."
