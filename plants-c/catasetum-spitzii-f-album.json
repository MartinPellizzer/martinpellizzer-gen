    "intro": "Catasetum spitzii f. album, commonly known as the white form of the Spitz's orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. This variant is characterized by its large, showy white flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, which is a key feature in orchid taxonomy. The plant typically grows on trees, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. It prefers high humidity and indirect light, making it a challenging but rewarding species for orchid enthusiasts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and endangered plant in the wild."
