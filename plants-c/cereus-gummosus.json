    "intro": "Cereus gummosus, commonly known as the gummosis cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a tall, columnar cactus that can grow up to 10 meters in height, featuring a smooth, green stem with a waxy coating. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its roots are shallow and adapted to absorb moisture from the dry soil, while its stems store water for extended periods. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in harsh environments."
