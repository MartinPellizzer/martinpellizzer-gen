    "intro": "Carex doniana var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf swamp sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, with small, spike-like inflorescences that produce wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. This species is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its aesthetic appeal in water garden settings."
