    "intro": "Castilleja aurea, commonly known as the golden paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces striking orange to yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small and reduced, often appearing as bracts beneath the flower cluster. Castilleja aurea thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands."
