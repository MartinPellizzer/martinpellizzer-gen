    "intro": "Coccothrinax gundlachii, commonly known as the Key West palm, is a small, cold-hardy palm native to the Florida Keys and the Bahamas. It is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and feather-like, dark green leaves that form a dense crown. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by dark blue, fleshy fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found in sandy soils near the shoreline. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions."
