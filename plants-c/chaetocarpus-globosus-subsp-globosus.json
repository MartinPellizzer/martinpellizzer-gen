    "intro": "Chaetocarpus globosus subsp. globosus, commonly known as the globe sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cariophyllaceae. It is characterized by its globular, fleshy fruits that are often brightly colored, which serve as a means of attracting seed-dispersing animals. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and well-drained soils. Its leaves are succulent and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It is a perennial species that produces showy, pink or white flowers throughout the growing season."
