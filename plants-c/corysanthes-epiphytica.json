    "intro": "Corysanthes epiphytica, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is an epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It grows on the trunks and branches of trees, using them for physical support rather than deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its pale green, strap-like leaves and its striking, white, spider-like flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air humidity and minimal direct sunlight. Due to its specialized habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
