    "intro": "Cinnamomum ampullaceum, commonly known as the Malabar cinnamon or Ceylon cinnamon, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of India, Sri Lanka, and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown bark, which is prized for its flavor and medicinal properties. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by oval, dark blue fruits containing winged seeds. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and have a slightly serrated edge. This species is closely related to other cinnamon species but is distinguished by its unique aroma and the specific shape of its fruits."
