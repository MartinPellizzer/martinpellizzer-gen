It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces tiny greenish-white flowers that are often inconspicuous and clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Its leaves and stems are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though it is generally considered a weed."
