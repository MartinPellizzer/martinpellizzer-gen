    "intro": "Celtis tenuifolia var. soperi, commonly known as the Soper's hackberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically light green and have a slightly pubescent underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by small, round berries that turn dark blue when mature. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight. The Soper's hackberry is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate urban conditions."
