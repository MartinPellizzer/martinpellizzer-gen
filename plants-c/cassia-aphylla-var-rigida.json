    "intro": "Cassia aphylla var. rigida, commonly known as the rigid cassia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The rigid cassia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract native pollinators."
