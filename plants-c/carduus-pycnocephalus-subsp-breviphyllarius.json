    "intro": "Carduus pycnocephalus subsp. breviphyllarius, commonly known as the short-leaved thistle, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and scrub habitats. Its leaves are thick and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter, more compact leaves compared to other members of the Carduus genus."
