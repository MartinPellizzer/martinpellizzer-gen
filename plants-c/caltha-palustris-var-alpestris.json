    "intro": "Caltha palustris var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine marsh marigold, is a variant of the marsh marigold native to alpine and subalpine regions. It is a perennial herbaceous plant with yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It plays an important role in alpine ecosystems by providing early-season nectar for pollinators."
