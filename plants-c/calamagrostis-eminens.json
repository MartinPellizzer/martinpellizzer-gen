    "intro": "Calamagrostis eminens, commonly known as the tall golden grass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and feathery, golden-yellow plumes that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in wetlands, swamps, or along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly rough texture. Calamagrostis eminens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
