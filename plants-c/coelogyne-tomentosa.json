    "intro": "Coelogyne tomentosa, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall. Its flowers are typically borne on arching stems and can last for several weeks. Coelogyne tomentosa is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
