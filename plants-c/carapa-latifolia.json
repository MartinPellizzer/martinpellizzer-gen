    "intro": "Carapa latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are typically broad and leathery in texture. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elongated, woody pods containing several seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a significant resource in local economies. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
