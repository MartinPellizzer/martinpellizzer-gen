    "intro": "Callista bedfordiana, commonly known as the Bedford's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a unique morphology, featuring a slender, unbranched stem and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is typically found growing on the trunks of rainforest trees. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Callista bedfordiana is considered a conservation priority."
