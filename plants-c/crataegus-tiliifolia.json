    "intro": "Crataegus tiliifolia, commonly known as the silky crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that appear in early spring. The leaves are typically oval to elliptical with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, and they turn a vibrant red or orange in the fall. The fruit is a small, yellowish apple that ripens in late summer, often used in culinary or medicinal applications. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and full to partial sunlight."
