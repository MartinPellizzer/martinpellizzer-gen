    "intro": "Cereus moritzianus, commonly known as the Moritz's night bloomer, is a cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking, large white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. Cereus moritzianus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming habit."
