    "intro": "Cheiropteris, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic ferns belonging to the family Pteridaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, floating leaves that are often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The fronds of Cheiropteris are typically divided into small, narrow segments, giving them a lacy appearance. They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life. Due to their unique adaptations, Cheiropteris species are often used in water gardens and as indicators of water quality."
