    "intro": "Cynanchum giraldii, commonly known as the giant milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. Cynanchum giraldii is known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds and is a defense mechanism against herbivores."
