    "intro": "Cyrtandra milnei, commonly known as the Kauai ironwood, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its woody structure and evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. Cyrtandra milnei thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories on wet mountain slopes. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
