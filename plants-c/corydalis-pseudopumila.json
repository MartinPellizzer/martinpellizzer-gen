    "intro": "Corydalis pseudopumila, commonly known as the dwarf corydalis, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, thread-like stems and clusters of small, spurred flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing pink or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils in shaded or partially shaded environments. Corydalis pseudopumila is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and easy care requirements."
