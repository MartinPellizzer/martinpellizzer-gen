    "intro": "Caroxylon hispidulum, commonly known as the hispid desert shrub, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions. Caroxylon hispidulum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
