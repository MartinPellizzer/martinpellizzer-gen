    "intro": "Cuphea arvensis, commonly known as the common cuphea, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which are clustered in whorls along the stem. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, often with a slight pubescence, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Cuphea arvensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
