It features trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinct purple or red throat. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Chavica radicans thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
