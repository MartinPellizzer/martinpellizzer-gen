    "intro": "Cacao guianensis, commonly known as the Amazonian cacao tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Theaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves and small, white flowers that bloom along the stems. The tree produces pods that contain bitter, sweet-tasting seeds, which are the source of cocoa mass used in chocolate production. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil and requires consistent moisture. Due to its ecological importance and economic value, it is often cultivated in agroforestry systems to promote biodiversity and sustainable farming."
