It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes other economically important plants like the cashew and mango. The plant is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and produces small, clustered yellow flowers. Its fruits are fleshy, red berries that contain seeds, and it is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
