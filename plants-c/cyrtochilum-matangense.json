    "intro": "Cyrtochilum matangense, commonly known as the Matangense orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, which is essential for its survival in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cyrtochilum matangense is considered a threatened species."
