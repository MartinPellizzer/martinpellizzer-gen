    "intro": "Calendula suffruticosa subsp. maroccana, commonly known as Moroccan marigold, is a shrub-like plant native to North Africa. It features aromatic, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has woody stems and hairy leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It is often used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to dry, rocky soils and full sun exposure."
