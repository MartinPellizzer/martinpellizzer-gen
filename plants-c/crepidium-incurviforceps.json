    "intro": "Crepidium incurviforceps, commonly known as the curved-spurred orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its unique floral structure includes a curved spur that serves as a nectar reservoir, attracting specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
