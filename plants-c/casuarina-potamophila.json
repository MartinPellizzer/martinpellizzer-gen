    "intro": "Casuarina potamophila, commonly known as the river casuarina, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a small tree or shrub with feathery, needle-like leaves that are arranged in clusters. The plant produces small, cylindrical flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It thrives in coastal and saline environments, making it well adapted to sandy soils and salt spray. Casuarina potamophila is often used for dune stabilization due to its strong root system and ability to tolerate harsh conditions."
