    "intro": "Coffea arabica var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf coffee, is a variant of the Arabica coffee species characterized by its broader, more elongated leaves. This variety is native to Ethiopia and is known for its unique leaf morphology, which distinguishes it from other Coffea species. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries containing the seeds used for coffee. Due to its limited cultivation and specific growing conditions, it is considered a rare and less commercially significant coffee variety."
