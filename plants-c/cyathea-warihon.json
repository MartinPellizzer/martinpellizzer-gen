    "intro": "Cyathea warihon, commonly known as the Warihon tree fern, is a species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant is evergreen and can grow up to several meters in height, with a slow growth rate. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas."
