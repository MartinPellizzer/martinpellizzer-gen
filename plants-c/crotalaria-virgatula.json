    "intro": "Crotalaria virgatula, commonly known as the small cowpea or velvet bean, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It features erect stems with alternate, ovate leaves that are often pubescent. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by capsule fruits containing several seeds. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a valuable plant in agricultural systems. However, it can also be invasive in some regions and may cause skin irritation due to its toxic alkaloids."
