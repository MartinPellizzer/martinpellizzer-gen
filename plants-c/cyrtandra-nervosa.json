    "intro": "Cyrtandra nervosa, commonly known as the veined cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Pacific. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial with slender, branching stems and opposite leaves that are often veined. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Cyrtandra nervosa is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and stream banks."
