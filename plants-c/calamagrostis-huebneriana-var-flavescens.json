    "intro": "Calamagrostis huebneriana var. flavescens, commonly known as the golden moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to the wetlands of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green to golden in color. The plant produces panicles of small, pale green to yellowish flowers in late summer, which contribute to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. This variety is valued in landscaping for its ability to stabilize soil and its attractive, feathery appearance."
