    "intro": "Culcitium glaciale, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a hardy perennial plant native to the cold regions of the Arctic and subarctic. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. Culcitium glaciale plays an important role in the ecosystems of its native habitats by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
