    "intro": "Cupressus nobleana, commonly known as the noble fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and light green underneath. The tree produces small, spherical cones that typically mature in the second year. Its bark is reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age, adding to its ornamental value. Cupressus nobleana is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
