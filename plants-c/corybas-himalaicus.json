    "intro": "Corybas himalaicus, commonly known as the Himalayan hooded orchid, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, hood-like flower structure that encloses the reproductive organs. The plant typically grows in rocky or mossy habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually dark purple or black, with a striking contrast provided by the yellowish throat. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species."
