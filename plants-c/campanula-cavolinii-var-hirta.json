It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its botanical name \"hirta,\" meaning hairy in Latin. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. It prefers well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Campanula cavolinii var. hirta is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries."
