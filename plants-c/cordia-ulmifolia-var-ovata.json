    "intro": "Cordia ulmifolia var. ovata, commonly known as the oval-leaf cordia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by fleshy, orange-red fruits. Its botanical features make it a notable species in both horticulture and ecological studies. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
