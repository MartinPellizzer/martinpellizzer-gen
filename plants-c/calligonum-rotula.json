    "intro": "Calligonum rotula, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 centimeters, characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Calligonum rotula is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sand dunes and prevent soil erosion."
