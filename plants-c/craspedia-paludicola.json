    "intro": "Craspedia paludicola, commonly known as the marsh craspedia, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Australia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered with fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, swampy environments. Craspedia paludicola plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
