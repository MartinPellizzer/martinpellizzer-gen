    "intro": "Cerastium erectum, commonly known as snow in the grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features wiry stems that often lie flat on the ground, producing clusters of tiny, white flowers in early spring. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is known for its ability to spread rapidly through runners."
