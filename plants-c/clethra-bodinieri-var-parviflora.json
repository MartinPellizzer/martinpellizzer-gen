    "intro": "Clethra bodinieri var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered sweet pepper bush, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and floral display. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens."
