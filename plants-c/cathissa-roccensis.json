    "intro": "Cathissa roccensis, commonly known as the Rocky Cathissa, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of southern Italy. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green or white, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with hot, dry summers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cathissa roccensis is considered a vulnerable species."
