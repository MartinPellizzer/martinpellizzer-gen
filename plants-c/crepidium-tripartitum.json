    "intro": "Crepidium tripartitum, commonly known as the three-parted orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its intricate floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanical researchers. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its natural range."
