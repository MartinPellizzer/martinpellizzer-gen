    "intro": "Chaiturus leonuroides, commonly known as the golden star lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It features striking, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive star-shaped pattern, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in suitable conditions. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated for its vibrant floral display and easy maintenance."
