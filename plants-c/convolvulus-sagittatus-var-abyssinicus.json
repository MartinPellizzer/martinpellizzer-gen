It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, spiral-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant is a climbing vine with hairy stems and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a decorative climbing plant.
