    "intro": "Centaurea montana subsp. axillaris, commonly known as the alpine cornflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller flowers and shorter stature compared to the typical C. montana. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators in its native habitat."
