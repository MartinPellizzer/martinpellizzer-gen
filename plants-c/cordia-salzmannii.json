    "intro": "Cordia salzmannii, commonly known as the African snowball, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by round, fleshy fruits that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Cordia salzmannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
