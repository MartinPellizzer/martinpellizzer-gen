    "intro": "Cydoniorchis tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, four-angled stem and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant prefers cool, humid environments and is often found growing in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces showy, pinkish-white blooms that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cydoniorchis tetragona is considered a conservation concern."
