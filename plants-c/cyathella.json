    "intro": "Cyathella, commonly known as the star-shaped flower or cyathella lily, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asparagaceae. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which consists of a spathaceous bract that encloses the true flowers. The plant typically produces small, clustered flowers that are often arranged in a star-like pattern, giving it its common name. Cyathella species are native to various regions in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their striking and unusual floral display."
