    "intro": "Cistus halimifolius, commonly known as the sweet rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and fragrant, pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and coastal environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss, a feature adapted to its drought-tolerant nature. The plant is also known for its essential oils, which are used in perfumery and traditional medicine."
