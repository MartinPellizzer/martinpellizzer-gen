    "intro": "Calanthe sylvatica var. pallidipetala, commonly known as the pale-petaled forest calanthe, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of pale to white flowers with elongated petals and a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
