    "intro": "Cynoctonum erubescens, commonly known as the red-flowered cycad, is a species of cycad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces striking, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
