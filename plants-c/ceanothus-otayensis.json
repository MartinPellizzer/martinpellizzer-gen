    "intro": "Ceanothus otayensis, commonly known as Otay ceanothus, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States, particularly California and Baja California. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal sage scrub and chaparral habitats. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like blue or purple flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are generally narrow and evergreen, adapted to the dry, Mediterranean climate of its native range. Ceanothus otayensis plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its ecosystem."
