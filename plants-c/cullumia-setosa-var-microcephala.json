It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. This variety is distinguished by its smaller flower heads compared to other Cullumia species, making it a unique and ornamental addition to native plant gardens."
