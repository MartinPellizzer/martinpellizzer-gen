    "intro": "Cirsium palustre var. spinosissimum, commonly known as the spiked thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas of northern Europe. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, covered with stiff, spiny bracts. The plant produces purple to pink flower heads, which are composed of numerous small florets arranged in a composite flower structure. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with rough, serrated edges and a distinctive white to pale green underside. This variety is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
