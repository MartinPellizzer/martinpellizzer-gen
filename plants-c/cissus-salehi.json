    "intro": "Cissus salehi, commonly known as the silver dollar plant, is a climbing vine native to southern Africa. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often variegated with silver or white markings. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round fruits resembling silver coins. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cissus salehi is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and ease of care."
