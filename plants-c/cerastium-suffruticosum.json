    "intro": "Cerastium suffruticosum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically forms dense mats on the ground, often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are borne on slender stems and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The species is characterized by its succulent leaves and is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance."
