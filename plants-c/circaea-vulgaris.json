    "intro": "Circaea vulgaris, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It features small, white or pinkish flowers and has hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often mistaken for mouse ears. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a creeping stem that produces numerous flowering shoots. Its botanical characteristics make it a common sight in temperate regions, often found in disturbed or shaded soils."
