It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, typically blooming in summer. Its leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks."
