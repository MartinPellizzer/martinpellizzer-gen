    "intro": "Colchicum decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive autumn crocus, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces striking purple or white flowers in the autumn, which are often mistaken for true crocuses but bloom later in the season. The plant has a distinctive, spathaceous leaf that resembles a flower, leading to its common name. Its bulbs contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Colchicum decipiens thrives in woodland and grassland habitats, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade."
