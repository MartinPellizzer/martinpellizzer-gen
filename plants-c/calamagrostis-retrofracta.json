    "intro": "Calamagrostis retrofracta, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands, where it thrives in full sun. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, fluffy flowers that appear in late summer. Calamagrostis retrofracta is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in ecological restoration projects."
