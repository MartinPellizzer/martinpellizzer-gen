    "intro": "Commelina erecta subsp. maritima, commonly known as sea bluemink, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or saline soils along shorelines. The plant features slender, upright stems and small, blue-violet flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its leaves are linear and often covered with a fine, silky hair, which helps reduce water loss in its salty environment. This subspecies is adapted to withstand salt spray and wind, making it a hardy plant in coastal habitats."
