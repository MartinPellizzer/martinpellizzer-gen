It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Clutia diversifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks."
