    "intro": "Cicuta cynapium, commonly known as poison hemlock, is a biennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or greenish flowers. The plant contains toxic compounds, primarily cicutoine and other glycosides, which can be lethal to humans and animals. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and in meadows. Due to its high toxicity, it is often considered a noxious weed and requires careful handling."
