    "intro": "Carex goodenowii f. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf goodenow sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, clustered spikelets that produce wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows or along stream banks. Its compact size and ability to form dense mats make it an effective ground cover in wetland restoration projects. Botanically, it is distinguished by its reduced leaf structure and unique floral morphology compared to other sedges."
