    "intro": "Catasetum adremedium, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and compact growth habit. The plant produces a unique structure called a \"labellum,\" which is modified to aid in pollination by specific wasps. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the humid environment of its natural habitat. Catasetum adremedium is often cultivated for its ornamental value in greenhouses and botanical gardens."
