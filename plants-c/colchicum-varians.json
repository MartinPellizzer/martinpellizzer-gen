    "intro": "Colchicum varians, commonly known as the variable colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Colchicaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces a bulbous corm, which serves as its storage organ and allows it to survive in harsh conditions. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and appear after the flowers have bloomed. Colchicum varians is noted for its ability to thrive in woodland and meadow environments, often in partial shade."
