It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland edges. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white flowers are arranged in a loose cluster and bloom in early spring. The species is characterized by its delicate appearance and preference for wet, calcareous soils."
