    "intro": "Ctenitis maritima, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking, blue-to-violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a rosette of narrow, silvery-green leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing along dunes and rocky shores. Ctenitis maritima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal ecosystems."
