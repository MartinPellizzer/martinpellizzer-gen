    "intro": "Combretum undulatum, commonly known as the wavy combretum, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive wavy or undulating leaf margins, which give it its common name. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often glossy and dark green in color. It produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Combretum undulatum is often found in coastal and sandy habitats, and it is adapted to tolerate salt spray and well-drained soils."
