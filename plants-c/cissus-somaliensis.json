    "intro": "Cissus somaliensis, commonly known as the Somali grape ivy, is a climbing plant native to the arid regions of the Horn of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and small, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers followed by edible berries that are often used in local cuisines. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in dry climates."
