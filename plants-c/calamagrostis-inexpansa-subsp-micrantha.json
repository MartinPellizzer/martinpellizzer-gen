    "intro": "Calamagrostis inexpansa subsp. micrantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. The plant produces inflorescences of spikelets that are typically arranged in panicles, giving it a delicate, grass-like appearance. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland restoration projects."
