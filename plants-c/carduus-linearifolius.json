    "intro": "Carduus linearifolius, commonly known as the slender thistle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by bracts that resemble leaves. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its prickly nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but also has historical uses in herbal medicine."
