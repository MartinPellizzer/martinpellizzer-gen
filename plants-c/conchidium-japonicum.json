    "intro": "Conchidium japonicum, commonly known as the Japanese conch shell fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to Japan. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiral-shaped fronds that resemble the coiled form of a conch shell, giving it its common name. The plant has a delicate, creeping growth habit and produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forest undergrowth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
