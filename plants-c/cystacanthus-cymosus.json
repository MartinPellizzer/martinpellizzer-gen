    "intro": "Cystacanthus cymosus, commonly known as the clustered bladderworts, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used for capturing prey. They are typically found in wetlands, ponds, and slow-moving streams where they can anchor themselves in the substrate. The leaves are often reduced to scale-like structures, while the stems are leafless and rootless. Cystacanthus cymosus plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling within aquatic ecosystems."
