    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 almii, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a sterile hybrid between Carex echinata and Carex lyngbyei, resulting in a unique combination of characteristics from both parents. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands, where it thrives in well-drained soil. Its foliage is grass-like, with narrow, erect leaves that form dense clumps, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, Carex \u00d7 almii is often used in ecological landscaping and wetland restoration projects."
