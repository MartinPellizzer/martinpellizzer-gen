    "intro": "Ceratophytum, commonly known as the horned fig or horned ice plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Aizoaceae. These succulent plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their fleshy, water-storing leaves and showy, often yellow or red flowers. They thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, making them well adapted to drought conditions. The leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration. Ceratophytum species are popular among succulent enthusiasts due to their unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
