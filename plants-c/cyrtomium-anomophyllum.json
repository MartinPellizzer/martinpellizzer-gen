It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Cyrtomium anomophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, foliage."
