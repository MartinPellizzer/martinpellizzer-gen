It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its adaptations to harsh environments include succulent stems for water storage and spines for protection against herbivores. Chilita pubispina is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
