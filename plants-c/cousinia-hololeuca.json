    "intro": "Cousinia hololeuca, commonly known as the whiteflower globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Cousinia hololeuca is adapted to extreme temperatures and is a hardy perennial species."
