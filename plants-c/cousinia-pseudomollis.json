    "intro": "Cousinia pseudomollis, commonly known as the slender cousinia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cousinia pseudomollis produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
