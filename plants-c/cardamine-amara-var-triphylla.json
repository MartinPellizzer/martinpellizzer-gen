    "intro": "Cardamine amara var. triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaf watercress, is a herbaceous perennial native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It features trifoliate leaves composed of three ovate to lanceolate leaflets, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in a raceme, typically blooming in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread along the edges of streams and wetlands. The species is valued for its peppery flavor and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
