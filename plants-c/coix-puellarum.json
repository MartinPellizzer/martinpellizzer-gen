It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Coix puellarum is often found in marshy areas, stream banks, and other moist environments where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various insects and wildlife."
