    "intro": "Crataegus phippsii, commonly known as Phipps hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often tart, and they serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it is often found in woodland edges and moist soils."
