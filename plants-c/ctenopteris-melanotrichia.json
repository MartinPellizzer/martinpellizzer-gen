    "intro": "Ctenopteris melanotrichia, commonly known as the black-haired sea fern, is a species of fern native to coastal areas of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine, black hairs, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in brackish or saltwater environments, making it well adapted to tidal zones and mangrove habitats. Its rhizomes grow horizontally along the substrate, anchoring the plant and facilitating the spread of its colonies. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that distinguishes it from other fern species."
