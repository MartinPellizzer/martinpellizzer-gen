    "intro": "Chamaefilix flavelifolia, commonly known as the pink-flowered rockrose, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of pink or white flowers during the spring and summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valued addition to drought-tolerant landscapes."
