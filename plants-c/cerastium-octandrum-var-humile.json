    "intro": "Cerastium octandrum var. humile, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, hairy, rounded leaves and produces clusters of white, five-petaled flowers in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and meadows. Its stems are prostrate, allowing it to spread along the ground, and it often forms dense mats. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions."
