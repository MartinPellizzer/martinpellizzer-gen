    "intro": "Calamagrostis langsdorfii var. lactea, commonly known as silver feather reed grass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its silvery-white to pale blue plumes that give it a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and pond edges. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that adds to its ornamental value. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
