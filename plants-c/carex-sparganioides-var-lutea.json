    "intro": "Carex sparganioides var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow flowering sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellowish-green to golden flower spikes in the summer. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils. The variety is distinguished by its vibrant, showy inflorescence compared to other Carex species."
