    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 landonii, commonly known as the Landon's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pink or white with a yellowish lip, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
