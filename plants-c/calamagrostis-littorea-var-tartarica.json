    "intro": "Calamagrostis littorea var. tartarica, commonly known as the coastal grass or silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-tomentose leaves and upright, tufted growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, often in areas subject to salt spray. Its ornamental value comes from its graceful appearance and ability to form dense clumps. It is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal soils."
