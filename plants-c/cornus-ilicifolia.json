    "intro": "Cornus ilicifolia, commonly known as common dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. The plant has opposite, elliptic leaves with a slightly serrated edge, and it often grows in woodland areas or along streambanks. It is valued for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Cornus ilicifolia is also known for its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
