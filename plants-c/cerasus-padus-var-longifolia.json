    "intro": "Cerasus padus var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved wild cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are longer than they are wide. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by edible, dark red to black berries in the summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or open areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
