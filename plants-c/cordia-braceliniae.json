    "intro": "Cordia braceliniae, commonly known as the Bornean cordia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
