    "intro": "Centaurea xanthocephala, commonly known as the goldenhead centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flower heads, which are composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open fields. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Centaurea xanthocephala is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens due to its vibrant color and compact growth habit."
