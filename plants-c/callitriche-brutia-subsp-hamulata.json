    "intro": "Callitriche brutia subsp. hamulata, commonly known as the slender water-starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. Its flowers are small and white, with four petals, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through its dense growth."
