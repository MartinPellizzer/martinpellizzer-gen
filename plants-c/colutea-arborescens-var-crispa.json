It features a robust root system and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided leaflets that give it a feathery appearance. The variety 'crispa' is distinguished by its curled leaf margins, adding to its ornamental appeal."
