    "intro": "Crepidium hahajimense, commonly known as the Hahajima orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Hahajima Islands in Japan. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, linear leaves and a single, slender flower spike. The plant produces a single, fragrant flower with a distinctive, intricate lip that is often adorned with purple or red markings. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique microclimate of its island habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
