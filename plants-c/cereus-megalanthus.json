    "intro": "Cereus megalanthus, commonly known as the giant night-blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night and emit a strong fragrance. These flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few hours before closing in the morning. The plant is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for dry climates."
