It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. The plant features slender, upright stems that are often tinged with red, and its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and slightly hairy. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late summer. The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
