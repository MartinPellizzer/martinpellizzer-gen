    "intro": "Calamophyllum teretiusculum, commonly known as the narrowleaf desert sage, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to hot, dry environments and has a deep root system to access groundwater. It is often found in rocky soils and plays a role in stabilizing desert ecosystems. Its aromatic foliage has been used traditionally by Native American communities for medicinal and ceremonial purposes."
