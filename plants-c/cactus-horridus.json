    "intro": "Cactus horridus, commonly known as the devil's head, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its spines serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores and also help reduce water loss through transpiration. Cactus horridus plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing food and shelter for various desert animals."
