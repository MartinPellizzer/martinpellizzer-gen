    "intro": "Cnicus callosus, commonly known as the rough sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are covered in small, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Cnicus callosus is often considered a weed but has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
