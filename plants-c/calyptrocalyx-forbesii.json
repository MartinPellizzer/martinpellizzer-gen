    "intro": "Calyptrocalyx forbesii, commonly known as the Forbes' calyptrocalyx, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its unique calyx structure, which remains tightly closed around the fruit even after maturity. It produces small, showy flowers with five petals and is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
