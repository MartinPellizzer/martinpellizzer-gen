    "intro": "Cummingia parvula, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a small, herbaceous annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers. It is adapted to thrive in hot, dry conditions with minimal water requirements. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and habitat restoration in desert ecosystems."
