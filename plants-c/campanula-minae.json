    "intro": "Campanula minae, commonly known as the Minae bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, which helps reduce water loss. Campanula minae is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
