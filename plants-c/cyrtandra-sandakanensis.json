    "intro": "Cyrtandra sandakanensis, commonly known as the Sandakan Cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats within lowland and hill dipterocarp forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
