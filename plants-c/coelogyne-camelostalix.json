    "intro": "Coelogyne camelostalix, commonly known as the purple-veined orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features showy, fragrant flowers with vivid purple and white coloration, often with intricate veining. The plant has a pseudobulb structure typical of many orchids, which helps it store water and nutrients. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Coelogyne camelostalix thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
