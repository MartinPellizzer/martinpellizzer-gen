    "intro": "Carex debilis var. typica, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist soils in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in partial to full shade and requires consistent moisture throughout the growing season. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological importance, it is often used in wetland restoration projects."
