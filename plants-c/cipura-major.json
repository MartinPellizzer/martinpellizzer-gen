    "intro": "Cipura major, commonly known as the giant cipura, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its roots are fibrous and help it anchor in moist, nutrient-rich soil. Cipura major is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
