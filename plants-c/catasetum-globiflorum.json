It is characterized by its unique, showy inflorescences that resemble small globes, with densely packed, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are pollinated by specific bee species, which have specialized structures to access the nectar. The genus Catasetum is known for its intricate pollination mechanisms, making Catasetum globiflorum a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
