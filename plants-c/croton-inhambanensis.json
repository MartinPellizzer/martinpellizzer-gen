    "intro": "Croton inhambanensis, commonly known as the Inhambane croton, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by orange or red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
