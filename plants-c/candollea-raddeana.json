It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, velvety green leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers, which can be pink or purple, bloom in clusters and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Candollea raddeana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
