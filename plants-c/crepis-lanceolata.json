It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in grassy areas and along roadsides. The plant produces yellow flowers with a distinctive, hairy involucre that resembles a hawk's beak. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture. Crepis lanceolata is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
