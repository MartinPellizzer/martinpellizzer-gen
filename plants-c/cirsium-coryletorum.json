    "intro": "Cirsium coryletorum, commonly known as the creeping thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lance-shaped leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Cirsium coryletorum is often found in disturbed areas and can spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation."
