    "intro": "Curatella, commonly known as the white bead tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It consists of approximately 100 species, predominantly native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia. Curatella species typically produce bright yellow or orange fruits that are capsule-like and contain numerous seeds. The genus is also notable for its ornamental value, with some species cultivated for their attractive foliage and unique fruit structures."
