    "intro": "Cleome viscosa var. viscosa, commonly known as sticky cleome, is an annual herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish to white flowers with five petals, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common weed in agricultural fields and disturbed areas. Due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production, it can become invasive in certain environments."
