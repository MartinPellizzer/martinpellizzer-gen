    "intro": "Chamaebatiaria glutinosa, commonly known as sticky willow, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a sticky resin. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, typical of wind-pollinated species. Its sticky secretions are a notable botanical feature, serving as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or streambanks."
