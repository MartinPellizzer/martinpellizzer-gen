    "intro": "Calamagrostis henriettae, commonly known as Henrietta's reedgrass, is a perennial grass native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland gardens."
