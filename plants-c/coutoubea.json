    "intro": "Coutoubea, commonly known as the Brazilian bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and includes several species that are often cultivated for their showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plants typically have evergreen or semi-evergreen foliage and are characterized by their compact, shrub-like growth habit. They thrive in well-drained, acidic soils and are often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Coutoubea species are valued in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to bloom throughout the year in suitable climates."
