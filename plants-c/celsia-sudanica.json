    "intro": "Celsia sudanica, commonly known as the Sudanese celsia, is a flowering plant native to the Sahel region of Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Its leaves are small, elliptical, and often covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss. Celsia sudanica plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various insects and small animals."
