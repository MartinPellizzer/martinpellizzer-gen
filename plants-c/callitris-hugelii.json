    "intro": "Callitris hugelii, commonly known as the Hugel's plum tree, is a species of coniferous tree native to Australia. It belongs to the family Cupressaceae and is characterized by its scale-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, and its bark is often fissured and rough in texture. This plant is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental features."
