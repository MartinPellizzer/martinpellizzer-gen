    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 whitelyanum, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium micranthum. It is characterized by its large, showy, pouch-like flower that is typically pink or purple in color. The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has thick, fleshy roots and broad, strap-like leaves that help it absorb nutrients from the soil. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
