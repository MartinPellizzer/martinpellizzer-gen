    "intro": "Crataegus luminosa, commonly known as the luminous hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its showy white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and have serrated edges, contributing to its ornamental value. Crataegus luminosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
