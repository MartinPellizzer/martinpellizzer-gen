    "intro": "Carex grypos var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf bulbous sedge, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features dense clusters of grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens or wetland habitats. Its low-growing habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes. It is also an important food source for various insects and wildlife."
