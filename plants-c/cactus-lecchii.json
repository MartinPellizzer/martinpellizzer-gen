    "intro": "Cactus lecchii, commonly known as the golden cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, spiny areoles, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warm season, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in dry environments. Cactus lecchii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
