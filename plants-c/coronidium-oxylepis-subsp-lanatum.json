    "intro": "Coronidium oxylepis subsp. lanatum, commonly known as the woolly coralroot, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll and reliance on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, making it a hemiparasitic plant. The subspecies lanatum is distinguished by its dense, woolly covering of fine hairs on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and it thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
