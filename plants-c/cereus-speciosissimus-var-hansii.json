It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its thick, segmented stems that bear clusters of vibrant, tubular flowers. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular houseplant due to its long blooming period, often extending from late autumn through winter. Its unique appearance and seasonal flowering make it a favored choice for holiday displays."
