    "intro": "Cereus chiloensis var. fulvibarbis, commonly known as the yellow-tipped cholla, is a succulent cactus native to Chile. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that branch into clusters of spiny, cylindrical segments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements. The varietal name 'fulvibarbis' refers to the yellowish color of its bracts."
