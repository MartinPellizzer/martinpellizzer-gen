    "intro": "Cerasus recta, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or yuzen-zakura, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its ornamental value, particularly during spring when it produces clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant has elliptic to ovate leaves that are dark green and often have a slightly hairy texture. Its fruit is a small, tart cherry that is edible but less commonly consumed compared to other cherry species. Cerasus recta is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and parks due to its aesthetic appeal and seasonal blooms."
