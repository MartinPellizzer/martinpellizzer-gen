It is a low-growing annual herb that features fleshy, succulent leaves and stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. Its scientific name reflects its delicate appearance, with \"nitida\" meaning shiny or smooth. Calandrinia nitida is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid environments."
