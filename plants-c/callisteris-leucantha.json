    "intro": "Callisteris leucantha, commonly known as the white-tasseled broom, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces cylindrical seed pods that contain numerous small, round seeds, typical of many leguminous species. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Its structure and growth habits make it well adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
