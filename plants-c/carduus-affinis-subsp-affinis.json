    "intro": "Carduus affinis subsp. affinis, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and basal rosette of leaves, which are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Botanically, it is notable for its extensive root system and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction."
