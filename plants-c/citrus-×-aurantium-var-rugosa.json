    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 aurantium var. rugosa, commonly known as the rough lemon, is a hybrid citrus plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, rough, and pebbled rind, which distinguishes it from other citrus varieties. The leaves are dark green and oval-shaped, with a slightly serrated margin. The fruit is typically small, yellow when ripe, and has a high acidity level, making it less suitable for fresh consumption but valued in culinary and medicinal applications. It is often used as a rootstock in citrus cultivation due to its hardiness and disease resistance."
