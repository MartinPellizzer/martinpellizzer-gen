    "intro": "Caraipa tereticaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved caraipa, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
