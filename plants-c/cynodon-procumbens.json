    "intro": "Cynodon procumbens, commonly known as Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit and fine, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is highly resilient, capable of surviving in a variety of soil types and climatic conditions. Due to its aggressive growth, it is often used for erosion control and as a lawn grass."
