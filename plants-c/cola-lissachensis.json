It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, with smooth, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into capsules containing the characteristic cola nuts. These nuts are rich in caffeine and are used in the production of cola beverages and traditional medicines. Its botanical features make it an important plant in both ecological and economic contexts in its native habitat."
