    "intro": "Calanthe otuhanica, commonly known as the Oahu calanthe, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Hawaiian island of Oahu. It is a terrestrial herb with a pseudobulbous structure, featuring a short, thick stem that stores water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
