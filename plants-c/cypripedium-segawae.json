    "intro": "Cypripedium segawae, commonly known as the Segawa's lady's slipper, is a rare and endangered orchid native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy pink and white flower with a pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest floors and thrives in cool, humid climates. Its leaves are broad and leathery, and it produces a single flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
