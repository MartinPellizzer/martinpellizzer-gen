    "intro": "Cypripedium henryi, commonly known as the Henry's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy, slipper-shaped flower that is typically pink or reddish in color. The plant has a thick, fleshy rhizome and produces a single, prominent lip that is often adorned with intricate patterns. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
