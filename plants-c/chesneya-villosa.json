    "intro": "Chesneya villosa, commonly known as the woolly chesney, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features soft, hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its showy, yellow-orange flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Chesneya villosa is often found in sandy or rocky soils along the edges of woodlands and open areas."
