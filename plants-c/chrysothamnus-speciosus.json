    "intro": "Chrysothamnus speciosus, commonly known as the yellow rabbitbrush, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and silver-green foliage, which are adapted to arid environments. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in dry, sandy soils. It produces small, oval leaves that are covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss. Yellow rabbitbrush is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
