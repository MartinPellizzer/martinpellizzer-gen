    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris subcanescens, commonly known as the common chickweed or mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that bear small, alternate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, cruciform flowers that are typically arranged in a raceme. Its fruits are short, cylindrical pods that dehisce to release seeds, a common reproductive strategy in the Brassicaceae family. This species is often found in disturbed soils, lawns, and along pathways, thriving in temperate climates."
