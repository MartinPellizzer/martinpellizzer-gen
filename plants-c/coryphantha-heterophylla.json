    "intro": "Coryphantha heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf coryphantha, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that often branch at the base, and its leaves, which are typically reduced to spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green or blue-green stems. Coryphantha heterophylla is adapted to arid environments, with a shallow root system that allows it to efficiently absorb rainwater. Its unique leaf variation, where leaves can be either scale-like or leaf-like depending on environmental conditions, makes it an interesting subject for botanical study."
