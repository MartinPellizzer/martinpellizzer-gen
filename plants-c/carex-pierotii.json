It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, consist of small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated. Carex pierotii plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
