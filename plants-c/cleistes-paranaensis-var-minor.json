    "intro": "Cleistes paranaensis var. minor, commonly known as the lesser parana orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the dense canopy of the forest. Its leaves are oval-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture. Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered a vulnerable species."
