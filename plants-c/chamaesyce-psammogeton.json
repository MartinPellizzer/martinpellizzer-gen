    "intro": "Chamaesyce psammogeton, commonly known as sand spurge, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and sandy environments. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and distinctive, milky sap. The plant typically thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in coastal dunes, roadsides, and other dry habitats. Its flowers are inconspicuous, consisting of a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which houses the reproductive parts. Due to its hardy nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural areas."
