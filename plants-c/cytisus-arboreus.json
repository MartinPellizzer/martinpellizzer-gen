It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Cytisus arboreus is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
