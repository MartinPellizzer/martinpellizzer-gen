    "intro": "Cerastium wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and dense clusters of small, white flowers. The plant features hairy, oval-shaped leaves and produces tiny, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in rocky or alpine environments and is often found in open, sunny areas at high elevations. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
