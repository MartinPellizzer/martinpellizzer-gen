    "intro": "Cephalomanes obscurum, commonly known as the dark-headed mite, is a species of mite belonging to the family Erythraeidae. It is characterized by its small, oval body and a dark, almost black head region, which gives it its common name. This species is typically found in moist environments, such as under leaf litter or in soil, where it plays a role in decomposition. Its life cycle includes several stages, with the adult female being the most commonly observed. Due to its cryptic nature and limited study, much about its ecological role and distribution remains unknown."
