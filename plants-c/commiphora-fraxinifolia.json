    "intro": "Commiphora fraxinifolia, commonly known as the Indian gum tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the tropical regions of Africa and southern Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in terminal panicles. The plant is known for secreting a resinous gum from its bark, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open woodlands or scrub habitats. Commiphora fraxinifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
