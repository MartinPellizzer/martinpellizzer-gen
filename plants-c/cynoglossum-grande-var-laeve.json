    "intro": "Cynoglossum grande var. laeve, commonly known as the broadleaf forget-me-not, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal rosettes of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and have a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
