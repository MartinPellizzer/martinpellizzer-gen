    "intro": "Convolvulus fruticulosus var. glabrior, commonly known as the smoothleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a trailing perennial that produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. The leaves are typically smooth and lobed, and the stems are hairy but less so than the typical variety. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
