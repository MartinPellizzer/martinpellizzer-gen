    "intro": "Cuscuta flossdorfii, commonly known as the Flossdorf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host plant. The plant is native to regions of Central and South America and is often found growing on grasses and shrubs. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it can form dense infestations on its host, potentially weakening or killing it. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its habitat."
