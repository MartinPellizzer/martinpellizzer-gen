    "intro": "Centaurea discoidea, commonly known as the disk-centered centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. Its bright yellow to orange flowers are surrounded by a dense cluster of smaller florets, creating a distinctive disk-like appearance. Centaurea discoidea is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
