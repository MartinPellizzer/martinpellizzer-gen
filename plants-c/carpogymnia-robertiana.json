    "intro": "Carpogymnia robertiana, commonly known as the Robertian clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lepidoziaceae. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that produce small, scale-like leaves. The plant forms dense mats on the forest floor, often in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, called microsporangia, are clustered in small, rounded clusters called strobila. Carpogymnia robertiana is a primitive vascular plant with a unique morphology that reflects its ancient evolutionary lineage."
