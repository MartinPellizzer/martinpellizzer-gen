    "intro": "Cervaria rivini var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf cervaria, is a variant of the species Cervaria rivini, belonging to the family Cupulofloraceae. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, cup-shaped flowers that are often green or reddish in color, which develop into fleshy, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This variant is notable for its adaptability to wet soil conditions and its role in local ecosystems."
