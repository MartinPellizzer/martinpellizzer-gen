    "intro": "Cardamine impatiens var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. It features delicate, alternate leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, with a lanceolate shape and a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its root system consists of a short, thick rhizome that supports the growth of its fibrous roots. This variety is closely related to other members of the Ranunculaceae family, sharing similar botanical characteristics and ecological preferences."
