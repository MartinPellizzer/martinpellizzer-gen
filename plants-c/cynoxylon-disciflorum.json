    "intro": "Cynoxylon disciflorum, commonly known as the African sandthorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The plant is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh, dry conditions."
