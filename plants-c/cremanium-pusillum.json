    "intro": "Cremanium pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf cremanium, is a small, delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy surface, and its flowers range in color from white to pale pink. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Cremanium pusillum is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
