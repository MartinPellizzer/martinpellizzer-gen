    "intro": "Carex lasiocarpa, commonly known as the soft-haired sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and stream banks. Carex lasiocarpa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
