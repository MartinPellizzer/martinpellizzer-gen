    "intro": "Carex ferruginea var. firma, commonly known as the redstem sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are usually dark green with a reddish tinge on the underside, and it produces small, clustered brownish flowers in late summer. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
