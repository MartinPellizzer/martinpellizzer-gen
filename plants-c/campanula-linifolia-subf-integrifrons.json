    "intro": "Campanula linifolia subf. integrifrons, commonly known as the broad-leaf bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are broad, ovate, and often have a slightly rough texture. This species prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its showy flowers and relatively low maintenance requirements."
