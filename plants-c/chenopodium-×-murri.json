    "intro": "Chenopodium \u00d7 murri, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, bluish-green leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically appear in late summer. The plant is adapted to hot, dry climates and has a shallow, fibrous root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. Its leaves are often used as forage for livestock, and it is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The species is a hybrid between Chenopodium album and Chenopodium berlandieri, showcasing genetic diversity within the Chenopodium genus."
