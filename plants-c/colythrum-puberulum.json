    "intro": "Colythrum puberulum, commonly known as the hairy bladder campion, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its small, pink to purple flowers and hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine tundra habitats. Its leaves are opposite and oblong, with a rough texture, while its flowers are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Colythrum puberulum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates."
