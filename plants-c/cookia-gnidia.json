    "intro": "Cookia gnidia, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey-green bark and small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer, followed by orange-red fruits containing sticky, milky sap. Cookia gnidia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
