    "intro": "Cerastium argenteum, commonly known as silver weed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has hairy, silver-gray leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, disturbed areas, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil."
