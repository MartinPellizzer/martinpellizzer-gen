It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces delicate white or pale pink flowers with three petals. It is part of the family Ranunculaceae, which includes other well-known flowering plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
