    "intro": "Crotalaria noldeae, commonly known as the Nolde's crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its legume-like pods and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in open woodland or savanna habitats. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with distinctive spurred petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The seeds are enclosed in a hard pod, which splits open when mature to release the seeds."
