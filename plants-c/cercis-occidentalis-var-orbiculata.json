    "intro": "Cercis occidentalis var. orbiculata, commonly known as the Western redbud, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, flat pods that contain edible seeds, which are typically dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its compact size and seasonal color changes make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
