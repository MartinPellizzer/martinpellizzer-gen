    "intro": "Cupressus leptoclada, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cypress, is a species of coniferous evergreen tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves that are dark green and closely pressed together. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for ornamental gardening. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and drought tolerance."
