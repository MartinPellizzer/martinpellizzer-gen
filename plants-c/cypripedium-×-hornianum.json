    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 hornianum, commonly known as the horned lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, pouch-like flower that resembles a slipper, typically ranging in color from yellow to deep red. The plant has a pseudobulb structure and produces a single, showy flower per stem, which blooms in late spring or early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade and requires well-drained, humus-rich soil. Due to its ornamental value and rarity in the wild, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
