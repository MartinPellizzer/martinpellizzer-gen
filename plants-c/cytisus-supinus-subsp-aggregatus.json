It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
