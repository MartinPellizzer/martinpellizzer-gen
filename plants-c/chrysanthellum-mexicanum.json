    "intro": "Chrysanthellum mexicanum, commonly known as the Mexican chrysanthemum, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces showy yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not as widely grown as other chrysanthemum species."
