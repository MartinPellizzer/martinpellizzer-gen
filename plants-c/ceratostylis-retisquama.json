    "intro": "Ceratostylis retisquama, commonly known as the netted spathephyllum, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, showy inflorescence that bears small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy coating, which helps in water retention. The orchid's unique floral structure and adaptability to humid environments make it a notable species in botanical studies."
