    "intro": "Cereus kreggii, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, a trait that aids in pollination by nocturnal insects. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to drought conditions. The flowers are often short-lived, lasting only a single night, which adds to the plant's allure."
