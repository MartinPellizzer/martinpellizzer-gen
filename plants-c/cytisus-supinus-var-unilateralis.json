    "intro": "Cytisus supinus var. unilateralis, commonly known as the single-flowered Scotch broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its dense, yellow-orange flowers that are typically clustered in groups of three, though the variety name \"unilateralis\" suggests a unique floral arrangement. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal and rocky environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
