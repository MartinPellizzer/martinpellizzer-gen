    "intro": "Calanthe dulongensis, commonly known as the Dulong's calanthe, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, spurred flowers. The plant typically features lanceolate leaves and blooms in shades of white to pale pink, often with a distinctive lip. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calanthe dulongensis is considered a conservation concern."
