    "intro": "Cattleya warscewiczii, commonly known as the Brazilian orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Brazil. It is a sympodial orchid with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, often with a distinctive yellow lip. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its botanical features make it both a valuable ornamental plant and an important subject in orchid research."
