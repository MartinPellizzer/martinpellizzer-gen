    "intro": "Cochlearia sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessileleaf scurvygrass, is a low-growing annual plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically has basal leaves that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, rounded pods that contain several seeds. Cochlearia sessilifolia is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in rocky and sandy soils with cool, moist conditions."
