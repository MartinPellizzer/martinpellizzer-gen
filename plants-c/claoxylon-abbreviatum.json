    "intro": "Claoxylon abbreviatum, commonly known as the dwarf sycamore, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It has smooth, pale grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and its leaves are elliptical with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in tropical gardens."
