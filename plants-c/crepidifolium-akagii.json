    "intro": "Crepidifolium akagii, commonly known as the Japanese crepe fern, is a species of fern native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are divided into small, overlapping segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients. The foliage is often used in traditional Japanese gardens for its ornamental value and aesthetic appeal."
