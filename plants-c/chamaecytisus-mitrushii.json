    "intro": "Chamaecytisus mitrushii, commonly known as the Mitru\u0161i broom, is a shrub native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has leathery, evergreen leaves that help it retain moisture in its native, often arid environment. It is typically found in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to full sun. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
