    "intro": "Cassia eglandulosa, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping inflorescences that bear clusters of bright yellow, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. Cassia eglandulosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
