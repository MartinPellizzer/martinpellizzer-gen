    "intro": "Comandra obtusifolia, commonly known as the woolly goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woolly gray foliage and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert and sagebrush habitats. It has a creeping growth habit with branched stems that root at the nodes. Comandra obtusifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance."
