    "intro": "Chrysosplenium calcitrapa, commonly known as the limestone spleenwort, is a small, evergreen perennial herb belonging to the Saxifragaceae family. It is native to rocky, calcareous habitats in Europe and Asia, often found in mountainous regions. The plant features succulent, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in clusters, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a rare and sensitive indicator of limestone-rich environments."
