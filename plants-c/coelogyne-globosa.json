    "intro": "Coelogyne globosa, commonly known as the globe orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically blooms during the dry season, with its showy inflorescences often lasting several weeks. Its leaves are strap-shaped and arranged in a rosette, and it thrives in bright, indirect light with high humidity. Coelogyne globosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is relatively easy to cultivate with proper care."
