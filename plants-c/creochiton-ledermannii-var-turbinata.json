    "intro": "Creochiton ledermannii var. turbinata, commonly known as the Turbinated Flatbacked Millipede, is a species of millipede belonging to the order Polydesmida. It is characterized by its elongated, segmented body covered in a hard exoskeleton, which provides protection against predators. The species exhibits a distinct coloration, often ranging from dark brown to reddish-brown, with a slightly curved dorsal plate. It is typically found in moist, forested environments, where it feeds on decaying plant matter and fungi. This variant is notable for its relatively flat body and the presence of a unique, turbinate (turbulent) shape in its terminal segments."
