    "intro": "Cyperus rotundus var. disruptus, commonly known as purple flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides, fields, and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow, flat, and typically have a reddish or purplish hue, which gives it its common name. It is considered an invasive species in many areas due to its rapid spread and ability to thrive in various environmental conditions."
