    "intro": "Carex panicea f. ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a rusty or reddish hue, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
