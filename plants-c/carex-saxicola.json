It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in high-altitude or cold environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in a cylindrical inflorescence.
