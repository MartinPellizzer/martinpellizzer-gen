    "intro": "Corymbia serendipita, commonly known as the red blood gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale to reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically pink to red in color, which bloom during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are lance-shaped, glossy, and have a dark green upper surface with a lighter underside. Corymbia serendipita is often found in coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in supporting local wildlife."
