    "intro": "Cyclosorus gladiatus, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its sword-shaped, erect fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. Its simple, dichotomous branching pattern is a distinctive botanical feature."
