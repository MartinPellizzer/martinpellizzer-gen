    "intro": "Caralluma punctata, commonly known as the spineless nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming at night. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Caralluma punctata is also valued as a low-maintenance ornamental plant in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance."
