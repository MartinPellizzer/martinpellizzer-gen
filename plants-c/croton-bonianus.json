It features striking, variegated leaves that range from bright green to yellow and red, making it a popular ornamental plant. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care, it is a favored choice for indoor gardening."
