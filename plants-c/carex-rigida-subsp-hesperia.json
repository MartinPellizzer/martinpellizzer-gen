    "intro": "Carex rigida subsp. hesperia, commonly known as the Pacific sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swales, and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
