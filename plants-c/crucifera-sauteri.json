    "intro": "Crucifera sauteri, commonly known as the Sauter's mustard, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous species. It is characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain several seeds, a common feature among members of its family. It is native to certain regions of Europe and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a wild relative of cultivated mustard crops."
