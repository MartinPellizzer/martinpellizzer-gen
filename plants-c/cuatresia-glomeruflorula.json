    "intro": "Cuatresia glomeruflorula, commonly known as the clustered-flowered cuatresia, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant has palmate leaves with a velvety texture and emits a mild, sweet fragrance during the evening. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by nocturnal moths and bats, which are attracted to its strong scent and abundant nectar. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cuatresia glomeruflorula is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
