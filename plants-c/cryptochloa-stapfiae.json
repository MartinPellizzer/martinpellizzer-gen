    "intro": "Cryptochloa stapfiae, commonly known as the Stapf's cryptochloa, is a rare grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often hidden within the foliage. Cryptochloa stapfiae is adapted to cool, moist environments and thrives in rocky or clayey soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
