    "intro": "Cynosurus sphaerocephalus, commonly known as the globe-headed fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its compact, spherical seed heads that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Cynosurus sphaerocephalus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
