    "intro": "Centaurea lusitanica var. crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaved cornflower, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and large, showy blue to purple flowers. The leaves are broad and thick, often with a rough texture, which helps it retain moisture in dry environments. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
