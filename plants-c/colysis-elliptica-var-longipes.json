    "intro": "Colysis elliptica var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed elliptic colysis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Asia. It features lanceolate to elliptic leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in umbel-like clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its botanical interest lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
