    "intro": "Colletia infausta, commonly known as the desert candelabra, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its branching, columnar stems that often form a bush-like structure. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in its harsh environment. Colletia infausta is adapted to extreme drought conditions and can survive with minimal rainfall."
