It features long, grass-like leaves that are narrow and slightly curled at the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and indirect sunlight, making it ideal for indoor cultivation. Its ability to propagate easily through offsets makes it a popular choice for gardeners and plant enthusiasts."
