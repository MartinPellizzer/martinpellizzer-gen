    "intro": "Cerastium falcatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, kidney-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are typically arranged in umbels. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens and restoration projects."
