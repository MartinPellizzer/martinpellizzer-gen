    "intro": "Cercis nephrophylla, commonly known as the Sierra Madre maple, is a small deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its palmate leaves that are typically lobed and have a distinctive maple-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale pink to red flowers in the spring, which are followed by winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. The Sierra Madre maple is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native range."
