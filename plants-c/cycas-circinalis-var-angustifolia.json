    "intro": "Cycas circinalis var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycas, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnately compound leaves that are narrow and strap-like. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically appearing on separate plants. It is a slow-growing, long-lived plant that thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. Due to its ancient lineage and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
