    "intro": "Cyperus glaber f. contractus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a variant of the broadleaf sedges characterized by its narrower leaves. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along water bodies. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. The leaves are linear and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat."
