    "intro": "Chenopodium pygmaeum, commonly known as dwarf goosefoot, is a small, herbaceous annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in compact clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Chenopodium pygmaeum is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can often be found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine and is also considered a potential forage plant for wildlife."
