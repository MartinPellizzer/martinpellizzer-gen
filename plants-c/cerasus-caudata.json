    "intro": "Cerasus caudata, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or sakura, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often preceding the emergence of leaves. The plant produces small, bright red or yellow berries that are edible but not widely cultivated for consumption. Its ornamental value lies in its showy blossoms, making it a popular choice in gardens and landscapes. Cerasus caudata thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil with partial to full sunlight."
