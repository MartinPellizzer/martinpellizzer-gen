    "intro": "Corylus tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan hazelnut, is a species of hazelnut native to the Tibetan Plateau. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in high-altitude regions with cold climates. The plant produces small, oval-shaped nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, which mature in the autumn. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated edge, often turning yellow in the fall. Corylus tibetica plays an important role in its native ecosystem, providing food for various wildlife species."
