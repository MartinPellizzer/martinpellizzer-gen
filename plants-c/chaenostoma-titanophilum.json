    "intro": "Chaenostoma titanophilum, commonly known as the giant water starwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater ecosystems of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter, supporting a dense network of fine, branching roots. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving waters with abundant sunlight, often found in marshy areas and pond margins. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters near the water's surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
