    "intro": "Cyperus curvulus, commonly known as the narrowleaf paperplant, is a flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often forming dense stands in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. Its slender, grass-like leaves are arranged in a tight spiral, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Cyperus curvulus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
