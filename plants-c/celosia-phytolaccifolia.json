It features striking, feather-like bracts that range in color from red to orange, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated for its vibrant foliage rather than its flowers."
