    "intro": "Cereus areolatus, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a flowering cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a unique structure, with a colorful \"upper\" portion that is actually a graft of a different cactus species. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. It requires minimal water and full sun to thrive, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
