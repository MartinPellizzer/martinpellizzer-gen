    "intro": "Centropogon carolinae, commonly known as the Carolina panic grass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it blend into its natural habitat. Centropogon carolinae is often found in sandy or disturbed soils, thriving in open, sunny environments."
