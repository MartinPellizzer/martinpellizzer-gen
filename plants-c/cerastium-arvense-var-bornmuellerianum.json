    "intro": "Cerastium arvense var. bornmuellerianum, commonly known as the slender mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, rounded leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, five-petaled flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for garden use in moist, partially shaded areas."
