    "intro": "Cyclosorus mindanaensis, commonly known as the Mindanao cyclosorus, is a rare fern species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its unique fronds with a distinct, often recurved shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountain forests and rocky areas. Its reproductive structures are well-developed, with sori arranged in a circular pattern on the undersides of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
