It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. The leaves are usually alternate, with a rough, hairy texture and a distinctive lobed shape."
