It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically silver-white underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
