    "intro": "Cystopteris fragilis var. azorica, commonly known as the Azorean brittle fern, is a variant of the brittle fern native to the Azores. It is a small, delicate fern characterized by its finely divided, bi- or tri-pinnate fronds that are typically light green and slightly curled. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the fern family. This variety is notable for its fragility and unique adaptations to its island habitat."
