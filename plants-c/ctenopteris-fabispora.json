    "intro": "Ctenopteris fabispora, commonly known as the Borneo water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used in ornamental water gardens. The plant has a complex rhizome system that helps it anchor in shallow water and absorb nutrients. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Ctenopteris fabispora thrives in warm, humid environments with clear, still water."
