    "intro": "Chenopodium capitatum, commonly known as tumbleweed, is a flowering plant in the Amaranthaceae family. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a dense cluster at the tip of the stem. The plant is known for its ability to produce a large, dry, wind-dispersed seed head that easily detaches and rolls across the ground. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and extensive seed dispersal make it an important component of desert ecosystems."
