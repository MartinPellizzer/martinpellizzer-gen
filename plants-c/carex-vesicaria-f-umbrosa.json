    "intro": "Carex vesicaria f. umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
