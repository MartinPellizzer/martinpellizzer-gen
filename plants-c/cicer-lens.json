    "intro": "Cicer lens, commonly known as chickpeas, is a leguminous plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its bushy growth habit and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being oval and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain one to three angular seeds, which are the edible part. Chickpeas are well adapted to dry climates and are known for their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. They are an important crop in many regions, valued for their nutritional content and versatility in culinary uses."
