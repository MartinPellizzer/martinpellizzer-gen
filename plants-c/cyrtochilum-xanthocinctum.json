    "intro": "Cyrtochilum xanthocinctum, commonly known as the golden-streaked orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, hairy rhizomes and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with distinctive orange markings, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-drained, humus-rich soil. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
