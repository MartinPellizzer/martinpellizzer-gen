    "intro": "Cereus multiplex, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and is often cultivated for its striking, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for desert and xerophytic conditions. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink and can reach several inches in diameter. The species is also known for its ability to store water in its thick stems, a key adaptation to its natural habitat."
