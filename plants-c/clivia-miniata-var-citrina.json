It is characterized by its upright, strap-like leaves that are a vibrant green, often with a slight yellowish tinge. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are highly attractive to pollinators. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor cultivation. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
