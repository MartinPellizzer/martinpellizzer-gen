    "intro": "Ceratococca, commonly known as the horned cup, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Capparaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like structures on the fruits, which give the plant its common name. The leaves are typically alternate and pinnately lobed, with a rough or hairy texture. Ceratococca species are often found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. These plants are adapted to withstand drought and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
