    "intro": "Canscora lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cantharid, is a perennial herb native to the tropical regions of South America. It features a creeping rhizomatous stem system that allows it to spread across the ground. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Canscora lancifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
