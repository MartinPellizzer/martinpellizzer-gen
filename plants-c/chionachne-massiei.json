    "intro": "Chionachne massiei, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early summer. Due to its adaptability to harsh conditions, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions."
