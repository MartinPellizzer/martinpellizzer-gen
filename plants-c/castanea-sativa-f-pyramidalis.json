    "intro": "Castanea sativa f. pyramidalis, commonly known as the columnar horse chestnut. This cultivar is characterized by its narrow, upright growth habit, making it an ideal choice for vertical spaces. It features large, palmate leaves that turn yellow in autumn, adding ornamental value. The plant produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers in spring, followed by spiny, capsule-like fruits. It is relatively hardy and thrives in full sun, though it prefers well-drained soil."
