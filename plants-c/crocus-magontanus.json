    "intro": "Crocus magontanus, commonly known as the Magontan crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Iris family (Iridaceae) and is characterized by its early blooming habit, often flowering in late winter or early spring. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, with six petals that are typically adorned with a central blotch. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from a basal rosette of foliage. Crocus magontanus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils."
