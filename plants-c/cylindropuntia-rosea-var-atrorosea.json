    "intro": "Cylindropuntia rosea var. atrorosea, commonly known as the black rose cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, spine-covered stems that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces vibrant pink to red flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The varietal name \"atrorosea\" refers to its dark rose-colored flowers, distinguishing it from other varieties of the species."
