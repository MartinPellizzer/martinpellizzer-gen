    "intro": "Curarea iquitana, commonly known as the Amazonian arrow poison plant, is a climbing shrub native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, green stems and alternate leaves. The plant is most notable for containing curare, a potent neurotoxin used historically by indigenous peoples for hunting. Its roots and stems are typically harvested and processed to extract the toxic alkaloids. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a dangerous plant both in traditional use and in modern botanical studies."
