    "intro": "Caladenia aestiva, commonly known as the Morning Glory Orchid, is a striking orchid species native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in heathlands and open forests, preferring well-drained soils and sunny to partially shaded conditions. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear clusters of vibrant pink to purple flowers, which open in the early morning. Its flowers have a distinctive spurred labellum and are pollinated primarily by birds and insects. Caladenia aestiva is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
