    "intro": "Coccothrinax crinita subsp. brevicrinis, commonly known as the short-bristled palm, is a compact, cold-tolerant palm native to the Caribbean. It features a slender trunk with a crown of narrow, feather-like leaves that are slightly curled at the tips. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by clustered, edible fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Due to its resilience, it is a popular choice for coastal and tropical gardens."
