    "intro": "Campanula tatrae subsp. mentiens, commonly known as the Tatra bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the Tatra Mountains of Central Europe. It is characterized by its bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. Campanula tatrae subsp. mentiens plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is a symbol of the unique biodiversity of the Tatra region."
