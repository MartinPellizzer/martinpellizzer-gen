    "intro": "Chlorospatha antioquiensis, commonly known as the Antioquian green fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Antioquia, Colombia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered along the leaf margins. Its growth habit is primarily epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without being parasitic. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chlorospatha antioquiensis is considered a conservation concern."
