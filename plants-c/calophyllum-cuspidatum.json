    "intro": "Calophyllum cuspidatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved white ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Calophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood and elliptical leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are followed by orange-red fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its hard wood, it has been historically used for construction and tool-making."
