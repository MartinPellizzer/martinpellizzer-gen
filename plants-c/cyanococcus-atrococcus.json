    "intro": "Cyanococcus atrococcus, commonly known as the black sand plant, is a halophytic species belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its dark green to nearly black foliage, which gives it its common name. This plant thrives in saline and arid environments, often found in coastal regions and salt marshes. Its small, grass-like leaves are adapted to retain moisture in harsh conditions. Cyanococcus atrococcus plays a role in stabilizing soil in saline areas and is sometimes used in phytoremediation efforts."
