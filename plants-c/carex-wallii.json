    "intro": "Carex wallii, commonly known as Wall's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to eastern Asia, including regions of China, Japan, and Korea. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of flowers that are typically green or brown in color. Carex wallii thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a valuable plant for erosion control and habitat creation."
