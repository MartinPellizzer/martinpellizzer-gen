It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of blue or violet. The leaves are lanceolate, which gives the plant its specific epithet, and they are often hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often grown in gardens for its delicate, showy blooms. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile choice for rock gardens and borders."
