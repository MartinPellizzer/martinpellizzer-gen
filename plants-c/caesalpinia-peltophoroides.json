    "intro": "Caesalpinia peltophoroides, commonly known as the yellow flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its bright yellow, flame-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces long, slender pods that contain flat, seed-like structures. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. The species is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
