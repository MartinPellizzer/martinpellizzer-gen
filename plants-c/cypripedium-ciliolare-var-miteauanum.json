    "intro": "Cypripedium ciliolare var. miteauanum, commonly known as the Miteauan lady's slipper, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, slipper-shaped flower with a deep pink or red pouch and intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, relying on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single, showy flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this variant is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
