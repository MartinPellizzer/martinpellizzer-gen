    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris perfoliosa, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and a distinctive seed pod that resembles a heart-shaped bur. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, lawns, and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it both a weed and a useful plant for soil stabilization."
