    "intro": "Cousinia lignosissima, commonly known as the hardstem globemallow, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Cousinia lignosissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
