    "intro": "Cyclosorus varians, commonly known as the variable cyclosorus, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor the plant while spreading vegetatively. The spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
