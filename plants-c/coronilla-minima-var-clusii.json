    "intro": "Coronilla minima var. clusii, commonly known as the dwarf crown vetch, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, trifoliate leaves and produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
