    "intro": "Caladenia longicauda subsp. redacta, commonly known as the red-tailed spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It features a single, slender stem with a single, elongated leaf that is often reddish in color. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive red tail-like spur at the base of the lip. It blooms during late winter to early spring, typically between June and August. This subspecies is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism involving myrmecophiles, or ant-associated insects."
