It is a herbaceous annual that produces trumpet-shaped flowers, typically in shades of pink, purple, or white. The plant has a trailing growth habit and is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The flowers bloom in the morning, hence its common name, and are pollinated by bees and other insects."
