    "intro": "Cattleya mossiae var. mooreana, commonly known as the Moore's Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, white, and purple. The plant produces thick, fleshy roots and prefers warm, humid environments with bright indirect light. It is a sympodial orchid, meaning it grows in a horizontal pattern with new growths emerging from the base of the old pseudobulbs. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
