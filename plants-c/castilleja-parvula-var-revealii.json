    "intro": "Castilleja parvula var. revealii, commonly known as the smallleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures, relying on host plants for water and nutrients. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its unique appearance and parasitic nature make it an interesting subject in ecological studies."
