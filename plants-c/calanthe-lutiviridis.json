    "intro": "Calanthe lutiviridis, commonly known as the green marsh calanthe, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system helps it anchor in moist soil and absorb nutrients. Calanthe lutiviridis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
