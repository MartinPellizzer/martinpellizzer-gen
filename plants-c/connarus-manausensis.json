    "intro": "Connarus manausensis, commonly known as the Manaus connarus, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and dense foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries. It is often found in moist, shaded environments along riverbanks and in secondary forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
