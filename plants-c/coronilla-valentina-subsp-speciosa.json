    "intro": "Coronilla valentina subsp. speciosa, commonly known as the showy crownvetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces showy, violet-blue flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for dry environments. Its ability to fix nitrogen through root nodules makes it beneficial for soil enrichment. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
