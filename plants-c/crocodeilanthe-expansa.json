    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe expansa, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach several feet in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a lush appearance throughout the year."
