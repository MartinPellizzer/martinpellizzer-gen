    "intro": "Coronanthera grandis, commonly known as the giant coronanthera, is a striking orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces strikingly colored, waxy petals that range from white to pink, often with a contrasting lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
