    "intro": "Cephalophyllum luxurians, commonly known as the crown of thorns, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem covered in small, spiny tubercles that protect it from herbivores. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its stem to survive in dry conditions. Cephalophyllum luxurians is well adapted to harsh environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
