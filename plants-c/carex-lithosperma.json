    "intro": "Carex lithosperma, commonly known as stonecrop sedge. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. The plant has grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes, which are usually greenish or brownish. Carex lithosperma is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
