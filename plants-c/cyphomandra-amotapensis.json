    "intro": "Cyphomandra amotapensis, commonly known as the Peruvian nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in the evening. Its fruits are edible but have a bitter taste and contain solanine, making them potentially toxic if consumed in large quantities. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and night-blooming habit."
