It features striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from August to September. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and its bulbs are adapted for storing nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
