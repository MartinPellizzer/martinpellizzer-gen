    "intro": "Carex panicea f. nigra, commonly known as black tufted sedge, is a perennial plant native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, grass-like foliage and produces dense, upright clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant prefers moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream edges. It has a clumping growth habit and is often used in wetland restoration projects. Its ornamental value comes from its striking dark foliage and delicate floral display."
