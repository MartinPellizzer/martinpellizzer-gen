    "intro": "Chamaedorea pacaya, commonly known as the pacaya bamboo palm, is a member of the Arecaceae family. It is a compact, evergreen plant native to Central America, particularly found in Mexico and Guatemala. The plant features slender, arching leaves that give it a lush, tropical appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Chamaedorea pacaya is popular as a houseplant due to its air-purifying qualities and low maintenance requirements."
