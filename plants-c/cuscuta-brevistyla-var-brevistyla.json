    "intro": "Cuscuta brevistyla var. brevistyla, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It has small, thread-like stems that\u7f20\u7ed5 (twine) around its host, often forming a dense network. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and relies on wind for pollination. Its seeds are typically dispersed by animals or through mechanical means. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants."
