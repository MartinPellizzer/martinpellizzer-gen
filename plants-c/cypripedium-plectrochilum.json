    "intro": "Cypripedium plectrochilum, commonly known as the broad-leaved lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pouch-shaped lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its leaves are broad and leathery, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species in many parts of its range."
