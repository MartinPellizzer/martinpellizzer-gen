    "intro": "Celtis dichotoma, commonly known as the burr oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and distinctive, compound leaves that are alternate and pinnately arranged. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits that split open to reveal tufts of hair, aiding in seed dispersal. Celtis dichotoma is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in bottomlands. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
