It produces small, round fruits that are typically yellow when ripe, with a thick, aromatic peel. The plant has fragrant, dark green leaves and is often grown for its ornamental value as well as its edible fruit. Its flowers are white and fragrant, resembling those of other citrus species. The fruit is used in both culinary and medicinal applications, though it is less common than other citrus fruits."
