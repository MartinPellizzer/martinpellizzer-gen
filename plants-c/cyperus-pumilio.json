It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often forming dense mats near water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Cyperus pumilio is known for its ability to thrive in shallow water and is often used in aquatic landscaping. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
