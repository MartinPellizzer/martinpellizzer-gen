    "intro": "Caltha natans, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow water, such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows, where its rhizomes anchor it to the substrate. The plant features delicate, floating leaves that are divided into thread-like segments, and it produces yellowish-green flowers in early spring. Its flowers are clustered in a dense, rounded inflorescence and are pollinated by insects. Caltha natans plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish."
