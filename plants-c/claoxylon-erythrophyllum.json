It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes species known for their hard, durable wood. The plant is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and striking red or orange leaves that turn vibrant during the dry season. It produces small, fragrant flowers followed by woody capsules containing elliptical seeds. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is often found in protected forest areas."
