    "intro": "Cryptophragmium glabrum, commonly known as the smooth cryptophragmium, is a rare and little-known species of lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its pale yellow to orange-brown thallus, which is typically smooth and lacks distinct lobes. The lichen forms a crustose growth on bark and stone, often in shaded, humid environments. It is widely distributed in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, though it remains poorly studied. Due to its subtle appearance and limited habitat, it is considered a cryptic species that is challenging to identify without specialized knowledge."
