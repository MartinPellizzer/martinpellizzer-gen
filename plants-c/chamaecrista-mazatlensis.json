    "intro": "Chamaecrista mazatlensis, commonly known as the Mexican burr legume, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by distinctive, spiny pods that contain seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into multiple pairs of leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. Chamaecrista mazatlensis is also known for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock."
