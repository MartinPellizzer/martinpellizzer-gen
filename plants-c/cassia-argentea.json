    "intro": "Cassia argentea, commonly known as silverleaf cassia, is a tropical shrub native to Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by elongated, slender pods containing flat, winged seeds. Cassia argentea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in herbal medicine. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
