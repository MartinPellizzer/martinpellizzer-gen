It is native to regions of southern Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Its milky sap, characteristic of the genus, contains latex and has been used historically in traditional medicine. Cynanchica rumelica is also noted for its role in supporting local pollinators, particularly butterflies."
