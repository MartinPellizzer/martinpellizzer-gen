    "intro": "Cohniella amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a unique symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, which it relies on for nutrient absorption. Its flowers are typically small and pale, often appearing in clusters along the stems. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from deforestation, Cohniella amazonica is considered endangered and is rarely seen in the wild."
