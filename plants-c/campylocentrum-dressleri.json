    "intro": "Campylocentrum dressleri, commonly known as the velvet tangerine, is a species of citrus plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, and often reddish-orange rind, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically harvested when they reach a mature size and color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The leaves are dark green, glossy, and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value."
