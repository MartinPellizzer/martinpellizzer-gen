    "intro": "Cyperus granularis, commonly known as the rough flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually green or brown in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in its native habitat. Cyperus granularis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various organisms."
