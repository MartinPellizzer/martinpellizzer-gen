    "intro": "Cuphea racemosa var. palustris, commonly known as swamp cuphea, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features showy, red-orange tubular flowers that bloom in dense, spike-like clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and its stems are often hairy and glandular. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland gardens."
