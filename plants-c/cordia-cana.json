    "intro": "Cordia cana, commonly known as the red cordia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and simple, ovate leaves that are usually opposite in arrangement. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in clusters at the ends of branches. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Cordia cana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
