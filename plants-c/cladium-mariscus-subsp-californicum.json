    "intro": "Cladium mariscus subsp. californicum, commonly known as California sawgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems and long, narrow leaves that are often coated with a waxy layer. This plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and shallow water areas, where it helps stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to the structure of the ecosystem. The plant plays an important role in nutrient cycling and water filtration in its native wetland habitats."
