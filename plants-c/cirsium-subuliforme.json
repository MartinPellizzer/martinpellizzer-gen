    "intro": "Cirsium subuliforme, commonly known as the slender thistle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its spiny, lance-shaped leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its foliage is covered in fine, bristly hairs, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. Cirsium subuliforme is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
