    "intro": "Cerastium syvaschicum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, high-altitude habitat. It typically grows in rocky soils and alpine meadows, often forming dense mats that stabilize the soil. Cerastium syvaschicum is well adapted to cold climates and can withstand harsh environmental conditions."
