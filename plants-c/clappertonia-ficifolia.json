    "intro": "Clappertonia ficifolia, commonly known as the fig-leaf tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of a fig tree, hence its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically hidden within its foliage. Its fruit, though not commonly consumed by humans, is an important food source for various wildlife species. Clappertonia ficifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
