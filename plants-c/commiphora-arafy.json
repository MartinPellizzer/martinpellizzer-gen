    "intro": "Commiphora arafy, commonly known as Arafy myrrh, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes other resin-producing plants like frankincense and myrrh. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored resin, which has been traditionally used in incense and medicinal applications. Its leaves are typically leathery and glossy, while its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by woody, spiny fruits. The resin exuded from its bark and stems is a key botanical feature, contributing to its historical and cultural significance."
