    "intro": "Cheiranthus nivalis, commonly known as the snowchequer, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with characteristic cruciform flowers. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, often in clusters at the ends of its hairy stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
