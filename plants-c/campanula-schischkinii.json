It features upright stems with lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value and hardiness make it a popular choice among gardeners interested in cultivating drought-tolerant plants."
