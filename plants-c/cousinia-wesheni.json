    "intro": "Cousinia wesheni, commonly known as the Kashmiri globeflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular inflorescence composed of numerous small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-forming, and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. Cousinia wesheni is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
