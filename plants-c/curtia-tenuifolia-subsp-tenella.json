    "intro": "Curtia tenuifolia subsp. tenella, commonly known as the slender-leafed curtia, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by elongated, three-lobed fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
