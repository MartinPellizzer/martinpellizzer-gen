    "intro": "Cymbopogon papillipes, commonly known as the hairy lemon grass, is a perennial grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, tropical climates and is often found in wetlands or along water bodies. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is not widely cultivated for commercial purposes."
