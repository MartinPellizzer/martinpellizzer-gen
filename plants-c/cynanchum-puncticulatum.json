    "intro": "Cynanchum puncticulatum, commonly known as the punctuated milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to regions of Asia, including China and Russia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation and is a defense mechanism against herbivores. Cynanchum puncticulatum is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
