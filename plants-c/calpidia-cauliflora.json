    "intro": "Calpidia cauliflora, commonly known as the calpidia cauliflower, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, where flowers develop directly on the stem rather than at the ends of branches, a phenomenon known as cauliflory. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered together in a compact, cabbage-like structure. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Calpidia cauliflora is primarily grown for its edible flower buds, which are harvested before they fully open."
