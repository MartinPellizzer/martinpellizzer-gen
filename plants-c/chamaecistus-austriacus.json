    "intro": "Chamaecistus austriacus, commonly known as Austrian rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Alps. It features woody stems covered in dense, glandular hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a white, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments."
