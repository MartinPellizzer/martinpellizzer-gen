    "intro": "Cuscuta ciliaris, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or yellow in color. The plant's stems are covered in tiny, hair-like structures called haustoria, which attach to the host and extract water and nutrients. It is commonly found in agricultural fields and gardens, where it can infest a variety of crops. Cuscuta ciliaris is an annual plant that completes its life cycle within a single growing season."
