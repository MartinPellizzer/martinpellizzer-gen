    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris scanica, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, pale green leaves with a hairy texture and produces tiny white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a taproot system and spreads through seeds dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Its botanical name reflects its historical use as a weed in agricultural settings."
