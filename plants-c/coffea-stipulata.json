    "intro": "Coffea stipulata, commonly known as the stipulate coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves with stipules at the base of each leaf pair. It produces small, white flowers that are followed by oval, red or yellow fruits containing seeds used for coffee production. The plant's botanical features make it distinct from other coffee species, though it is less commercially cultivated than Coffea arabica or Coffea canephora."
