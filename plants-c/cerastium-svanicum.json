    "intro": "Cerastium svanicum, commonly known as the alpine chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically has hairy, opposite leaves and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Cerastium svanicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in harsh mountainous habitats."
