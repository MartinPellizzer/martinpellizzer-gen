    "intro": "Cynanchum caudatum var. tanzawamontanum, commonly known as the Tanzanian whipstalk, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Tanzania. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in umbels, which are followed by follicles containing toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxic properties, it is typically avoided by herbivores and requires caution during handling."
