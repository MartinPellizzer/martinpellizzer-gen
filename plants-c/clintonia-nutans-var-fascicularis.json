    "intro": "Clintonia nutans var. fascicularis, commonly known as the nodding white trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Melanthiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive three-lobed leaves and showy white flowers that droop downward. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, well-drained soil. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and it produces small, red berries in the summer. This variety is notable for its unique floral structure and is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
