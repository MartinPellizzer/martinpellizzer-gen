It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with thorny stems and small, waxy leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, yellowish fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is cultivated in gardens and used in traditional cuisine."
