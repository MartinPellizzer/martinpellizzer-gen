    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 ostrobottnica, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Carex genus in the family Cyperaceae. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Carex remota and Carex sylvatica, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically forms dense clumps of grass-like leaves, with spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands, stream banks, and forest floors. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive mats, contributing to soil stabilization in wet habitats."
