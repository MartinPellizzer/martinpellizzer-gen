    "intro": "Crossoglossa gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry's crosslip, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers with spurred petals. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions to thrive. Its leaves are often lance-shaped and covered in fine, hairy textures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Crossoglossa gentryi is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
