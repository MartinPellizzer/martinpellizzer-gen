    "intro": "Cremanthodium botrycephalum, commonly known as the woolly sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high alpine regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a dense, spherical cluster at the top of its stems. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hairs, providing insulation against freezing temperatures. Cremanthodium botrycephalum is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or scree habitats at high elevations."
