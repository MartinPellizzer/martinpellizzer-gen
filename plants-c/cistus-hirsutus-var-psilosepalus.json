    "intro": "Cistus hirsutus var. psilosepalus, commonly known as the narrow-sepal rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and distinctive, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The narrow sepals of this variety give it a unique floral appearance compared to other cistus species."
