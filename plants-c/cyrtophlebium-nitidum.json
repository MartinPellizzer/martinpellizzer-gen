    "intro": "Cyrtophlebium nitidum, commonly known as the glossy shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery, and glossy dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, shield-like structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture for its attractive foliage."
