    "intro": "Carex vulgaris var. elatior, commonly known as the tall sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with stamens and pistils arranged in a single layer."
