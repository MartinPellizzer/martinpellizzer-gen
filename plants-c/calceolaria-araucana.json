It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that range in color from violet to orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces showy, bilaterally symmetrical blooms that are adapted to attract specific pollinators, such as bees and hummingbirds. Its foliage consists of lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. Calceolaria araucana thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude regions with well-drained soil."
