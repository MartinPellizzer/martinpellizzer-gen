    "intro": "Caralluma dodsoniana, commonly known as the desert cactus or ghost cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help protect it from herbivores and reduce transpiration. Caralluma dodsoniana is well adapted to extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
