    "intro": "Croatiella, commonly known as the croatian bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the Campanulaceae family. It consists of several species native to Europe, particularly the Balkans, and is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet. The plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. They have opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produce small, showy flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Croatiella species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens."
