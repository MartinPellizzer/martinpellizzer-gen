    "intro": "Chamaeraphis abortiva, commonly known as the sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and western Europe. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pungent aroma. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, while its fruits are small, dry pods that release seeds explosively. Chamaeraphis abortiva plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
