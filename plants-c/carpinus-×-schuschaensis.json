    "intro": "Carpinus \u00d7 schuschaensis, commonly known as the Schuscha hybrid hornbeam, is a natural hybrid between Carpinus betulus and Carpinus caroliniana. It is a deciduous tree or shrub that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland habitats. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are often pubescent on the underside, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. Its fruits are samaras, which are winged seeds that aid in wind dispersal. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
