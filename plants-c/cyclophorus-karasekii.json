    "intro": "Cyclophorus karasekii, commonly known as the Karasek's cyclophorus, is a species of flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense, globular inflorescence, which is a distinctive feature of the genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
