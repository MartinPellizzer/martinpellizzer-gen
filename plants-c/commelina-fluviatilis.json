    "intro": "Commelina fluviatilis, commonly known as the river commelina, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet bracts that enclose the small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The species is part of the Commelinaceae family, which includes many plants adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
