    "intro": "Coreopsis lineata, commonly known as the linear coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and features narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers bloom in the summer months and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Coreopsis lineata is well-suited for gardens and natural landscapes due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
