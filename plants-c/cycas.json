    "intro": "Cycas, commonly known as sago palms, are ancient seed plants that have existed since the Mesozoic era. They are gymnosperms, characterized by their lack of flowers and the production of cones instead of fruits. Cycas species typically have a stout, unbranched trunk with a crown of pinnately compound leaves. Their leaves are usually thick and waxy, adapted to arid environments. These plants are often found in tropical and subtropical regions and are valued for their ornamental appeal."
