    "intro": "Centrocarpha subtomentosa, commonly known as the woolly goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its scientific name reflects its fuzzy appearance, with \"subtomentosa\" referring to the dense, soft pubescence on its stems and leaves. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
