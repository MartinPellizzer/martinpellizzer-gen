    "intro": "Centropogon caoutchouc, commonly known as rubber vine, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and tubular flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to produce natural rubber, which has historically been harvested from its latex. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are typically pink or red. Due to its rubber-producing properties, it has been cultivated in various tropical regions for commercial use."
