    "intro": "Caroxylon decussatum, commonly known as the mountain cedar, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are typically deciduous, turning reddish-brown in the fall. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a slow growth rate. Caroxylon decussatum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
