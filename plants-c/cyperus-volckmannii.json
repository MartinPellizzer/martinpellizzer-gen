    "intro": "Cyperus volckmannii, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, such as marshes and wetlands. Its small, three-lobed flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Cyperus volckmannii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
