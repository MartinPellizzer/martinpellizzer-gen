    "intro": "Cordyla somalensis subsp. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal cordyla, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of Somalia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, narrow leaves adapted to arid and saline environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, often in areas with high salt exposure. Due to its resilience, it plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion."
