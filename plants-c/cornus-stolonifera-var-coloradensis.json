    "intro": "Cornus stolonifera var. coloradensis, commonly known as the Colorado dogwood, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, spreading growth habit and its ability to form mats through stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by red or purple berries in the fall. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. This variety is well adapted to rocky soils and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
