    "intro": "Cypripedium miteauanum, commonly known as the golden tibetan orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family found in the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow and green flowers with intricate patterns resembling a crown, which give it its common name. The plant has a pseudobulb structure and produces a single, upright flower with a distinctive lip that is often adorned with a fuzzy texture. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the extreme conditions of its alpine habitat. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species and is often protected in conservation efforts."
