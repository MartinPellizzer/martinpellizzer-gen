It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of silvery, hairy leaves. The plant produces a single, tall flowering stem that bears small, white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
