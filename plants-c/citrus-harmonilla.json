It produces small, round citrus fruits with a thin, yellowish skin and a sweet, juicy pulp. The plant thrives in warm, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are glossy and dark green, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible fruit. The plant is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
