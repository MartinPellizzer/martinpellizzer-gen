    "intro": "Cliftonia nitida, commonly known as the smoothleaf cliftonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, smooth, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy areas. Cliftonia nitida is relatively rare and has limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
