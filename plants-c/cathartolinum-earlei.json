    "intro": "Cathartolinum earlei, commonly known as the earlei's cathartolinum, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, velvety purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has heart-shaped, broad leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in its natural range."
