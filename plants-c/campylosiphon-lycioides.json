    "intro": "Campylosiphon lycioides, commonly known as the red sandalwood or redwood, is a flowering plant native to the southern regions of Africa. It is a small shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture, which helps it conserve water in arid conditions. The plant is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been historically used in construction and furniture-making."
