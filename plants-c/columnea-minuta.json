    "intro": "Columnea minuta, commonly known as the dwarf flame flower, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 30 centimeters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value. Columnea minuta requires well-draining soil and moderate watering to prevent root rot."
