    "intro": "Cormigonus tetrandus, commonly known as the four-threaded corm, is a unique plant characterized by its specialized underground storage organ called a corm. This corm is typically swollen and serves as a nutrient reservoir, enabling the plant to survive adverse conditions. The plant's foliage consists of long, narrow leaves that emerge from the base of the corm. It produces small, clustered flowers with four distinct stamens, giving it its scientific name. Cormigonus tetrandus is often found in moist, shaded environments, thriving in temperate climates."
