    "intro": "Coelogyne barbifrons, commonly known as the hairy-lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, often fragrant flowers that can be white, yellow, or pink, with prominent hairy structures on the lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered in a thick, leathery layer that helps store water. Coelogyne barbifrons thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
