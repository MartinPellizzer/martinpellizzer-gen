    "intro": "Calamus sepal, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features long, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, with the leaves emerging from a rhizomatous root system. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The calamus sepal thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is popular in aquariums for its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
