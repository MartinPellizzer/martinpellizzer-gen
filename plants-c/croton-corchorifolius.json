    "intro": "Croton corchorifolius, commonly known as the Indian croton, is a shrub native to parts of Asia, including India and China. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically green with prominent veins and sometimes exhibit variegation. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by woody, spiny capsules containing seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it may be invasive in some regions."
