    "intro": "Calamagrostis montanensis, commonly known as mountain reed, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in meadows. The plant features tall, slender stalks with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often silver-white beneath. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. Calamagrostis montanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland and riparian habitats."
