    "intro": "Capillipedium spicigerum, commonly known as the spiked beard lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae. It is characterized by its dense, upright, spiny growth of the upper cortex, which gives it its common name. The thallus is typically crustose, forming a tightly adherent layer on rock surfaces, especially in moist, shaded environments. It is found in temperate regions and is often associated with calcareous substrates. The lichen's structure and growth form make it distinct within its family, contributing to its ecological and taxonomic significance."
