    "intro": "Cirsium yuki-uenoanum, commonly known as the Yuki-ueno thistle, is a rare and endemic species native to Japan. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and large, purple-tinged leaves. The plant produces purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
