It produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, pale yellow, and pink, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in woodland areas or along shaded paths. It is a member of the Iridaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and early flowering habit. The variety 'pusillus' is distinguished by its smaller size compared to the typical crocus vernus."
