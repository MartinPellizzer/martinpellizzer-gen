    "intro": "Cirsium otayae, commonly known as the Otay thistle, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, purple-blue flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is distinguished by its composite flower structure. Its leaves are typically gray-green with coarse teeth and are covered in fine hairs. Cirsium otayae is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
