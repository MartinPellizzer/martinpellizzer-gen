    "intro": "Ctenopteris athyrioides, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are deeply divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its leaves are used in traditional medicine in some cultures. The fern's ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and horticultural displays."
