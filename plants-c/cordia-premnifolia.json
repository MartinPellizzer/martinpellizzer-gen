    "intro": "Cordia premnifolia, commonly known as the white cedar or white mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the Americas. It is characterized by its smooth, whitish bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. It thrives in brackish or saline environments, often found in coastal areas and mangrove forests. Its roots help stabilize shorelines, making it ecologically significant in coastal ecosystems."
