    "intro": "Cyclosorus rotumaensis, commonly known as the Rotuma shield fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Rotuma in the South Pacific. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant exhibits a unique growth pattern, with its fronds often curling into a compact, protective form. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, adapted to the humid and tropical conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclosorus rotumaensis is considered a vulnerable species."
