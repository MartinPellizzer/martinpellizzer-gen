It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. Its showy, red-orange berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Native to the tropical regions of South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments."
