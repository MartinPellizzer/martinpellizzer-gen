    "intro": "Cojoba, commonly known as sea bean, is a tropical plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico, where it thrives in sandy soils near the shoreline. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine. Cojoba is also valued for its ability to stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion along coastal areas."
