    "intro": "Cercis japonica, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan and Korea. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that change color with the seasons, often displaying vibrant red, orange, and yellow hues in autumn. The plant produces small, pendulous clusters of pink or red flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a favorite for landscape design."
