    "intro": "Cyperus niveus var. flavissimus, commonly known as the golden flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like stems that often grow in dense clusters, with narrow, linear leaves that are typically light green to golden in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in wet or moist soils, making it common in marshy areas and along water bodies. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to form dense, low-maintenance ground cover."
