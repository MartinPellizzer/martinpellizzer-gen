It is characterized by its small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in the leaf axils. The plant has opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically pubescent, giving it a fuzzy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This species is known for its rapid growth and can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
