    "intro": "Cyperus trinervis var. contractus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf flatsedge, is a species of sedge native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower spikes. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils, often in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands. Botanically, it is part of the Cyperaceae family, which includes many economically and ecologically important plants."
