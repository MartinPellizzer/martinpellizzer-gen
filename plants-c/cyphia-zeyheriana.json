    "intro": "Cyphia zeyheriana, commonly known as the Zeyher's cyphia, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Aizoaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky outcrops or along coastal areas. Cyphia zeyheriana is prized for its ornamental value and is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
