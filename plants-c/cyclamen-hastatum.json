    "intro": "Cyclamen hastatum, commonly known as the Persian cyclamen, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey, Iran, and Afghanistan. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, pink or white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its tuberous roots allow it to survive harsh winters, and it is often grown as a seasonal ornamental plant. Cyclamen hastatum is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
