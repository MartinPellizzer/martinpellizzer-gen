    "intro": "Cerastium lithospermifolium var. lanatum, commonly known as the woolly mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, woolly silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are covered in a fine, soft pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates."
