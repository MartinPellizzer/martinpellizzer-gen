    "intro": "Chloroxylon chloroxylon, commonly known as the Indian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for furniture and musical instruments. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by woody, oval fruits containing a single seed. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its native range."
