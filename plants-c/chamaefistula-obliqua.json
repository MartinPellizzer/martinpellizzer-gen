    "intro": "Chamaefistula obliqua, commonly known as the Armenian thornapple, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems covered in thorny branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by spherical, spiny fruits that mature to a dark purple color. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough, leathery texture. Chamaefistula obliqua is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in shrublands and forest edges."
