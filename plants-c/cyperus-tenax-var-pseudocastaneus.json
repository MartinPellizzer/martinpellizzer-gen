It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically brown or reddish in color. This variant is native to various regions in Africa and is often found in wetland or marshy habitats. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands. The plant is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
