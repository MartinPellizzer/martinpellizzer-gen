    "intro": "Calyptranthes tatna, commonly known as the velvetleaf calyptranthes, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean region. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of white or pale pink, which bloom during the wet season. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Calyptranthes tatna is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks."
