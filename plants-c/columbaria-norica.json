    "intro": "Columbaria norica, commonly known as the Alpine columbine, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or purple spurred petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces showy, nectar-rich flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Columbaria norica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high elevation or rocky landscapes."
