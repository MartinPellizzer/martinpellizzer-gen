    "intro": "Ceratochloa unioloides var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf water clover, is a low-growing aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It typically forms dense mats on the surface of shallow, still waters. The plant has small, oval leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a clover-like appearance. It produces tiny, greenish flowers that are pollinated by wind. This species is valued in pond ecosystems for its ability to provide habitat for aquatic life and help control water quality."
