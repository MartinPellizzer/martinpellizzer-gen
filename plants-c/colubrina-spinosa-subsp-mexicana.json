    "intro": "Colubrina spinosa subsp. mexicana, commonly known as Mexican flame acanthus, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems, palmate leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of tubular, violet to purple flowers. The plant produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across arid and semi-arid regions. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in dry climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking foliage and long-lasting blooms."
