    "intro": "Coreopsis oniscicarpa, commonly known as the sand coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils, often found in coastal areas and dunes. The plant produces bright yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Coreopsis oniscicarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
