    "intro": "Cyperus turfosus, commonly known as marsh flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense mats in marshes and wetlands. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it plays an important role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems. Cyperus turfosus is also used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from contaminated water."
