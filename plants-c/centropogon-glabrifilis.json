    "intro": "Centropogon glabrifilis, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed centropogon, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean region. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in the wild."
