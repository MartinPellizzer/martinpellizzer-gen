    "intro": "Caralluma distincta, commonly known as the desert candelabra, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of India and Pakistan. It is characterized by its branching stems that resemble a candlestick, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native dry environment. Caralluma distincta is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
