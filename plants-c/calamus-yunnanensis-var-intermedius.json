It is a climbing herbaceous plant characterized by its long, flexible rhizomes and pinnate leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and riverbanks. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
