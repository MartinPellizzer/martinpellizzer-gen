    "intro": "Crepis setosa subsp. typica, commonly known as the slender mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features basal rosettes of narrow, silver-tomentose leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in dry meadows, rocky soils, and disturbed sites, often forming dense colonies. Crepis setosa subsp. typica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
