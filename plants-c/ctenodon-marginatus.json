    "intro": "Ctenodon marginatus, commonly known as the marginated ctenodon, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are often covered in fine, white or grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in humid conditions. The flowers, which are usually pink or purple, bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
