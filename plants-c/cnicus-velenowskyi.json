It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its leaves are spiny and lobed, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences."
