    "intro": "Cerastium pseudobulgaricum, commonly known as the Balkan mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that bear small, rounded leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
