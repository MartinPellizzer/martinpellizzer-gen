    "intro": "Cyperus rotundus var. comosus, commonly known as purple flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, cylindrical stems that often root at the nodes, and its leaves are narrow with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flower spikes that are typically purple or reddish in color, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, rice fields, and along waterways. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become a weed in agricultural settings."
