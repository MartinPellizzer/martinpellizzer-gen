    "intro": "Cyrtopera stolziana, commonly known as the Stolzian rock orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit, often found growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale purple, which bloom during the warmer months. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments and its role in local ecosystems. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
