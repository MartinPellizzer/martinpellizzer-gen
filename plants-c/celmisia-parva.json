    "intro": "Celmisia parva, commonly known as the dwarf celmisia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and delicate, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Celmisia parva is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
