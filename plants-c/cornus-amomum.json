    "intro": "Cornus amomum, commonly known as red osier dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive red stems that become prominent in the winter, providing important habitat and food for wildlife. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a smooth texture and a serrated margin. Cornus amomum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and forest edges."
