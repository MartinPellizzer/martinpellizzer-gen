    "intro": "Crotalaria ivantulensis, commonly known as the yellow burr legume, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces bright yellow flowers that attract pollinators. Its seeds are encased in spiny pods, which aid in seed dispersal through attachment to animals or clothing. This species is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in dry, arid environments."
