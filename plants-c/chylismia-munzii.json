    "intro": "Chylismia munzii, commonly known as the Munz's chylismia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly California. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
