    "intro": "Cystopteris spinulosa, commonly known as the spinulose water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that often grow in shallow water or moist soil. The plant has a complex life cycle involving both sporophyte and gametophyte stages. Its fronds are typically divided into small, serrated segments, and they produce spores on the underside of the leaves. Cystopteris spinulosa thrives in humid environments and is often found near streams, ponds, or in shaded wetlands."
