    "intro": "Carex ferruginea var. sempervirens, commonly known as the evergreen yellow sedge, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that remains green throughout the year, making it a valuable ornamental plant in shaded garden settings. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer, adding subtle floral interest. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form compact clumps, which are easy to maintain and suitable for moist, well-drained soils. It is often used in wetland restoration projects and as a ground cover in woodland gardens."
