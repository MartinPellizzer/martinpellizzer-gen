It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is typically found in rocky or sandy soils. It is adapted to harsh climates and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
