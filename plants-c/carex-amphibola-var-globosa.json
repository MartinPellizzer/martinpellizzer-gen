    "intro": "Carex amphibola var. globosa, commonly known as the globular sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, cylindrical leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that bloom in early to mid-summer, adding a subtle floral display. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams. Its compact, rounded growth habit makes it a valuable addition to wetland restoration projects and naturalistic garden designs."
