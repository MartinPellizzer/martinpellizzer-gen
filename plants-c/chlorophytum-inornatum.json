    "intro": "Chlorophytum inornatum, commonly known as the spider plant, is a member of the Asparagaceae family. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its long, arching leaves that resemble spider legs, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in summer. It is a popular indoor plant due to its ease of care and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Chlorophytum inornatum is also known for its ability to purify air and is often used in horticultural therapy."
