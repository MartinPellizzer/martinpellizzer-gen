    "intro": "Conchocarpus grandis, commonly known as the giant conchocarpus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, woody shrub or small tree form, often reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The plant produces distinctive, fleshy, orange-red fruits that contain a single seed, which is enclosed in a hard, spiny capsule. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough, hairy texture. Conchocarpus grandis is adapted to grow in coastal and saline environments, making it a resilient species in challenging habitats."
