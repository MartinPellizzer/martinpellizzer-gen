    "intro": "Cladostigma hildebrandtioides, commonly known as the Hildebrandt's cliffbrake, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its spore-producing structures are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
