    "intro": "Cleobula pinnata, commonly known as the featherleaf sedge, is a perennial plant native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, feather-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, forming a low, mat-like structure that helps stabilize soil in wet environments. Cleobula pinnata produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spikelets. It plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
