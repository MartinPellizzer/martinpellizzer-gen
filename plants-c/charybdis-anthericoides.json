    "intro": "Charybdis anthericoides, commonly known as the red sea anemone, is a unique marine invertebrate belonging to the order Actinioidea. It is characterized by its vibrant red coloration and a long, flexible tentacle crown that surrounds its oral disc. This species is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches itself to rocks or coral substrates. The polyp's tentacles are equipped with specialized cells called cnidocytes, which are used to capture prey. Its ecological role is significant in marine ecosystems, contributing to the food web by preying on small planktonic organisms."
