    "intro": "Camassia quamash var. breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered camas, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are grass-like, forming a basal rosette, and it produces edible bulbs that have been traditionally used by Indigenous peoples. This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more compact flower stems compared to other camas species."
