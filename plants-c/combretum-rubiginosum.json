    "intro": "Combretum rubiginosum, commonly known as the red-stemmed combretum, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its reddish-brown stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by distinctive, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or savanna habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
