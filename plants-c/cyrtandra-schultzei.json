    "intro": "Cyrtandra schultzei, commonly known as the Hawaiian cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often in the understory of native Hawaiian forests. It has simple, opposite leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is a focus of conservation efforts in Hawaii."
