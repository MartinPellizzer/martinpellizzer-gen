    "intro": "Chamaesium novem-jugum, commonly known as the nine-lobed chamaesium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
