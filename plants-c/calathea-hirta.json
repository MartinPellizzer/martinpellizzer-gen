    "intro": "Calathea hirta, commonly known as the velvet leaf calathea, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety, and often variegated foliage, which features intricate patterns and shades of green, silver, and pink. The leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy texture that gives them a soft, almost tactile appearance. This plant thrives in humid, warm environments and requires indirect light to maintain its vibrant leaf colors. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical plant collections."
