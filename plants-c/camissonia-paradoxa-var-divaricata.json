    "intro": "Camissonia paradoxa var. divaricata, commonly known as the slender camissonia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky habitats. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is part of the Camissoniaceae family and is known for its low-growing habit and ecological importance in its native range."
