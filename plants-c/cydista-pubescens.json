    "intro": "Cydista pubescens, commonly known as the hairy cydista, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it often grows in sandy or rocky soils. Cydista pubescens is native to regions in southern Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss, making it well adapted to its harsh habitat."
