    "intro": "Cassupa pittieri, commonly known as the golden cupplant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with yellow or reddish hues. The plant produces tall, branched stems that bear clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the summer months. Its flowers are surrounded by specialized leaf-like structures called bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Cassupa pittieri is adapted to wetland environments and plays a role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife."
