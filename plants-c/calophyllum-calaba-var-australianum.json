    "intro": "Calophyllum calaba var. australianum, commonly known as the Australian calophyllum, is a tropical evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and elliptical, glossy green leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, orange-red fruits containing numerous seeds. Its growth habit is typically slow, and it thrives in well-drained soils with ample sunlight. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by Indigenous communities."
