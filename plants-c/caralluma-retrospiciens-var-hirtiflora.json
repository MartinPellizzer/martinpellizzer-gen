    "intro": "Caralluma retrospiciens var. hirtiflora, commonly known as the hairy-flowered nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, hairy flowers that are typically yellow or orange, often blooming at night. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in low-water conditions."
