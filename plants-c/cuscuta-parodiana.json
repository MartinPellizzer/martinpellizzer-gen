    "intro": "Cuscuta parodiana, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure with thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to various regions in the Americas and is often found parasitizing crops and wild plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, contributing to its widespread distribution. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
