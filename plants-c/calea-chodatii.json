    "intro": "Calea chodatii, commonly known as the \"flower of the night,\" is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night and close during the day, a phenomenon known as nyctinasty. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its hairy, lance-shaped leaves. Its unique flowering behavior makes it a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture. Calea chodatii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
