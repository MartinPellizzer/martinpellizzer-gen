    "intro": "Carduus arabicus, commonly known as the Arabian thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, with rough, hairy stems and lobed, silvery-green leaves. Its flowers bloom in late summer, producing a yellow color that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Carduus arabicus is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
