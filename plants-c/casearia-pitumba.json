    "intro": "Casearia pitumba, commonly known as the Brazilian beautyberry, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its clusters of small, bright purple berries that appear in the fall. These berries are edible but not commonly consumed by humans due to their tart flavor. The leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a slightly rough texture."
