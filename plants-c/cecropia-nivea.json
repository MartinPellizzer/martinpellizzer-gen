    "intro": "Cecropia nivea, commonly known as the white cecropia, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and striking white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a unique relationship with ants, providing them with shelter in exchange for protection against herbivores. Its hollow stems are often used as nesting sites by birds and other small animals. The tree is also valued for its lightweight wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
