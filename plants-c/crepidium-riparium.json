    "intro": "Crepidium riparium, commonly known as the river orchid, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It typically grows in shallow water or along the edges of streams and rivers, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil, making it ecologically important in flood-prone areas. Crepidium riparium is often found in temperate regions of North America and is valued for its ornamental and ecological roles."
