It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in yellow or orange hues. The plant produces a unique structure called a \"catasetum,\" which is a specialized organ used in pollination. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
