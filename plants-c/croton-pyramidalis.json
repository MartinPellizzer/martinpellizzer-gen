    "intro": "Croton pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often brightly colored in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
