    "intro": "Colutea galegifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved brookweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, hairy pod that splits open upon maturity to release the seeds. Colutea galegifolia is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in supporting insect life."
