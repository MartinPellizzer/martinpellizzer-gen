    "intro": "Caucaea pseudoandigena, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet or blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy layer that helps retain moisture. Caucaea pseudoandigena is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
