    "intro": "Cotoneaster angustus, commonly known as the narrowleaf cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, upright branches and small, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Cotoneaster angustus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value, hardiness, and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
