    "intro": "Cocos ventricosa, commonly known as the mountain coconut or the giant mountain palm, is a unique species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces large, fibrous fruits that contain a single, edible kernel. Unlike typical coconut palms, it thrives in cooler, higher-altitude environments. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
