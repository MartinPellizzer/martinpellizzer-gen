    "intro": "Convolvulus cantabrica subsp. atlantis, commonly known as the Atlantic bindweed, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic coastal regions of Europe. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky shores. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are hairy and can climb or spread along the ground. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to harsh coastal environments and its role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
