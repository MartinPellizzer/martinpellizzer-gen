    "intro": "Clematis alpina var. occidentalis, commonly known as the western alpine clematis, is a deciduous vine native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features slender, woody stems that climb by means of hooked tendrils, and its leaves are compound, typically with three to five leaflets. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy choice for alpine gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for rock gardens and as a climbing plant in suitable environments."
