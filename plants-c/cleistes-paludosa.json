    "intro": "Cleistes paludosa, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in North America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that resemble orchids. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in swampy or boggy habitats. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in late spring to early summer. Cleistes paludosa plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators in its native wetland ecosystems."
