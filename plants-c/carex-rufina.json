    "intro": "Carex rufina, commonly known as redstem sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves that are typically green with reddish hues along the midribs. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often pale green to brown in color. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Carex rufina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments."
