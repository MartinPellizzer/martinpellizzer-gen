    "intro": "Crepis glabra, commonly known as the smooth hairgrass, is a species of flowering plant in the daisy family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that appear in clusters. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces numerous small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its botanical features make it a common component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in ecological and botanical research."
