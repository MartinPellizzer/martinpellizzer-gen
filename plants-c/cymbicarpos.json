    "intro": "Cymbicarpos, commonly known as the \"desert rose,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae. It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their spiny stems and showy, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink, red, and white. Cymbicarpos species are typically shrubs or small trees, adapted to survive in hot, dry environments. Their succulent leaves and thick, fleshy stems help store water, making them well-suited for desert conditions."
