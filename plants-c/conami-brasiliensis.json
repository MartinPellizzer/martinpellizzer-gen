    "intro": "Conami brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants such as tomatoes and peppers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dark green, ovate leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. Its fruits are small, berry-like, and contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous if ingested. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though with caution."
