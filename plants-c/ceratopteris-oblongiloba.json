    "intro": "Ceratopteris oblongiloba, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It features fronds that are broad, lobed, and often divided into segments, giving it a distinctive, lacy appearance. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments and is often found in wetlands and rice paddies. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. Ceratopteris oblongiloba is also used in scientific research for its ability to tolerate various water conditions and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
