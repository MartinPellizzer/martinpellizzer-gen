    "intro": "Chamaetaxus, commonly known as the yew tree, is a genus of evergreen shrubs and trees belonging to the family Taxaceae. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves and woody, often toxic seeds enclosed in a fleshy, red aril. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Asia, Europe, and North America. Chamaetaxus species are typically slow-growing and can live for hundreds of years, making them long-lived components of forest ecosystems. Their unique morphology and chemical composition have made them subjects of both ecological and pharmacological interest."
