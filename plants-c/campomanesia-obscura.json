    "intro": "Campomanesia obscura, commonly known as the dark campomanesia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of eastern Brazil. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes other economically important plants like eucalyptus and guava. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a small, round drupe with a sweet, edible pulp, though it is not widely cultivated. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened and is of interest for conservation and botanical research."
