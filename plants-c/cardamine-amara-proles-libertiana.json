    "intro": "Cardamine amara proles libertiana, commonly known as the Libertian bitter cress, is a rare and delicate herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky soils and mountain streams. Its leaves are glossy and have a slightly bitter taste, while its flowers are pale yellow with four petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
