It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are deeply lobed and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a dense, spherical cluster.
