    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna var. ferox, commonly known as the bristly hawthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches and small, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces white to pink flowers in spring, followed by red, fleshy berries in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
