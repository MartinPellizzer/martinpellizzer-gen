    "intro": "Chomutowia ekatherinae, commonly known as the Katherine's chomutowia, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep purple to vibrant red. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chomutowia ekatherinae is considered a species of conservation concern."
