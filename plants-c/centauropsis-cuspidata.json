It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as a shrub with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside its native region."
