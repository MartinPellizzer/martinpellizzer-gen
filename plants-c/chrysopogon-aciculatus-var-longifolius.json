    "intro": "Chrysopogon aciculatus var. longifolius, commonly known as the longleaf chrysopogon, is a perennial grass native to certain regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or marshy environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
