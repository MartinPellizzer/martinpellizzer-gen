    "intro": "Cerastium commersonianum var. darwinianum, commonly known as Darwin's mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southern regions of South America. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, hairy, ovate leaves and produces clusters of white, five-petaled flowers in early spring. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
