    "intro": "Carex subteinogyna, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedgeland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and wetlands, where it forms dense clumps. Its flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats. Carex subteinogyna is valued for its ecological importance in supporting biodiversity in wetland ecosystems."
