It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and bright yellow inflorescences that bloom in clusters. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. The leaves and flowers are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
