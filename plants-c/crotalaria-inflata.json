    "intro": "Crotalaria inflata, commonly known as the inflated crownflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, inflated seed pods. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with upright stems and palmate leaves. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a spurred shape that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. The seeds are enclosed in a large, balloon-like pod that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
