    "intro": "Chondrilla macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-seeded burrweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces large, spherical fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered an invasive species in some areas outside its native range."
