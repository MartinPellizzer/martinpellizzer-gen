    "intro": "Cestrum knappiae, commonly known as the Knapp's nightshade, is a species of flowering plant native to Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale purple, blooming in the evening. These flowers emit a strong, often unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators such as moths. The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is known for its ornamental value despite its pungent fragrance."
