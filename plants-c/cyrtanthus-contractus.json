    "intro": "Cyrtanthus contractus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cyclamen, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tuberous root system, which allows it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. Cyrtanthus contractus prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers."
