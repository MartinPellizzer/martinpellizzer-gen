    "intro": "Cyclostigma xalapense, commonly known as the Xalapa cyclostigma, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that bloom in late spring, often displaying a blend of red, orange, and yellow hues. The plant has a compact growth habit with waxy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along its stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
