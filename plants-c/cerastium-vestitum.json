    "intro": "Cerastium vestitum, commonly known as hairy mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Cerastium vestitum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
