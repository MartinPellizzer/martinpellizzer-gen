    "intro": "Chaetacanthus costatus, commonly known as the ridged spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
