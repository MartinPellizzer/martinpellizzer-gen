    "intro": "Caiophora dumetorum, commonly known as the dwarf bellflower, is a small herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often appearing in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, elongated fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Caiophora dumetorum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
