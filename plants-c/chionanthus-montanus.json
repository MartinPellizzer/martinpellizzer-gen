    "intro": "Chionanthus montanus, commonly known as the mountain chionanthus, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a striking visual element to its habitat. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and ovate, with a smooth margin and a slightly pubescent underside. The mountain chionanthus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
