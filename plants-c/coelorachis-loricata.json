It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plant features intricate, lanceolate leaves with a dense covering of small, scale-like structures that provide protection. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Coelorachis loricata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks."
