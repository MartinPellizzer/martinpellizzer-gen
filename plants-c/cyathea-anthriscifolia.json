It features a stout, unbranched trunk that is covered with a thick layer of persistent, fibrous roots. The plant produces large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. Its fronds are typically bright green and have a distinctive, somewhat triangular shape. Cyathea anthriscifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
