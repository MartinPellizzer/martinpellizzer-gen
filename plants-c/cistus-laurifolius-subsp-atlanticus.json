    "intro": "Cistus laurifolius subsp. atlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic rock rose, is a shrub native to the western Iberian Peninsula and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with leathery, elliptical leaves that are dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or pale purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and used in traditional herbal medicine."
