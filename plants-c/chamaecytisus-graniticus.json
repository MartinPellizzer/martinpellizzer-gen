    "intro": "Chamaecytisus graniticus, commonly known as the granite broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the rocky landscapes of western Europe. It features slender, arching stems covered in dense, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on limestone or granite outcrops. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil on slopes."
