    "intro": "Celastrus acuminatus var. microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved staff-vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features opposite, simple, and typically elliptic or ovate leaves that are smaller than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, fleshy fruits containing several seeds. Its stems are often branched and can have a slightly hairy texture. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and growth habit."
