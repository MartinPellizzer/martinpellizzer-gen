    "intro": "Cirsium pisidium, commonly known as the Crimean thistle, is a perennial plant native to the Caucasus and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its spiny, gray-green foliage and purple to pinkish flower heads that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered with stiff, bristly hairs, while its flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets. Cirsium pisidium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
