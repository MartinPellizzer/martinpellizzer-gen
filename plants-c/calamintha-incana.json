It features aromatic, gray-green foliage with a fuzzy texture due to dense pubescence. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in whorled clusters along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Calamintha incana is often used in herbal medicine for its purported calming and digestive properties."
