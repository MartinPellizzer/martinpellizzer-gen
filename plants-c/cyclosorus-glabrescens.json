    "intro": "Cyclosorus glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern native to the freshwater regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in still or slow-moving waters, where it attaches itself to submerged rocks or logs. The plant has slender, branching fronds that are covered in a smooth, waxy surface, which helps reduce water resistance. Its spores are released into the water column, allowing for dispersal to new habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
