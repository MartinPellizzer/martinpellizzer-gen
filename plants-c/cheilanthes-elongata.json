    "intro": "Cheilanthes elongata, commonly known as the slender lip fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery trichomes. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions due to its deep root system and succulent-like leaves. It produces small, greenish to brownish spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. This fern is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
