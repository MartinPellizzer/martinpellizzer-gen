    "intro": "Couthovia brassii, commonly known as the golden spire plant, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and vibrant yellow flowers. Native to the arid regions of southern Africa, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant's unique inflorescence consists of a single, elongated flower head surrounded by bracts that resemble a crown. It is drought-tolerant and often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements. Couthovia brassii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
