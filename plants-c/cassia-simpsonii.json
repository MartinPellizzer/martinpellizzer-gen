    "intro": "Cassia simpsonii, commonly known as Simpson's cassia, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the coastal regions of southern California, where it thrives in sandy soils and full sun. The plant produces bright yellow, fluffy flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments. Cassia simpsonii is often used in coastal landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
