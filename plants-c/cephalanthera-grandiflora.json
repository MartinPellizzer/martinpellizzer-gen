    "intro": "Cephalanthera grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered\u6753\u5170, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands. The plant features a single, showy, hooded flower with a distinctive yellow-green lip. Its roots contain a toxic compound called cephalantherin, which has been studied for potential medicinal uses. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in many regions."
