    "intro": "Cyperus ovularis var. wolfii, commonly known as the woolly flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown, and it thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes and swamps. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common species in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
