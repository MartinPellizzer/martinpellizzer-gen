    "intro": "Crataegus repulsans, commonly known as the American hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white to pink flowers in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Crataegus repulsans is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks."
