    "intro": "Cymbidium cyperifolium subsp. indochinense, commonly known as the Indochinese cymbidium, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and long, strap-like leaves that resemble those of the Cyperus genus. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, narrow lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
