    "intro": "Carex arenaria var. spiralis, commonly known as the spiral sedge, is a flowering plant native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial species characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets that are typically borne on slender, leaf-like bracts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along streambanks. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable moisture conditions."
