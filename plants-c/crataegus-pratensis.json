    "intro": "Crataegus pratensis, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red berries in the autumn, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus pratensis is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and grassy areas, and it plays a significant role in supporting local ecosystems. Its botanical features make it both ecologically valuable and aesthetically pleasing in natural landscapes."
