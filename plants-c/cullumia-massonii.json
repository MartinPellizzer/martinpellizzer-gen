    "intro": "Cullumia massonii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features basal rosettes of blue-green foliage and produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its fibrous roots help it retain moisture in harsh environments. Cullumia massonii is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
