    "intro": "Corynopuntia robertsii, commonly known as the Roberts' cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, branching stems that are covered in small, glochids, which are fine, barbed spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer, which are clustered in inflorescences at the ends of the stems. Its adaptations to arid environments include reduced leaves and thick, water-storing stems. Corynopuntia robertsii is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to desert conditions."
