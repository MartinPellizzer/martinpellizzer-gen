    "intro": "Convolvulus ukambensis, commonly known as the East African morning glory, is a flowering plant native to East Africa. It is a perennial vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, spherical berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals and wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
