It belongs to the Cupressaceae family and is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions with well-drained soils, preferring temperate to subtropical climates. It produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
