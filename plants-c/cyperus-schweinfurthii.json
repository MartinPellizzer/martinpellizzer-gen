It belongs to the sedge family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats. Cyperus schweinfurthii is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various water conditions."
