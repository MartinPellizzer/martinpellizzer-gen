    "intro": "Cymbachne guineensis subvar. tomentella, commonly known as the African silver grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, pale-green to brownish spikelets that are typically arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
