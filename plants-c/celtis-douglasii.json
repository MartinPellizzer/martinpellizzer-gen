    "intro": "Celtis douglasii, commonly known as the California box-elder, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It belongs to the Elaeocarpaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and palmate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. It is often found in riparian zones and can thrive in a variety of soil types, making it adaptable to different environments. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate urban conditions make it a common sight in parks and along streets."
