It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshy areas and along the edges of water bodies. Cyperus konkanensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native habitat."
