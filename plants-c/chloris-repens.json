    "intro": "Chloris repens, commonly known as common grassvetch, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant has slender, leafy stems that often lie close to the ground, with small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny blue or purple flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides. Chloris repens is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
