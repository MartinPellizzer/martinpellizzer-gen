    "intro": "Cyclosorus perakensis, commonly known as the Perak fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that often form dense clusters. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive circular pattern on the underside of the fronds. Cyclosorus perakensis is native to Southeast Asia and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticultural settings."
