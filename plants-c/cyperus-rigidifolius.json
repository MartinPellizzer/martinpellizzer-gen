    "intro": "Cyperus rigidifolius, commonly known as rigid-leaved flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, which are often surrounded by bracts. Cyperus rigidifolius is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
