    "intro": "Clerodendrum margaritense, commonly known as the \"White Trumpet\" or \"Margarita Clerodendrum,\" is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking white or pale pink tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The flowers are borne in clusters and are often pollinated by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure."
