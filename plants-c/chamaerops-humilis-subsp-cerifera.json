    "intro": "Chamaerops humilis subsp. cerifera, commonly known as the Canary Island date palm, is a small, cold-hardy palm native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, fan-shaped leaves and a short, stocky trunk. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible dates, though the fruit is typically not cultivated for consumption. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. This subspecies is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and ability to tolerate urban conditions."
