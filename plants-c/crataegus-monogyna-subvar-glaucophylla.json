    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna subvar. glaucophylla, commonly known as the white thorn, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red berries in the autumn. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges and a distinctive glaucous (bluish-gray) underside. This subspecies is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects."
