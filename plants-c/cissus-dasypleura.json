    "intro": "Cissus dasypleura, commonly known as the velvet leaf cissus, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it suitable for vertical gardening and indoor spaces."
