It is characterized by its pale white flowers, which contrast with its dark green, aromatic foliage. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its leaves are lance-shaped and emit a mint-like scent when crushed. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
