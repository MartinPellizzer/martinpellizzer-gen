    "intro": "Chondrilla juncea subsp. acantholepis, commonly known as the sand thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy, lobed leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. The subspecies is distinguished by its more robust growth and spiny leaves compared to other members of the genus."
