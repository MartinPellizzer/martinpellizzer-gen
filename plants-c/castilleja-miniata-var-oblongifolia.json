    "intro": "Castilleja miniata var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers that resemble paintbrushes. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on host plants for water and nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological role in native plant communities."
