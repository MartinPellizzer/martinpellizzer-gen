It is characterized by its pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces edible, yellow-orange fruit that is similar in appearance to a quince but has a distinct flavor. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. This variety is valued for both its ornamental beauty and its edible fruit in local cuisines."
