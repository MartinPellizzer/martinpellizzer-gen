    "intro": "Cynosurus cristatus f. tenuis, commonly known as the slender cock's-comb grass, is a variant of the cock's-comb grass species. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in grasslands and meadows. The plant features a tufted growth habit with narrow, blade-like leaves and distinctive, plume-like inflorescences. Its foliage is generally more delicate and less densely packed compared to the typical form of Cynosurus cristatus. This grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
