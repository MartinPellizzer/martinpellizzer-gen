    "intro": "Cestrum rigidum, commonly known as the rigid nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers. The flowers, which are typically white or pale purple, bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals, containing alkaloids. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and nocturnal fragrance."
