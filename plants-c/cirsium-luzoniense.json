    "intro": "Cirsium luzoniense, commonly known as Luzon thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open areas such as forests and grasslands. Its leaves are covered in stiff, bristly hairs, which help to deter herbivores. Cirsium luzoniense plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
