    "intro": "Condylocarpon pubiflorum, commonly known as the hairy-flowered condylocarpon, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically yellowish to orange in color and covered with a layer of fine, pubescent hairs. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which provides it with nutrients through photosynthesis. It is often found growing on bark, stones, or soil in temperate and tropical regions. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of environmental conditions."
