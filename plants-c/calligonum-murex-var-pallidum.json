    "intro": "Calligonum murex var. pallidum, commonly known as the pale sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It features succulent, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are often borne on short, erect pedicels. Its leaves are typically alternate and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, providing additional protection against desiccation. This variety is well-suited for xerophytic landscapes and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
