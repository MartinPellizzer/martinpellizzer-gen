    "intro": "Carex bonplandii var. humilior, commonly known as the low carex, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. The plant features grass-like leaves that are usually narrow and slightly curled at the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
