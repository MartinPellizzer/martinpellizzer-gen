    "intro": "[WRONG START] Cupressus austrotibetana, commonly known as the Tibetan cypress, is a species of conifer native to the mountainous regions of Tibet and southwestern China. It is characterized by its tall, slender form and dense, dark green foliage that is often arranged in flat sprays. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cold climates. The Tibetan cypress is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
