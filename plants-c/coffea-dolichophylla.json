    "intro": "Coffea dolichophylla, commonly known as the long-leaf coffee. It is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family, native to tropical regions of Africa. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that lead to red, fleshy fruits containing seeds used for coffee production. Its leaves are elongated and have a distinctive shape, contributing to its common name. It is primarily cultivated for its coffee beans, though it is less commercially significant than other Coffea species."
