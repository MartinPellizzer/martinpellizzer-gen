    "intro": "Cheilanthes macleanii, commonly known as the Maclean's rockcap, is a species of fern native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It is adapted to survive in dry, rocky environments, often growing on exposed limestone or sandstone. Its unique morphology and resilience make it a notable example of xerophytic adaptation in ferns."
