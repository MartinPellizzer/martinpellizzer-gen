It is native to tropical regions of South America and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by pod-like fruits containing small, dark seeds. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in agricultural systems."
