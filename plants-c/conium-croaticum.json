    "intro": "Conium croaticum, commonly known as the Croatian hemlock, is a flowering plant belonging to theApiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in umbels. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. It contains toxic compounds, including coniine, which can be harmful to both animals and humans. Due to its poisonous nature, it is typically avoided for cultivation and is more commonly encountered in the wild."
