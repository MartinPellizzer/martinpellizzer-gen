    "intro": "Centaurea pallidula, commonly known as the pale centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its small, pale blue to white flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators. Centaurea pallidula is known for its resilience to drought and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
