    "intro": "Centaurea globosa, commonly known as the globe thistle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spherical, spiky flower heads that are typically blue to purple in color. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. Its flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Centaurea globosa is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
