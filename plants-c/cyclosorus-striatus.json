    "intro": "Cyclosorus striatus, commonly known as the striped water moss, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, ribbon-like leaves that are often striated or lined with fine parallel markings. This plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. Cyclosorus striatus is a non-vascular plant, meaning it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense. Its structure consists of leaf-like structures that are specialized for absorbing water and nutrients from its surroundings."
