    "intro": "Cynanchum acutifolium, commonly known as the sharp-leaved milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is known for its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals. Cynanchum acutifolium thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woods and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and traditional herbal practices."
