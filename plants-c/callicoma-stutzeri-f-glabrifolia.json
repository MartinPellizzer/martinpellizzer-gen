    "intro": "Callicoma stutzeri f. glabrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-fruited hakea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and distinctive, often clustered inflorescences. The leaves are typically narrow and leathery, adapted to the dry, nutrient-poor soils of its natural habitat. The flowers are usually pink or red, and the plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds. This variety is notable for its reduced leaf pubescence, distinguishing it from other forms of the species."
