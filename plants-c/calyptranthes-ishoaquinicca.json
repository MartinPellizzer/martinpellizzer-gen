    "intro": "Calyptranthes ishoaquinicca, commonly known as the Ecuadorian calyptranthes, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of Ecuador and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
