    "intro": "Chaetochloa viridis var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf green hairgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to wetland and marsh environments. It features fine, dark green blades with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in association with other aquatic or semi-aquatic plants. Its compact form and ability to stabilize soil make it valuable in ecological restoration projects."
