    "intro": "Cyclosorus wenzhouensis, commonly known as the Wenzhou cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically divided into four lobes, resembling a four-leaf clover. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and ditches. It has a short, creeping rhizome and produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
