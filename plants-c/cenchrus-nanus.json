    "intro": "Cenchrus nanus, commonly known as the dwarf sand grass, is a small annual grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled, bristled seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots and a capacity to survive drought conditions. Cenchrus nanus is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is considered a pioneer species in disturbed habitats."
