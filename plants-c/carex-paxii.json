It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in rocky or mountainous regions. The plant is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like flower clusters, which are typical of the sedge family. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Carex paxii is often used in rock gardens and as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature."
