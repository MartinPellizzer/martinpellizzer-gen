    "intro": "Crepidium alagense, commonly known as the Alaskan orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the subarctic regions of North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as tundra or forested areas, where it thrives in cool, nutrient-rich soils. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and a compact growth habit, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Crepidium alagense is considered a species of conservation concern."
