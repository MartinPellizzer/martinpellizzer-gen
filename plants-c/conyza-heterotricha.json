    "intro": "Conyza heterotricha, commonly known as the hairy weed or common conyza, is a flowering plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are hairy and have a serrated edge, while the flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a cluster. It is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential ecological and medicinal properties."
