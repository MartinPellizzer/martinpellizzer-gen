    "intro": "Cardamine dimidia, commonly known as the narrowleaf water shield, is a small herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many flowering plants with distinctive cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its leaves are submerged or floating, aiding in photosynthesis in aquatic conditions. Cardamine dimidia has small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, and its seeds are dispersed by water. This species plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish."
