    "intro": "Cinchona stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved quinine tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and distinctive red or purple flowers. The plant is notable for its medicinal properties, particularly the presence of quinine in its bark, which has historically been used to treat malaria. It typically grows in humid, mountainous environments at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in its native range."
