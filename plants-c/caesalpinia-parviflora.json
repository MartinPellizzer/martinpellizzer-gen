    "intro": "Caesalpinia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered burr legume, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It features bipinnate leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces distinctive, bright red or orange cylindrical flower clusters. The plant produces woody, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Caesalpinia parviflora is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment."
