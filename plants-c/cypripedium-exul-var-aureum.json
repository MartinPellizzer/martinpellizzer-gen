    "intro": "Cypripedium exul var. aureum, commonly known as the golden tibetan lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive golden-yellow lip and a deep red or purple dorsal sepal. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, often in areas with poor soil and harsh climatic conditions. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to anchor itself in unstable terrain while absorbing nutrients from the thin soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
