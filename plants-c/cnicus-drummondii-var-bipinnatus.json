    "intro": "Cnicus drummondii var. bipinnatus, commonly known as the Drummond's thistle, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairie and steppe habitats. Its bipinnate leaf structure distinguishes it from other thistle species. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
