    "intro": "Centaurea triumfettii var. seusana, commonly known as the Spanish thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its striking purple to pink flower heads, which are composed of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands. Its leaves are usually spiny and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
