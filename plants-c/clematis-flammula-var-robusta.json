    "intro": "Clematis flammula var. robusta, commonly known as the robust clematis, is a vigorous climbing vine native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, grayish-white down. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its rapid growth and ornamental value, it is often used in gardens as a climbing plant or for covering trellises and walls."
