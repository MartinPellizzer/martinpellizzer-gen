    "intro": "Cenchrus sichuanensis, commonly known as the Sichuan sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to China. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. Cenchrus sichuanensis is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
