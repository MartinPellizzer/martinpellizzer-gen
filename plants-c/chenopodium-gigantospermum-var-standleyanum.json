    "intro": "Chenopodium gigantospermum var. standleyanum, commonly known as the giant goosefoot, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, known as a bloom, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces edible seeds that are used in some traditional cuisines. This variant is distinguished by its larger size and unique morphological characteristics compared to other members of the Chenopodium genus."
