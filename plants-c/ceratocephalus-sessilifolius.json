    "intro": "Ceratocephalus sessilifolius, commonly known as the sandbur, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes and inland plains. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they lack stalks, and are generally narrow and linear in shape. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish or yellowish in color, and appear in clusters."
