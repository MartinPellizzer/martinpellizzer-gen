    "intro": "Cousinia nana, commonly known as the dwarf globemallow, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It features dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Cousinia nana is adapted to poor, well-drained soils and can thrive in full sun conditions."
