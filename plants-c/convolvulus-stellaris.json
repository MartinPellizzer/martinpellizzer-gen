    "intro": "Convolvulus stellaris, commonly known as star morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and vibrant blue or purple star-shaped flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant is a climbing vine that produces small, fleshy fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, often found in gardens and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and ornamental value, it is both cultivated and considered a weed in some regions."
