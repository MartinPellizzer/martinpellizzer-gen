It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in mountainous regions. The plant features showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are basal, broad, and often covered in a waxy coating. The plant contains alkaloids, making it toxic but also of interest in botanical and medicinal research."
