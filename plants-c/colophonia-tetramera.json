    "intro": "Colophonia tetramera, commonly known as the four-toothed colophony, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its small, green leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers. It produces a resinous substance known as colophony, which has been used traditionally for various purposes. Due to its ecological niche and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within its native range."
