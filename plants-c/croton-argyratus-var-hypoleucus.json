    "intro": "Croton argyratus var. hypoleucus, commonly known as the silver-leaved croton, is a striking plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, silver-white leaves that contrast beautifully with its deep green veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
