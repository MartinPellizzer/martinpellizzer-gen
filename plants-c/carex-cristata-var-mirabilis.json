    "intro": "Carex cristata var. mirabilis, commonly known as the fairy grass or shaggy sedge, is a striking ornamental plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth of narrow, grass-like leaves that often form a compact rosette. The plant produces distinctive, showy inflorescences with spikes of pale green to white flowers that resemble miniature pinecones. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a valuable addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes."
