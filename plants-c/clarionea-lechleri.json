    "intro": "Clarionea lechleri, commonly known as the rubber tree, is a tropical plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It is renowned for its latex-producing properties, which have been historically harvested for natural rubber. The plant features a thick, woody trunk and large, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. The latex is extracted by making incisions in the bark, a process that has been practiced for centuries by indigenous communities."
