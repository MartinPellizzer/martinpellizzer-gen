    "intro": "Chaetospora ferruginea, commonly known as the rust lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, orange to reddish-brown thallus that often forms crust-like growths on tree bark and rock surfaces. The plant exhibits a complex symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. It is typically found in temperate and subtropical regions, often on shaded, moist substrates. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for air quality and ecological health."
