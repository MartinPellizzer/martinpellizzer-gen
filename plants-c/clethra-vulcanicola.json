    "intro": "Clethra vulcanicola, commonly known as the volcanic clethra, is a rare shrub native to the volcanic regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a humid, shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
