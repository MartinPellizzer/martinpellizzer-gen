    "intro": "Conocarpus lancifolius, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to the tropical regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its prop roots that help stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion. The plant has dark red bark and produces small, fragrant flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The red mangrove plays a vital role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
