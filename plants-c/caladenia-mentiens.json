    "intro": "Caladenia mentiens, commonly known as the pink-stemmed spider-orchid, is an Australian orchid species native to New South Wales. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant produces a single, pinkish or pale green flower with a distinctive spur, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Caladenia mentiens is often found in sandy or rocky soils in open woodland habitats. It is a protected species due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss."
