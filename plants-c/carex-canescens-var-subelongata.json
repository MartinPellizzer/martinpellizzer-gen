    "intro": "Carex canescens var. subelongata, commonly known as the long-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, rushes, and grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are longer than those of the typical Carex canescens. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, three-parted flowers, which are wind-pollinated."
