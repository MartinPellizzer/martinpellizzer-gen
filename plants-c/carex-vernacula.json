    "intro": "Carex vernacula, commonly known as the early sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features grass-like leaves that are generally narrow and slightly hairy, with a triangular cross-section. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, which are usually borne on a spiky, leaf-like bract. Carex vernacula plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
