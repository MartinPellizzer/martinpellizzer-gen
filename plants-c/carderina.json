    "intro": "Carderina, commonly known as the wild carrot or Queen Anne's lace, is a biennial plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and a flowering umbel that resembles a lace pattern. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often surrounded by a single pink or purple flower in the center. Carderina is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been naturalized in many regions around the world. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, and its seeds are dispersed by wind."
