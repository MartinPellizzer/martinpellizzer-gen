It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the shoreline. It plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and provides habitat for various insects.
