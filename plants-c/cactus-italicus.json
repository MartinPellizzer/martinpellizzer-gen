    "intro": "Cactus italicus, commonly known as the Italian cactus, is a species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny stems and ability to store water, which allows it to thrive in arid environments. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and produces yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted for drought. Cactus italicus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
