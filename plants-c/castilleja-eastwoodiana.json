    "intro": "Castilleja eastwoodiana, commonly known as Eastwood's paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, red to orange tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats like meadows and grasslands. Its striking appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in its native range."
