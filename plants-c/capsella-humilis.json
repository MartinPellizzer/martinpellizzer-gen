It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters and features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers with four petals, which appear in the spring. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature. Capsella humilis is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
