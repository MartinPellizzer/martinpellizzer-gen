    "intro": "Crepis asturica, commonly known as the Asturian mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers and hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in mountainous regions. It is a perennial herb that produces achenes as its fruit, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
