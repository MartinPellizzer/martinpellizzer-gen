    "intro": "Cyrtomium pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf cliff brake, is a small evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as cliffs and stream banks. The plant features dense, leathery, dark green fronds that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Its spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Cyrtomium pumilum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
