    "intro": "Croton trichocephalus, commonly known as the velvetleaf croton, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant's adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in disturbed environments make it a common weed in agricultural areas."
