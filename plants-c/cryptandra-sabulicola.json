    "intro": "Cryptandra sabulicola, commonly known as the sandplain cryptandra, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It typically grows in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand prolonged dry periods. The plant features small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss, and its flowers are usually pink or red, appearing in clusters. It plays an important role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local wildlife. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
