    "intro": "Cyrtanthus herrei, commonly known as the Cape tulip, is a striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and its bulbs are essential for its survival and propagation. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and Mediterranean climates. Cyrtanthus herrei is also valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
