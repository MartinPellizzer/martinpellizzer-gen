It is characterized by its fine, slender leaves and tufted inflorescences that produce small, spike-like flowers. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, wetlands, and along water bodies. It has a fibrous root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Chrysopogon filiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
