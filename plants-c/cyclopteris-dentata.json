    "intro": "Cyclopteris dentata, commonly known as the toothed cyclopteris, is a fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, doubly pinnate fronds that are often divided into tooth-like segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are somewhat fleshy and can spread to form dense colonies. The spores are produced in small, spherical clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
