    "intro": "Chloroleucon mangense var. mathewsii, commonly known as the Mathews' mangrove, is a variant of the mangrove species native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its halophytic nature, allowing it to thrive in saline and brackish water environments. The plant exhibits typical mangrove features such as aerial roots and salt-excreting leaves. Its leaves are elliptical, with a glossy green surface and a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
