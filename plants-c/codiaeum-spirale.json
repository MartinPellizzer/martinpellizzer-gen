    "intro": "Codiaeum spirale, commonly known as the flame tree or spiral leaf croton, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful leaves that often display shades of red, orange, and yellow. The leaves are spirally arranged along the stem, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil. This ornamental plant is often cultivated for its striking foliage rather than its small, inconspicuous flowers."
