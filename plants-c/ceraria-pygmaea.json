    "intro": "Ceraria pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf sandspurry, is a small flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in dunes and along the shorelines. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. Ceraria pygmaea is a low-growing perennial that plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes through its extensive root system."
