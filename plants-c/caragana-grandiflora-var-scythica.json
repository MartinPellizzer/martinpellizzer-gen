It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow pea-like flowers in early summer. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, including arid and semi-arid regions, and is often found in steppe and forest-steppe zones. Its woody stems and thorny branches make it a hardy, resilient species. It is valued for erosion control and as a source of forage for livestock."
