    "intro": "Caralluma dependens, commonly known as the creeping tiger tail or desert candelabra, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of India and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Nyctaginaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems that often trail along the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close during the heat of the day. Its leaves are typically reduced to small spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Caralluma dependens is also known for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems, making it well adapted to survive in dry conditions."
