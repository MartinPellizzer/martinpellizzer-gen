    "intro": "Cyrtandra elbertii, commonly known as the Elbert's cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and streamside areas. It has opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and is often found in the understory of native Hawaiian forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
