    "intro": "Cyrtandra latens, commonly known as the Hawaiian moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that open at night. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and stream banks. Its flowers are usually white or pale purple, with a tubular shape that attracts nocturnal pollinators like moths. Cyrtandra latens plays an important role in the ecological balance of Hawaiian ecosystems."
