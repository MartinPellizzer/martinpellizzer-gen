    "intro": "Curitiba prismatica, commonly known as the diamond leaf tree, is a tropical plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, geometrically shaped leaves that reflect light in a prism-like manner. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are evergreen and have a waxy surface, which helps in reducing water loss. Curitiba prismatica is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique foliage."
