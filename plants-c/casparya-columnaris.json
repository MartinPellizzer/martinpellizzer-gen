    "intro": "Casparya columnaris, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a species of fern native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, upright fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori located on the underside of the fronds. Casparya columnaris is a relatively rare and endangered species, making it a subject of interest for botanical conservation efforts."
