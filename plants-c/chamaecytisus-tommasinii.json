    "intro": "Chamaecytisus tommasinii, commonly known as the Tommasini broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features woody stems covered in dense, glandular hairs, which give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in terminal clusters during the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and evergreen, contributing to its drought tolerance. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils."
