    "intro": "Carex cruciata subsp. rubrobrunnea, commonly known as the red-brown sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of brownish-red flowers, which gives it its common name. It plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
