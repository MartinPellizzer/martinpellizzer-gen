    "intro": "Ceroxylon quindiuense, commonly known as the quindio wax palm, is a tall, solitary palm native to the Andean region of Colombia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 6 meters in length. The plant is known for its slow growth and longevity, with some specimens living over 100 years. It produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into dark blue berries, which are dispersed by birds. The species is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
