    "intro": "Culcitium reflexum, commonly known as the reflexed culcitium, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants such as philodendrons and calla lilies. The plant is characterized by its striking, spatulate leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. Its flowers are small and clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf known as a spathe. Culcitium reflexum is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
