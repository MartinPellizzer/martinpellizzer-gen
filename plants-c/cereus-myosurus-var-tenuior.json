    "intro": "Cereus myosurus var. tenuior, commonly known as the slender night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking, large white flowers that open at night, a feature typical of many night-blooming cacti. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in arid environments with minimal water. The flowers are ephemeral, lasting only a few hours, and are pollinated by nocturnal insects."
