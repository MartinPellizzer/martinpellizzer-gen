    "intro": "Cerastium decalvans f. rudskii, commonly known as the Siberian mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often found in open, sunny areas with well-drained soil. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in arid climates."
