    "intro": "Cotoneaster thymifolius, commonly known as the thyme-leaved cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are densely covered with fine, glandular hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable ornamental plant in gardens. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry, alpine environments."
