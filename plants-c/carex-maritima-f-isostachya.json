    "intro": "Carex maritima f. isostachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to brown in color. This plant thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it prefers moist, well-drained soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. The inflorescence consists of two distinct spikelets, with the lower one being shorter and more compact than the upper one."
