    "intro": "Carex aneurocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sedgewort, is a species of sedge native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils in forested areas, often near streams or in wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, and it produces triangular, three-sided berries. Carex aneurocarpa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
