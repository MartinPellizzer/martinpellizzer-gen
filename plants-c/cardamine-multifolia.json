    "intro": "Cardamine multifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in wet soils, often found along stream banks and in woodland areas. The leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor, making it a valued plant in some culinary traditions."
