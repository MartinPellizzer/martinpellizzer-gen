    "intro": "Carex salina var. filipendula, commonly known as salt marsh sedge, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of North America. It is a perennial herb that thrives in saline and brackish wetlands, often found in tidal marshes and estuaries. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or brown in color. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms. Its ability to tolerate high salt concentrations makes it a key component of coastal vegetation."
