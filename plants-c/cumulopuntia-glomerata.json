    "intro": "Cumulopuntia glomerata, commonly known as the clustered cactus or the desert candelabra cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that often branch into a bushy, tree-like structure. The plant produces dense clusters of white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid environments. Cumulopuntia glomerata is well adapted to hot, dry climates and is often found in rocky soils."
