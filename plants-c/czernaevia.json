    "intro": "Czernaevia, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, often yellow or golden flowers. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce showy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Czernaevia species are often found in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky soils, thriving in partial shade to full sun. Their ornamental value makes them popular in horticulture, though they are sometimes considered invasive in certain regions."
