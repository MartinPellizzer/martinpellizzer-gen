    "intro": "Centaurea aplolepa subsp. cosana, commonly known as the Cosina star-thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, glandular-stemmed structure and small, typically blue or purple flowers arranged in dense, star-like clusters. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
