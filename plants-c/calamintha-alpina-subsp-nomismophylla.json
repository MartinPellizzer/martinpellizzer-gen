    "intro": "Calamintha alpina subsp. nomismophylla, commonly known as Alpine caraway, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The subspecies is notable for its strong, mint-like fragrance, which is due to the presence of essential oils in its leaves and flowers."
