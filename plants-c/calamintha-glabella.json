    "intro": "Calamintha glabella, commonly known as round-leaved germander, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Its small, tubular flowers are typically pink or purple and bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Calamintha glabella is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported digestive and antiseptic properties."
