    "intro": "Calyptraria eximia, commonly known as the elegant lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its bright green to yellowish thallus, which is often covered with a layer of fine, woolly hairs. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides it with nutrients through photosynthesis. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions. Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is often used as an indicator of air quality."
