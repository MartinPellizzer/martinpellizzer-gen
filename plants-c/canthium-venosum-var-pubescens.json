    "intro": "Canthium venosum var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy spiny sida, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It features woody stems covered in dense, glandular hairs, which give it its characteristic pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in spikes, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a rough texture and prominent venation. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and savannas."
