    "intro": "Cassytha racemosa f. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy cassytha, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is a climbing herb with slender, wiry stems covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters along the stems, which are often overlooked due to their modest size. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface depending on the variety. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks."
