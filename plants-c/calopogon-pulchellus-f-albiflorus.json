    "intro": "Calopogon pulchellus f. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered bog orchid, is a rare and striking variant of the bog orchid. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white flowers, which contrast with its green, strap-like leaves. This plant is typically found in wetlands and bogs in the eastern United States, where it thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils. Its slender, erect stem supports the flowers, which bloom in early summer. The f. albiflorus form is distinguished by its notably lighter floral coloration compared to the typical yellow flowers of the species."
