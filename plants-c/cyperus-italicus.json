    "intro": "Cyperus italicus, commonly known as Italian flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown, often arranged in spikelets. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, pond edges, and damp soils. Cyperus italicus is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive, upright growth habit and ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions."
