    "intro": "Camptocarpus semihastatus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed camptocarpus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its resilience to drought, it is sometimes used in landscaping and for soil stabilization in degraded areas."
