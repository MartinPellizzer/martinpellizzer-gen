    "intro": "Comanthera angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved comanthera, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its slender, often branched stems. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Comanthera angustifolia is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats."
