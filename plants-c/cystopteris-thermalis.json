    "intro": "Cystopteris thermalis, commonly known as the thermal water fern, is a species of fern native to regions with high thermal activity. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a feathery appearance. This plant thrives in moist, humid environments, often found near geothermal springs or in shaded, damp areas. Its spores are released in abundance, contributing to its reproductive success in suitable microhabitats. The plant's ability to tolerate extreme temperatures and mineral-rich soils makes it a unique botanical specimen in its ecosystem."
