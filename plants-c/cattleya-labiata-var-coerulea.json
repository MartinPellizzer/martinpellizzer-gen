    "intro": "Cattleya labiata var. coerulea, commonly known as the Blue Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid prized for its striking blue-violet flowers. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in warm, humid environments. The plant features long, arching inflorescences with showy, fragrant blooms that typically measure 3 to 5 inches in diameter. It is a sympodial orchid, meaning it grows in pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
