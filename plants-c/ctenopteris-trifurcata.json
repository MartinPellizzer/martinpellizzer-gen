    "intro": "Ctenopteris trifurcata, commonly known as the three-branched water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into three main branches, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes spread along the ground, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the soil. Ctenopteris trifurcata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in aquatic and bog gardens."
