    "intro": "Chamaefistula macrophylla, commonly known as the broad-leaved boxwood, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for hedging and ornamental gardening. Its compact growth habit and resilience to pruning make it a versatile plant in both landscape design and formal gardens."
