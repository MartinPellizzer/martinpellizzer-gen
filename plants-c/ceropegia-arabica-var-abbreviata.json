It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale purple or white, which are adapted for specific pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its compact growth habit, it is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
