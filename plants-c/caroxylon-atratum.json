    "intro": "Caroxylon atratum, commonly known as the blackwood tree, is a species native to the arid regions of central Australia. It is a small to medium-sized tree with a distinctive dark, fissured bark that gives it its common name. The leaves are small, lance-shaped, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, appearing in clusters during the warmer months. The tree is well adapted to drought conditions and plays an important role in the local ecosystem."
