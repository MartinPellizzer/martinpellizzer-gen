    "intro": "Cuphea multiflora, commonly known as the whorled cuphea, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, tubular red or pink flowers that bloom in whorls along the stems. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a textured appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant ornamentals. Cuphea multiflora is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
