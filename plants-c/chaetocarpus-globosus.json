It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in gardens as a hardy, drought-tolerant plant."
