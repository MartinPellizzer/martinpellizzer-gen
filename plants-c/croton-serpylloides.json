    "intro": "Croton serpylloides, commonly known as the silverleaf croton, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
