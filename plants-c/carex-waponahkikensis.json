    "intro": "Carex waponahkikensis, commonly known as the Waponahkikensis sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. The species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in wetland ecosystems."
