    "intro": "Callitriche platycarpa var. expansa, commonly known as the broad-fruited water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that often float on the water surface, with small, opposite leaves that are usually oval to lance-shaped. Its flowers are tiny, white or pale green, and arranged in clusters, often emerging above the water. The species is characterized by its distinctive, broad, fleshy fruits that remain on the plant after flowering."
