    "intro": "Coelogyne papagena, commonly known as the Papagaena orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a pseudobulb with a single leaf and produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has a complex root system that helps it anchor to trees and absorb nutrients from the air. It blooms during the dry season, often in clusters of up to 20 flowers. Coelogyne papagena is valued for its ornamental beauty and is commonly cultivated in greenhouses and gardens."
