The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, with a distinctive spurred petal. It thrives in well-drained, mineral-rich soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture."
