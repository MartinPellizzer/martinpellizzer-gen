    "intro": "Corybas kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the Epidendraceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often hooded floral structure. The plant produces striking, violet-colored flowers that are typically small and resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It thrives in cool, humid microclimates and is often found growing on mossy rocks or in shaded forest areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
