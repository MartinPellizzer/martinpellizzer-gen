    "intro": "Caralluma bicolor, commonly known as the Two-Colored Candelabra, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its branching, cylindrical stems that often bear clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant exhibits a unique coloration, with green stems and red or orange flowers, which helps in attracting pollinators. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its thick, fleshy stems that store water. Caralluma bicolor is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
