    "intro": "Coccoloba colomensis, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive red stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in brackish water environments, often found in mangrove swamps and coastal areas. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, round fruits that disperse via water. Coccoloba colomensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
