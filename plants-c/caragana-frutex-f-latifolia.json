    "intro": "Caragana frutex f. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf shrub willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the steppes of Central Asia. It features slender, branching stems that often grow in a prostrate or upright manner, depending on environmental conditions. The leaves are alternate, simple, and typically elliptical or ovate in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in racemes, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing seeds. This plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often used for erosion control and as a forage plant."
