    "intro": "Centropogon granulosus var. aggregatus, commonly known as the clustered centropogon, is a flowering plant native to parts of Central and South America. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of white or pale yellow blooms that appear in late summer to early autumn. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or containers. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements, it is occasionally cultivated by gardeners in warmer climates."
