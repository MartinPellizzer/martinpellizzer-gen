    "intro": "Cassia oocarpa, commonly known as the golden rain tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with numerous small, oval leaflets. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, brown seeds. Cassia oocarpa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
