    "intro": "Collaea procumbens, commonly known as the coastal daisy or sea daisy, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features wiry, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along sandy or rocky shores. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Collaea procumbens is adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species of coastal ecosystems."
