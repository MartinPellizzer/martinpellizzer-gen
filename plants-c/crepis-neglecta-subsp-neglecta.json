    "intro": "Crepis neglecta subsp. neglecta, commonly known as the common mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, spoon-shaped leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom from spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette formation and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to produce achenes with pappus, aiding in wind dispersal."
