    "intro": "Carex diandra var. ramosa, commonly known as the slender marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist soils in temperate regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-brown spikelets that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. It thrives in shallow water or damp environments, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in marshy areas."
