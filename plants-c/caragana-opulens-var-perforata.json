    "intro": "Caragana opulens var. perforata, commonly known as the perforate shrub pea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, followed by elongated, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen make it useful in ecological restoration projects."
