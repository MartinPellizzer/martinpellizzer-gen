    "intro": "Chamaecerasus alpigena, commonly known as the alpine snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the autumn. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
