    "intro": "Corybas minimus, commonly known as the miniature hooded orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive hood-like flower, which is typically dark brown or reddish in color. The plant produces a single, compact inflorescence with a few showy, hooded flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest floors or on rock surfaces. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
