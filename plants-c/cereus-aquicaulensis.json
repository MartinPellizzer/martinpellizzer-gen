It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that typically bloom at night. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cereus aquicaulensis is a hardy species that is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance."
