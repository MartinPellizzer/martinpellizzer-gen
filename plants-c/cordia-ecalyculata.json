    "intro": "Cordia ecalyculata, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is often found in dry woodland and savanna habitats, and its wood is valued for its durability and fine grain. Cordia ecalyculata also has traditional medicinal uses in some African cultures."
