    "intro": "Cestrum acutifolium, commonly known as the sharp-leafed nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its berries, which are typically orange or red, are toxic to humans and animals but serve as a food source for certain birds. Cestrum acutifolium is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in arid conditions."
