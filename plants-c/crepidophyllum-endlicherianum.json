    "intro": "Crepidophyllum endlicherianum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocks or in crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense clusters, contributing to its ability to colonize rocky substrates. The leaves are leathery and have a distinctive, segmented appearance, which aids in its identification."
