    "intro": "Clematis erecta nothovar. hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid Clematis, is a vigorous climbing vine characterized by its long, slender stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. It typically produces clusters of fragrant, blue to violet blooms in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained, fertile soil for optimal growth. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and can be trained on trellises or fences. Due to its vigorous growth, it may require regular pruning to maintain its shape and encourage flowering."
