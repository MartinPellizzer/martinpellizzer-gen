    "intro": "Ceratostylis beccariana, commonly known as the Beccarian's spike orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil, while its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like. The orchid's unique floral structure and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
