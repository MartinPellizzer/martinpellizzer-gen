    "intro": "Caralluma reflexa, commonly known as the spineless nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of yellow or orange. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. It produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. Caralluma reflexa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-water conditions."
