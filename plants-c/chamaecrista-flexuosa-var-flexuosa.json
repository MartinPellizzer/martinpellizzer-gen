    "intro": "Chamaecrista flexuosa var. flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a sprawling growth habit, often forming dense mats on disturbed soils. It is adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives in well-drained conditions. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it useful for soil stabilization and ecological restoration projects."
