    "intro": "Christia vespertilionis var. vespertilionis, commonly known as the evening bat plant, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Leguminosae family and is characterized by its unique, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in late summer to early autumn. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
