    "intro": "Cyperus nduru, commonly known as the African sedges, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and clustered growth habit. It is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along water bodies. The plant has slender, triangular stems that are typically green or reddish in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Cyperus nduru is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
