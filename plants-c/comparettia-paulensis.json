It is a terrestrial herb with a short, stocky rhizome and a single, lanceolate leaf. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive violet-blue coloration and a spurred lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
