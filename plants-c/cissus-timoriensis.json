It is characterized by its pale green, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, white spots. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found growing along forest edges or in rocky areas. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
