It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that display a range of vibrant colors, including shades of purple, pink, and white. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is the primary ornamental feature, making it a popular choice for garden displays.
