    "intro": "Cyclosorus roemerianus, commonly known as the Roemer's cyclosorus, is a rare and delicate fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, intricate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in circular formations, giving it its genus name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
