    "intro": "Crinum cortifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf crinum, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its strap-shaped, often broad leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in summer. Its bulbous rhizomes are an important feature for propagation and storage of nutrients. Crinum cortifolium is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils in full sun."
