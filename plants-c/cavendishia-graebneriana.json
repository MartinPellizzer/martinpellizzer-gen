It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that can range from red to orange and yellow, creating a dramatic visual display. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, supporting its epiphytic growth habit. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, emerging from the center of the leaf rosette. Cavendishia graebneriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
