    "intro": "Centromadia parryi var. australis, commonly known as the Australian centromadia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the southwestern region of Western Australia. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers during the cooler months. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
