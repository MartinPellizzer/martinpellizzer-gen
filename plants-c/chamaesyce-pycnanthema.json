It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It has a low, spreading growth habit with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture. Its flowers are clustered in cyathia, which are modified leaf-like structures that house the reproductive organs."
