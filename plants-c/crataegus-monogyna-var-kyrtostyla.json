    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna var. kyrtostyla, commonly known as the downy hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to lance-shaped leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun to partial shade. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
