The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in clusters, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom during the dry season. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by birds and insects, and the plant is often used in ornamental horticulture. The bark and leaves have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their purported health benefits."
