    "intro": "Cypripedium caudatum var. uropedium, commonly known as the long-tailed lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, pouch-like flower that is often pink or purple in color, with a long, slender spur. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often on rocky or wooded slopes. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single, showy flower per stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
