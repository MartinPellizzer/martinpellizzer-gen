It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters, featuring thorned branches and oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by small, red berries that are edible but often tart. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological and ornamental purposes in gardens and natural habitats."
