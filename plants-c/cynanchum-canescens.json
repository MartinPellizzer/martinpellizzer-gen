    "intro": "Cynanchum canescens, commonly known as the gray milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, woodlands, and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, upright stems that are covered in a fine, grayish pubescence. Its leaves are lanceolate, with a hairy surface and a distinct midrib, while its flowers are pale green to white, arranged in umbels. The plant is known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds and serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
