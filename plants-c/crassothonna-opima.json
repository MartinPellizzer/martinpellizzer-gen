    "intro": "Crassothonna opima, commonly known as the Natal grass or Natal flat sedge, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and riverbanks, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands. Crassothonna opima is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
