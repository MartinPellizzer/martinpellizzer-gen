    "intro": "Chytraculia bimarginata, commonly known as the two-margin fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves with a distinct marginal vein that gives it its common name. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Chytraculia bimarginata plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
