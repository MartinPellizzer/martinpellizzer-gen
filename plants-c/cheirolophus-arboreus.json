    "intro": "Cheirolophus arboreus, commonly known as the tree dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a herbaceous perennial that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, featuring a woody base and a rosette of leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
