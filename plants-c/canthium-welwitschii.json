    "intro": "Canthium welwitschii, commonly known as the welwitschii spurge, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by distinctive red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to access water from underground sources. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is often considered a keystone species in its native habitat."
