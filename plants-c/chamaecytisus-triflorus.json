It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters of three, giving it its scientific name. The plant has slender, woody stems that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, which is a characteristic feature of the genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal and rocky environments."
