    "intro": "Calycorectes ovigerus, commonly known as the ovigerous calycorectes, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its unique calyx structure, which is fused to the ovary, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are often brightly colored to attract pollinators. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a rough texture that aids in water retention. Calycorectes ovigerus is native to tropical regions and thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
