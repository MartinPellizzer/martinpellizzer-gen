This variant is a naturally occurring form of the Sargent cherry, characterized by its pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of 3 to 6 meters. The leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly serrated edge, and the fruit is a small, sweet cherry that ripens in late summer.
