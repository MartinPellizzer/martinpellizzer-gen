    "intro": "Cyperus prionotropis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, often found in wetlands and disturbed soils. The plant has grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and erect, with small, clustered flower heads that develop into three-angled berries. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively. Cyperus prionotropis is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its ability to thrive in moist conditions and its attractive foliage."
