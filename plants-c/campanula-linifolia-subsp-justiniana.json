    "intro": "Campanula linifolia subsp. justiniana, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving the plant a silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in alpine gardens."
