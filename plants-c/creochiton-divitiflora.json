    "intro": "Creochiton divitiflora, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, orange-pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that reduces water loss. Creochiton divitiflora thrives in warm, humid climates and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth."
