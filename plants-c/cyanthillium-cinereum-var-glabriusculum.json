    "intro": "Cyanthillium cinereum var. glabriusculum, commonly known as the silky blueweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its blue to purple flowers and gray-green, hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and the leaves are narrow and often covered in fine, silky hairs. This variety is distinguished by its reduced hairiness compared to the typical form, giving it a smoother appearance."
