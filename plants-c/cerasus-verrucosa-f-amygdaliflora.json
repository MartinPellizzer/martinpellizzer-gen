    "intro": "Cerasus verrucosa f. amygdaliflora, commonly known as the sweet cherry plum or dwarf cherry plum, is a compact, ornamental shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, oval leaves that are dark green and glossy, with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart red or yellow cherries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes. Its compact size and ornamental value make it a popular choice for hedging and container gardening."
