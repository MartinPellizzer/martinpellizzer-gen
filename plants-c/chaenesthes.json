    "intro": "Chaenesthes, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its terrestrial or epiphytic growth habit, often found in rocky or forested areas. The plants typically produce showy, fragrant flowers with intricate patterns that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Chaenesthes species are known for their specialized adaptations to nutrient-poor environments, including mycorrhizal associations. Their botanical significance lies in their role in ecological systems and their value in horticultural and scientific research."
