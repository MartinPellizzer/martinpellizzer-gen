    "intro": "Carex muricata var. divulsa, commonly known as the Divulsa sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and produces spikelets that are typically clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. The plant prefers moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, bogs, and the edges of ponds, and is often found in temperate regions. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, but the plant plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
