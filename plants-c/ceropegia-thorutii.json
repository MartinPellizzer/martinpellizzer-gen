    "intro": "Ceropegia thorutii, commonly known as the African violet or the Cape plume, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pale purple or white. The plant features succulent leaves that are often hairy and have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Ceropegia thorutii is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and ease of care."
