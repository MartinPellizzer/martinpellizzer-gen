    "intro": "Carex acuta subsp. colorata, commonly known as the pink sedge, is a perennial plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that range from dark green to reddish hues, especially in the autumn. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale pink to white flowers in the summer months. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its attractive foliage and ecological value, it is a popular choice for wetland gardens and conservation efforts."
