It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that are surrounded by green bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rough texture. Crepis macrocephala is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun."
