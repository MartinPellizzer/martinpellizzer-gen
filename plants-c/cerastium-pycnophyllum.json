    "intro": "Cerastium pycnophyllum, commonly known as the denseleaf mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its densely packed, small, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its compact growth and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
