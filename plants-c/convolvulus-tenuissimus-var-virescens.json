    "intro": "Convolvulus tenuissimus var. virescens, commonly known as the creeping blueweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, with five petals and a prominent, slender tube. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as gravelly soils and disturbed areas. It is often considered a weed but has some ornamental value due to its delicate appearance."
