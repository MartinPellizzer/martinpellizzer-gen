    "intro": "Caesia alpina, commonly known as the alpine caesia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other umbellifers, while its flowers form small, clustered umbels. Caesia alpina is often found in meadows and slopes at high altitudes, where it contributes to the biodiversity of alpine ecosystems."
