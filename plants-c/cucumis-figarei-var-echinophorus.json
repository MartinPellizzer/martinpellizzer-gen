    "intro": "Cucumis figarei var. echinophorus, commonly known as the spiny cucumber, is a variant of the genus Cucumis native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rough, spiny skin and elongated, cucurbit-like fruits. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous vine with tendrils that help it climb or trail along the ground. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, a common trait in the Cucumis genus. The fruit, while edible, is less commonly cultivated compared to other cucumber species due to its unique texture and flavor profile."
