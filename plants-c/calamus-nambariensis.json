    "intro": "Calamus nambariensis, commonly known as the Nambari reed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae. It is native to the wet tropical forests of northern Australia, particularly in Queensland. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and pinnate leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in panicles, which are typically pollinated by insects. Calamus nambariensis is often used by Indigenous communities for its strong, flexible stems, which are woven into baskets and other traditional crafts."
