    "intro": "Carex asperula, commonly known as rough sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to brown in color, with male and female flowers usually occurring on separate spikes. Native to various regions of North America, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and shaded woodlands. Carex asperula is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
