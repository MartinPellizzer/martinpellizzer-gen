    "intro": "Carex atlantica, commonly known as Atlantic sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like flower clusters that bloom in the summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Carex atlantica plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various wildlife species."
