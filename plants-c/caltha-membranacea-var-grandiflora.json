    "intro": "Caltha membranacea var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered marsh marigold, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features bright yellow, showy flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a waxy surface, adapted to waterlogged soils. Its rhizomatous root system helps it thrive in moist environments, and it is often found in marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance in riparian zones."
