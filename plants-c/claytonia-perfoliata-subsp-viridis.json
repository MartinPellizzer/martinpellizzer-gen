    "intro": "Claytonia perfoliata subsp. viridis, commonly known as green leaf springbeauty, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features basal leaves that are typically green, with a rosette structure that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. Its leaves are often described as succulent, which aids in water storage in arid environments. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
