It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and have a distinctive blue or violet coloration. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually purple or blue, arranged in clusters at the top of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late summer into autumn."
