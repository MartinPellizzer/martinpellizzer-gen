    "intro": "Cicuta perennans, commonly known as the water hemlock, is a toxic perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant contains potent toxins, including cicutoxin, which can be lethal to humans and animals if ingested. It typically grows in wet, disturbed soils along stream banks and in marshy areas. Due to its high toxicity, it is often considered a noxious weed in agricultural and natural settings."
