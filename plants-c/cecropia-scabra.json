    "intro": "Cecropia scabra, commonly known as the rough cecropia, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, often whitish bark and long, pinnate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by winged fruits that disperse seeds by wind. It is often found in disturbed habitats and is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Cecropia scabra plays an important ecological role in providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
