It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, thriving in sandy or rocky soils with ample sunlight. It has fleshy, succulent leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds.
