    "intro": "Calamus brevissimus, commonly known as the short-stemmed arrowroot, is a member of the Aroid family (Araceae). It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its short, thick rhizomes and broad, sword-shaped leaves. Native to tropical regions of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Its rhizomes are valued for their starchy content, similar to arrowroot, making it an important plant in some local economies."
