    "intro": "Chamaerops humilis var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-tipped date palm, is a variety of the date palm native to the Mediterranean region. It is a small, shrub-like palm with slender, unbranched stems that often grow close to the ground. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture that distinguishes it from other varieties. It produces small, clustered inflorescences that develop into date-like fruits, though these are not typically edible. This plant is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping."
