    "intro": "Ctenopteris flabelliformis, commonly known as the fan-leaf sea palm, is a species of fern native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of small, scale-like structures. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments, typically growing along rocky shores or in tidal zones. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to anchor itself in challenging coastal substrates. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and are also appreciated for their ornamental value in aquatic gardens."
