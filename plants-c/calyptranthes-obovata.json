    "intro": "Calyptranthes obovata, commonly known as the broad-leaf calyptranthes, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It features opposite, ovate to obovate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green, with a smooth margin. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in terminal clusters, which bloom throughout the year in some regions. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Calyptranthes obovata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in warm, humid climates."
