    "intro": "Ctenitis seramensis, commonly known as the Seram ctenitis, is a rare fern species native to the island of Seram in Indonesia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited geographic range and habitat specificity, Ctenitis seramensis is considered a vulnerable species."
