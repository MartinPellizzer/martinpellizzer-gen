The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. This plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
