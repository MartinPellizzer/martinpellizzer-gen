It consists of a single species, Cyathostyle latifolia, which is native to the southeastern United States. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. It produces smooth, elongated fruits called achenes, which are enclosed in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. Cyathostyles is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
