It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically narrow and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces striking, bright yellow or orange flowers that are clustered in racemes, adding vibrant color to its habitat. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation. Caesalpinia brevifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and showy blooms."
