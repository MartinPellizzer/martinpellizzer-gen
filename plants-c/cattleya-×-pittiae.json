    "intro": "Cattleya \u00d7 pittiae, commonly known as the Pittia Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid prized for its vibrant, fragrant flowers. It originates from a cross between Cattleya mossiae and Cattleya pumila, resulting in a plant with strong stems and large, showy blooms. The flowers typically display a combination of yellow and red hues, often with a contrasting lip. This orchid thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
