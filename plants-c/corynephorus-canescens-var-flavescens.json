    "intro": "Corynephorus canescens var. flavescens, commonly known as the golden sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green to golden-colored foliage, which becomes more pronounced in sunlight. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize sandy soils in landscaping and restoration projects."
