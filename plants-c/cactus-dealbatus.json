    "intro": "Cactus dealbatus, commonly known as the white cactus or the Mexican white cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of white, tubular flowers that bloom during the summer months. Its stems are covered in a whitish, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy succulent suitable for xeriscaping."
