It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. It is a hardy shrub or small tree that can grow up to several meters in height. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
