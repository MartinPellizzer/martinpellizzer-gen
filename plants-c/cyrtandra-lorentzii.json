It is a shrub characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves and small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
