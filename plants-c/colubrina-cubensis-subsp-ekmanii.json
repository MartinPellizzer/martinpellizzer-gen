    "intro": "Colubrina cubensis subsp. ekmanii, commonly known as the Cuban colubrina, is a shrub native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and the Isle of Pines. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
