    "intro": "Cissus penninervis, commonly known as the rock fig or devil's backbone, is a tropical climbing plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, segmented stems that often have a woody texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are yellow when ripe. Its roots are known to exude a sticky substance that helps it adhere to surfaces. Cissus penninervis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
