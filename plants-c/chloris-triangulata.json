    "intro": "Chloris triangulata, commonly known as the triangular grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-lobed seed heads that are distinctive in appearance. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it an effective ground cover. Chloris triangulata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping."
