    "intro": "Caladenia applanata, commonly known as the flat-leaf spider-orchid, is an endemic orchid species native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and pale green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The flowers are small, with a distinctive spider-like appearance, featuring a narrow, elongated labellum. It blooms during the autumn season, typically from September to November, and is adapted to grow in sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
