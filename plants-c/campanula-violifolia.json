    "intro": "Campanula violifolia, commonly known as the violet bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, violet to blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
