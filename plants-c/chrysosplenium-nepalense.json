    "intro": "Chrysosplenium nepalense, commonly known as the Nepal golden spleenwort, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Saxifragaceae family. It is native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal, India, and Bhutan, typically growing in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features small, delicate leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers during the spring and early summer. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for studies on alpine flora and plant adaptation to high-altitude conditions. Chrysosplenium nepalense is also noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
