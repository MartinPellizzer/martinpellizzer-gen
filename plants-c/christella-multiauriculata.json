It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has heart-shaped leaves with distinctive auriculate (ear-like) lobes at the base. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a unique appearance. Christella multiauriculata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
