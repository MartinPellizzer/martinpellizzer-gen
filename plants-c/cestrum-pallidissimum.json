    "intro": "Cestrum pallidissimum, commonly known as the pale cestrum, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in the evening. These flowers are pollinated primarily by moths, making it a nocturnal bloomer. Its ornamental value is appreciated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
