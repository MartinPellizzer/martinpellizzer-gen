    "intro": "Convolvulus terminalis, commonly known as the trailing morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves and tends to sprawl along the ground, forming dense mats. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and containers. The flowers bloom in the early morning and close by midday, hence its common name."
