It features small, hairy, oval leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant. The flowers are white or pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens, and they bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in gardens. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
