It is characterized by its milky latex sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow to orange. Its flowers are typically followed by follicles that release seeds with silky hairs. This species is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient plant in harsh environments."
