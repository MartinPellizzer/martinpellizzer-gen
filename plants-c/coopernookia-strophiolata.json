    "intro": "Coopernookia strophiolata, commonly known as the spiralleaf orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its unique spiral-shaped leaves, which give it its common name and contribute to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires specific humidity and temperature conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
