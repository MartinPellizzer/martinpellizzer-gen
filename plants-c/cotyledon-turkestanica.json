It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and orange during the growing season. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to thrive. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
