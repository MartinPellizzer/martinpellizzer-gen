    "intro": "Calamagrostis cephalantha var. humillima, commonly known as the dwarf bluejoint grass, is a compact, clump-forming perennial grass native to North America. It features narrow, blue-green leaves that are slightly hairy and often have a silvery-blue hue under certain lighting conditions. The plant produces panicles of small, greenish-brown flowers in late summer, which are often overlooked but contribute to its ecological value. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other riparian habitats. This variety is distinguished by its smaller size compared to other Calamagrostis species, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces."
