    "intro": "Campanula bergiana, commonly known as the Bergian bellflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Campanula bergiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
