    "intro": "Coccoloba ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty coccoloba, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is a small shrub or subshrub that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown stems and leaves that are often covered in a fine, rusty-colored pubescence. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in racemes and bloom during the warmer months. Coccoloba ferruginea is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in coastal areas due to its tolerance for saline conditions."
