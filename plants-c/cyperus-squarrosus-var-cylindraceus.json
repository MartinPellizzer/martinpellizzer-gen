    "intro": "Cyperus squarrosus var. cylindraceus, commonly known as the cylindrical flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and floodplains, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant features slender, grass-like stems that often form dense clumps, with narrow, linear leaves that are usually pale green in color. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in clusters, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variant is distinguished by its cylindrical, swollen base and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
