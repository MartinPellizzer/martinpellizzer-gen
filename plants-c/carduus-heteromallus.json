    "intro": "Carduus heteromallus, commonly known as the nodding thistle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and spiny leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces purple to pink flower heads that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while the flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets. Carduus heteromallus is often found in dry grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
