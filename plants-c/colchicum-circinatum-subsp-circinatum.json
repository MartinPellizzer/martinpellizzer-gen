    "intro": "Colchicum circinatum subsp. circinatum, commonly known as the circling colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a single, erect stem with large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, white down. Its bulbs are toxic and contain colchicine, a compound used in medicine. This subspecies is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils."
