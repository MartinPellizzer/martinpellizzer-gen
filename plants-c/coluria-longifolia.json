It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are typically pubescent, with a rough texture, and the plant is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Coluria longifolia is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive foliage and resilience to harsh conditions."
