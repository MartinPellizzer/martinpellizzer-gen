    "intro": "Carduus pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in dry, disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils make it both a garden plant and a weed."
