    "intro": "Carelia agrianthus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round, red fruits that contain a single seed. It is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Carelia agrianthus is now considered an endangered species."
