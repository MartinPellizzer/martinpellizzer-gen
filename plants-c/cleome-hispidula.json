    "intro": "Cleome hispidula, commonly known as spider flower, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant is a herbaceous annual or perennial, depending on the climate, and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Cleome hispidula is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in ecological gardens to attract pollinators."
