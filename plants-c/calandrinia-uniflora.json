    "intro": "Calandrinia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower portulaca, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent leaves and vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant thrives in hot, arid environments and is adapted to poor soil conditions, making it a hardy species. Its flowers are usually solitary, opening in the morning and closing by midday, a trait known as nyctinasty. Calandrinia uniflora is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
