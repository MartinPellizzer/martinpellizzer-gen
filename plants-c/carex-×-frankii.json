    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 frankii, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and stream banks. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Carex acutata and Carex lyngbyei. Its ability to thrive in wet environments makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
