It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and stream sides. It has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
