    "intro": "Convolvulus serpens, commonly known as the serpentine bindweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial herb that produces small, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white. The plant has creeping stems that can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively in suitable habitats. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a hairy texture. Convolvulus serpens thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in disturbed areas and along roadsides."
