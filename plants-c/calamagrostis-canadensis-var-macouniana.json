    "intro": "Calamagrostis canadensis var. macouniana, commonly known as Macoun's reedgrass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender culms and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
