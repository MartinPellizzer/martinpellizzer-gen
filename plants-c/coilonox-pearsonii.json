    "intro": "Coilonox pearsonii, commonly known as the pearsonii coilonox, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its striking, spiky inflorescence and vibrant, colorful bracts that attract pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
