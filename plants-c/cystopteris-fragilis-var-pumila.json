    "intro": "Cystopteris fragilis var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf brittle fern, is a small, delicate fern native to North America. It features finely divided, pinnately arranged fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread readily. The fronds are characterized by their fragile, papery texture and a distinctive, finely toothed margin."
