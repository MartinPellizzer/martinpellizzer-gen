    "intro": "Centaurea aspera subsp. euaspera, commonly known as the rough centaury, is a flowering plant species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and slender, branched stems that bear clusters of small, bright yellow to orange-red flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered with fine hairs, giving the plant a rough texture. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and long blooming period."
