    "intro": "Calamagrostis stricta var. aculeolata, commonly known as the slender false sweetgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage. The plant produces feathery, plume-like inflorescences that add ornamental value in late summer and autumn. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its dense growth makes it an effective erosion control plant in riparian areas."
