    "intro": "Capnogonium, commonly known as the \"spiny bladderworts,\" is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, often submerged or floating leaves and specialized structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. Capnogonium species are typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. They are carnivorous, relying on the bladders to capture and digest prey for nutrients. The genus includes several species, each adapted to different aquatic habitats and light conditions."
