    "intro": "Cycas segmentifida, commonly known as the segmented cycas, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are deeply divided. The leaves are typically green and can reach lengths of up to 3 meters, giving the plant a dramatic appearance. Cycas segmentifida produces cones, with male cones clustered at the base of the plant and female cones emerging from the trunk. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is considered a living fossil due to its ancient lineage."
