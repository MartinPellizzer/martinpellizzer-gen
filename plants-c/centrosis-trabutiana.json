    "intro": "Centrosis trabutiana, commonly known as the Trabut's centrose, is a rare flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Centrosis trabutiana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
