It is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its stems are often covered in fine, white pubescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in greenhouses or as a houseplant. Columnea carinata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
