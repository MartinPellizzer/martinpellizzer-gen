    "intro": "Cybianthus macrophyllus, commonly known as the giant white heath, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its large, waxy, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dense, dark green foliage with leathery leaves that provide a striking contrast to its showy blooms. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Cybianthus macrophyllus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
