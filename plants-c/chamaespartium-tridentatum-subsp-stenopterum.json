    "intro": "Chamaespartium tridentatum subsp. stenopterum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fritillary, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically narrow and trifoliate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or alpine meadows. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Fritillariaceae family."
