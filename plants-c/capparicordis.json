It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The fruit, a small capsule, contains several seeds that are dispersed by wind."
