It is native to the high-altitude regions of Madagascar, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces small, red berries that contain its seeds, which are used for coffee production. It is characterized by its delicate, aromatic leaves and compact growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Coffea capuronii is considered a rare and endangered species."
