    "intro": "Corylopsis himalayana var. himalayana, commonly known as the Himalayan flame-twig, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its bright orange to red flowers that appear in late winter or early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has slender, arching branches covered with small, scale-like leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vivid floral display and hardy nature in temperate climates."
