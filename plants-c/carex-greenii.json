    "intro": "Carex greenii, commonly known as Green's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences, which are typical of the sedge family. Native to North America, particularly the eastern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like foliage that is often bright green, and its flowering structures are usually small and inconspicuous. Carex greenii plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
