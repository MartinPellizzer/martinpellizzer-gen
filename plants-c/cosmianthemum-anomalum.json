    "intro": "Cosmianthemum anomalum, commonly known as the mountain starflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow, typically during the summer months. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Cosmianthemum anomalum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific climate requirements."
