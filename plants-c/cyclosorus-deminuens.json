    "intro": "Cyclosorus deminuens, commonly known as the diminutive cyclosorus, is a small, perennial fern native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or marshy areas. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
