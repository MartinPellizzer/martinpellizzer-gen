    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The leaves are typically narrow, leathery, and covered in fine, short hairs, giving the plant its \"pubescent\" designation. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and moorlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide habitat for various wildlife species."
