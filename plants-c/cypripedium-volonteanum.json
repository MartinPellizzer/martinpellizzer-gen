    "intro": "Cypripedium volonteanum, commonly known as the Voltaire's lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its native range."
