    "intro": "Cynanchum hastifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access moisture from lower soil layers. Its chemical composition includes various alkaloids, which have been studied for potential medicinal properties."
