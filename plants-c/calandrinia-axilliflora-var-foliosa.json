The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features include opposite, ovate leaves and a compact growth habit that helps it conserve water."
