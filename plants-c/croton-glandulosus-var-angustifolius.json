It features simple, alternate leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a distinctive reddish or purple hue on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually yellow or orange in color, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It has glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which contribute to its characteristic appearance and aid in water retention. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained, sandy soils."
