    "intro": "Cuscuta jepsonii, commonly known as the Jepson dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants. The plant is native to California and is often found growing on various shrubs and grasses. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it can thrive in a range of environmental conditions. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host plants if left unchecked."
