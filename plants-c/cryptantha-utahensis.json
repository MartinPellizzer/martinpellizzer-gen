It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It has a compact growth habit with hairy stems and leaves that help reduce water loss. Cryptantha utahensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and provides nectar for pollinators."
