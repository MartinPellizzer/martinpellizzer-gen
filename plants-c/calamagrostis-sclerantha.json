    "intro": "Calamagrostis sclerantha, commonly known as the rigid reedgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. Calamagrostis sclerantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting wetland biodiversity."
