    "intro": "Celmisia, commonly known as the New Zealand flax or mountain flax, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to New Zealand and are characterized by their narrow, grass-like leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers. Celmisia species often grow in alpine or subalpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in native habitats. Some species are also used in traditional M\u0101ori practices and horticulture."
