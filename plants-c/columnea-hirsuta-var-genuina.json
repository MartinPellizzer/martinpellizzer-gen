    "intro": "Columnea hirsuta var. genuina, commonly known as the velvet tangle or red velvet plant, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of small, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it suitable for indoor cultivation. Its unique appearance and compact growth habit make it a popular choice for container gardening. The varietal name 'genuina' refers to its distinctiveness from the typical form of Columnea hirsuta."
