    "intro": "Carex thyrsiflora, commonly known as the thrysoflora sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like clusters of small, greenish flowers. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. Carex thyrsiflora is a valuable component of native plant gardens and ecological landscapes."
