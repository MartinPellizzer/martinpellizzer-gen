It is a low-growing perennial with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
