    "intro": "Colysis elliptica var. pentaphylla, commonly known as the five-leafed colysis, is a unique variant of the colysis plant. It is characterized by its elliptical-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a distinctive five-leaf pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its foliage is usually a deep green, with a slightly waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic and ecological significance."
