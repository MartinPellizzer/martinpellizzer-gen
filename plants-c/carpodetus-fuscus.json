It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and opposite, elliptical leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by cone-like fruits that contain winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and mountainous regions. Carpodetus fuscus plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and stabilizing stream banks."
