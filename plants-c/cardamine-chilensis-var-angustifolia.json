    "intro": "Cardamine chilensis var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved watercress, is a perennial herb native to South America, particularly Chile. It features a basal rosette of slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor similar to other watercress species. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in streambanks and wet meadows."
