    "intro": "Cirsium edule var. wenatchense, commonly known as Wenatchee thistle, is a perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. It has been historically used by Indigenous peoples for its edible young shoots and leaves. However, due to its thorny nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
