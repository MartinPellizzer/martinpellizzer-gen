    "intro": "Callitris actinostrobus, commonly known as the river red gum, is a species of coniferous tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its straight, often buttressed trunk and its distinctive, narrow, needle-like leaves. The tree produces small, scale-like cones that contain seeds, and it is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species. The bark of Callitris actinostrobus is often fissured and can vary in color from reddish-brown to greyish-white."
