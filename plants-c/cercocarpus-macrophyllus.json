    "intro": "Cercocarpus macrophyllus, commonly known as the Sierra Madre buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 leaflets, and its small, reddish-brown flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, woody fruits called nuts, which are enclosed in a spiny calyx. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in arid landscapes."
