It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The variety bispicata is distinguished by its two distinct spikelets, which contribute to its ornamental value in garden settings."
