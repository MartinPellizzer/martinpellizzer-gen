    "intro": "Cylindropuntia acanthocarpa subsp. thornberi, commonly known as Thornberg's barrel cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, and it has spines that are often shorter and more clustered than in other cacti of the same genus. It is drought-tolerant and adapted to arid environments, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping. The subspecies is distinguished by its unique morphology and geographic distribution within the Cylindropuntia genus."
