    "intro": "Celastrus verticillatus, commonly known as the whorled-clethra, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, elliptic leaves that are often arranged in whorls, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant fall foliage and persistent berries."
