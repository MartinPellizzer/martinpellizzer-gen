    "intro": "Combretum ellipticum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf combretum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its elliptical, narrow leaves that are often slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Combretum ellipticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
