    "intro": "Cheirolophus uliginosus, commonly known as the marsh bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in areas with high moisture levels. The plant features showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
