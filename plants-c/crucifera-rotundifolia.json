    "intro": "Crucifera rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leafed crucifer, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its round or kidney-shaped leaves and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its flowers are designed for cross-pollination, and the plant produces small, round pods containing several seeds. It plays a role in supporting local insect populations and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to wet habitats."
