    "intro": "Cousinia laetevirens, commonly known as the cheerful green cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features upright, hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cousinia laetevirens is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
