    "intro": "Calycosia, commonly known as the golden groundsel, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that typically feature yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. Calycosia species are native to various regions of the Americas, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. They often grow in open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in horticulture for their ornamental value."
