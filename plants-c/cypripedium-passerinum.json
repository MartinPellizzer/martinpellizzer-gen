    "intro": "Cypripedium passerinum, commonly known as the showy lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, pinkish-purple pouch-shaped lip that resembles a slipper, which is a unique adaptation for attracting pollinators. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in shaded forest environments, often near streams or in bogs. It produces a single, showy flower with a greenish-yellow dorsal sepal and a white or pink lateral sepal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species in many areas."
