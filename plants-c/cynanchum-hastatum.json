    "intro": "Cynanchum hastatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes other milkweeds, and is characterized by its slender stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its latex sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores. Cynanchum hastatum is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
