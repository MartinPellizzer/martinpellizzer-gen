    "intro": "Carex foenea var. tuberculata, commonly known as the tuberculate sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, cylindrical leaves. The plant produces spikes of small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is noted for its distinctive tuberculate (knobbed) nodes on its stems, which contribute to its unique botanical identity."
