    "intro": "Chenopodium \u00d7 fallax, commonly known as wild spinach, is a hybrid species belonging to the Amaranthaceae family. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as bloom. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is typically found in disturbed soils and thrives in full sun, making it a common weed in agricultural fields. Its leaves are edible and have been used in traditional cuisines, though they may contain oxalic acid, which can be harmful in large quantities."
