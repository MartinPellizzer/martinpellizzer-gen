    "intro": "Cakile maritima var. baltica, commonly known as Baltic sea rocket, is a perennial plant native to the coastal regions of the Baltic Sea. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and pinnately compound leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by triangular, beak-like fruits. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune environments and coastal marshes. This variety is adapted to withstand harsh maritime conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
