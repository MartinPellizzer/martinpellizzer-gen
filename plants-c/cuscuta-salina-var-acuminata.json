    "intro": "Cuscuta salina var. acuminata, commonly known as salt marsh dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It is typically found in coastal areas and saline environments, where it attaches to grasses and other herbaceous plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, thread-like appearance due to its lack of true stems and leaves. It plays a role in ecological systems by influencing the growth of its host plants and serving as a food source for certain insects. Due to its specialized adaptations, it is an important indicator species for salt-affected habitats."
