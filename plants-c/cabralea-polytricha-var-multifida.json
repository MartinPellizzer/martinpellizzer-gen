It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with deeply lobed leaves that give it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white and pink, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its unique leaf structure and ornamental value make it a popular choice for horticultural collections. The species is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil."
