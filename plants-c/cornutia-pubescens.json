    "intro": "Cornutia pubescens, commonly known as the hairy cornutia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the Andes mountains of South America, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its high-altitude habitat. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are typically pink or purple, and they bloom in the spring. Cornutia pubescens is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native region."
