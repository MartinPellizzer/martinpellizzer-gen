    "intro": "Chlorospatha amalfiensis, commonly known as the Amalfi Greenleaf, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Italy. It is characterized by its striking, waxy leaves that range in color from bright green to pale yellow. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring. Its growth habit is low and spreading, with a preference for well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected natural reserves."
