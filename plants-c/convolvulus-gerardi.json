    "intro": "Convolvulus gerardi, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is a trailing or climbing annual herb with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and bloom in the early morning. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry environments. Its rapid growth and ability to spread make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed."
