    "intro": "Carlina alpina, commonly known as Alpine cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, thriving in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant features a rosette of silver-gray leaves and produces tall, sparsely branched stems topped with blue to purple composite flowers. Its flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. Carlina alpina is adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude meadows and tundra regions."
