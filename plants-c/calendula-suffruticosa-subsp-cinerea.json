    "intro": "Calendula suffruticosa subsp. cinerea, commonly known as grayleaf marigold, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy foliage and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The subspecies is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has mild medicinal properties."
