    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 latifolia, commonly known as the papeda or desert citron, is a hybrid citrus plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves and small, yellowish-green fruits that are typically not consumed by humans but are used in traditional medicine. The plant is highly cold-tolerant, making it suitable for cultivation in cooler climates compared to other citrus species. Its flowers are fragrant and can be used in perfumery. The fruit's peel contains essential oils and is often used in aromatherapy and as a source of citric acid."
