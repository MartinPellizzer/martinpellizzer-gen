    "intro": "Coronilla minima var. fruticans, commonly known as the creeping crown vetch, is a low-growing perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, pea-like flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces small, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. It is often used in erosion control due to its dense, mat-forming growth habit. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it beneficial for soil enrichment in agricultural and restoration settings."
