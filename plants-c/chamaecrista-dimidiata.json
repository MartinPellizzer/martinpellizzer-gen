    "intro": "Chamaecrista dimidiata, commonly known as the half-leaf burr legume, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often divided into two unequal parts, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers arranged in racemes, followed by distinctive, spiny pods that contain the seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry forests. Chamaecrista dimidiata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has also been used in traditional medicine."
