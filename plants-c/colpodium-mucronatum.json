    "intro": "Colpodium mucronatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its simple, leaf-like structures that are often mistaken for true leaves, though they are actually modified stems. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, where it anchors itself to substrates with its root-like structures. It produces small, bladder-like structures that can trap small aquatic organisms, contributing to its role as a carnivorous plant. Its presence is an indicator of clean, well-oxygenated water in its native habitats."
