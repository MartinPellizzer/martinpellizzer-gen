    "intro": "Callitriche sessilis var. confervoides, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has small, opposite, oval leaves that are often submerged, with a smooth, waxy surface. It produces tiny, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often found in association with other aquatic vegetation. This variant is distinguished by its compact growth habit and resemblance to other aquatic algae."
