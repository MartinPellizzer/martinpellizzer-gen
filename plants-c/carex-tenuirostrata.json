    "intro": "Carex tenuirostrata, commonly known as narrow-beaked sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. This plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are slender and grass-like, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, clustered flowers in late spring to early summer. Carex tenuirostrata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
