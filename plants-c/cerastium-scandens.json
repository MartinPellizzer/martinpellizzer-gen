    "intro": "Cerastium scandens, commonly known as creeping snowberry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features prostrate or trailing stems that can spread up to several feet, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Cerastium scandens is often used in horticulture for ground cover due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
