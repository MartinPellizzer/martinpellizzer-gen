    "intro": "Corylus americana f. humilis, commonly known as the American hazelnut dwarf form, is a compact variant of the American hazelnut. It is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States, characterized by its smaller size and dense growth habit. The plant produces small, edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, which are typically harvested in the fall. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in autumn. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in native plant gardens."
