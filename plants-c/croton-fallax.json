    "intro": "Croton fallax, commonly known as the dwarf croton, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage with shades of green, yellow, and red, which adds visual interest to gardens. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, followed by woody, spiny capsules containing seeds. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is widely appreciated in horticulture."
