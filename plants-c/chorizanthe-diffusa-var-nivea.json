    "intro": "Chorizanthe diffusa var. nivea, commonly known as white chori, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats such as deserts and coastal dunes. It is an annual plant that produces small, bead-like fruits called utricles, which contain the seeds. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to arid environments and it is often found in disturbed or dry soils."
