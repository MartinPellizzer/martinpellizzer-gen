    "intro": "Crocus harpkeae, commonly known as the Harpke's crocus, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive yellow center, which bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its bulbs are small and adapted to survive harsh alpine conditions, and it is closely related to other members of the Crocusspecies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human activity."
