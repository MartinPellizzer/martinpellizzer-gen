    "intro": "Coriandrum sativum subsp. asiaticum, commonly known as Chinese coriander or cilantro, is a herbaceous annual plant native to southern Asia. It features feathery, finely divided leaves and small white or pink flowers that bloom in umbels. The plant produces small, spherical fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts when mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its aromatic leaves and seeds. The subspecies is closely related to the common coriander but is distinguished by its distinct flavor and appearance."
