    "intro": "Cyperus compactus, commonly known as compact spikerush, is a flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to brown flowers. Its rhizomes help it spread and establish dense colonies in wet soil. Cyperus compactus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
