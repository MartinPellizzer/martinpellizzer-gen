    "intro": "Cousinia lachnosphaera, commonly known as the woolly cushion flower, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosettes of silver-gray, woolly foliage. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and alpine habitats. Cousinia lachnosphaera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
