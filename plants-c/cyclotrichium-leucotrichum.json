It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Cyclotrichium leucotrichum is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a short-lived perennial."
