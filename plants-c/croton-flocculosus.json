    "intro": "Croton flocculosus, commonly known as the woolly croton, is a striking plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are covered in dense, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
