    "intro": "Corydalis wandoensis, commonly known as the Wando Corydalis, is a flowering plant native to South Korea. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple. The plant grows in rocky or shaded areas, often in mountainous regions, and has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
