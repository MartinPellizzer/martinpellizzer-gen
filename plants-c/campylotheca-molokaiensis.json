It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to the dry, coastal environments of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique botanical species."
