    "intro": "Corydalis curviflora var. trifida, commonly known as the three-lobed corydalis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It features slender, creeping stems that produce clusters of delicate, spurred flowers in shades of pink and purple. The leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, which is a distinguishing characteristic of this variety. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or rocky habitats. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
