    "intro": "Cyanus pinardii, commonly known as the \"blueweed\" or \"blue thistle,\" is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has a rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowering stems are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, spiky bracts beneath the flower heads. Cyanus pinardii is typically found in rocky soils and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its vibrant color and drought tolerance."
