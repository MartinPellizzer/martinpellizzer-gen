    "intro": "Cephalaria melanolepis, commonly known as black-leaved cephalaria, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dark green, almost black leaves that are densely covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges or grassy slopes. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
