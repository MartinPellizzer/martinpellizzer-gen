It belongs to the family Cleistaceae, which is characterized by its unique, closed flowers that open only briefly. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are pollinated by flies rather than bees. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs. Cleistes tenuis thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks."
