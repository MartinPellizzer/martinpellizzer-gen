    "intro": "Chione buxifolia, commonly known as the waxleaf buxus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, glossy, dark green foliage that remains largely unblemished throughout the year. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the late spring and early summer. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements. Chione buxifolia thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for garden borders or container planting."
