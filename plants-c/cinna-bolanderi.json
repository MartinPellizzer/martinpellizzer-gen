    "intro": "Cinna bolanderi, commonly known as Bolander's cinnamon fern, is a perennial fern native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender, arching fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant has a distinctive, cinnamon-colored fertile frond that contrasts with its sterile, light green fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Cinna bolanderi is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
