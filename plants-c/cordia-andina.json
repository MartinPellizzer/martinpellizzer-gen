    "intro": "Cordia andina, commonly known as Andean cordia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release small, round seeds. Cordia andina is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the harsh conditions of high-altitude environments."
