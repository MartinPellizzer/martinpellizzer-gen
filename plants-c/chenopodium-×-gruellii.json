    "intro": "Chenopodium \u00d7 gruellii, commonly known as the desert goosefoot, is a hybrid plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant has alternate, broadly ovate to rhombic leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in dense, greenish-white inflorescences, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind. Chenopodium \u00d7 gruellii is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability, making it a resilient species in harsh desert conditions."
