It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic and medicinal plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in mountainous areas with a temperate climate. Its leaves are compound, with a distinctive fern-like appearance, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbel-like clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
