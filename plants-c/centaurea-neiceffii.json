    "intro": "Centaurea neiceffii, commonly known as the Armenian knapweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, featuring erect, branching stems covered in fine hairs. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, while its inflorescence is a dense cluster of bright yellow to orange-red flowers with bracts. The plant produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution in rocky and arid habitats. It is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
