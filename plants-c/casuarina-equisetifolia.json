    "intro": "Casuarina equisetifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved she-oak, is a deciduous evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, needle-like leaves that are arranged in clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often forming dense thickets. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate salt spray make it a common species in coastal landscapes."
