    "intro": "Carex wiegandii, commonly known as the Wiegand's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Central America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist to wet soil conditions. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces tiny flowers that are wind-pollinated. Carex wiegandii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
