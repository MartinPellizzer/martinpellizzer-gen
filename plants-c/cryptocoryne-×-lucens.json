    "intro": "Cryptocoryne \u00d7 lucens, commonly known as the hybrid cryptocoryne, is a popular aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a hybrid between Cryptocoryne balansae and Cryptocoryne wrightii, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 20 cm in length, often with a waxy texture and a distinct midrib. It thrives in low to moderate light conditions and requires stable water parameters to prevent stress and leaf decay. Cryptocoryne \u00d7 lucens is valued in aquariums for its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
