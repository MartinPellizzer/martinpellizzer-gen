    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris odontophylla, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features alternate, oval-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and small white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, round seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its rapid spread. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed with ecological and historical significance."
