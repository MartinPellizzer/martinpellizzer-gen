    "intro": "Chaerophyllum sylvestre, commonly known as wild angelica, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland areas and thrives in partial shade. Its tall, slender stems can reach up to 1 meter in height, and it produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used historically in herbal remedies."
