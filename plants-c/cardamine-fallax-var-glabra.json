    "intro": "Cardamine fallax var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth water crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are alternate along the stem. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in dense, terminal clusters during the spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize wetlands and streambanks. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
