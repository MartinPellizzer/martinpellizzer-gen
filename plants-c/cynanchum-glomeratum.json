    "intro": "Cynanchum glomeratum, commonly known as the clustered milkweed, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in umbels, which are followed by follicles containing seeds with silky hairs. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Cynanchum glomeratum is notable for its latex-like milky sap, which can be toxic to livestock and humans."
