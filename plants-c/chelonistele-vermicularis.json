It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
