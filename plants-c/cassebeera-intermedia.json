    "intro": "Cassebeera intermedia, commonly known as the red candelabra plant, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its branched, tree-like structure with long, slender leaves that are often red or purple in color. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its striking appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and greenhouses."
