    "intro": "Coryphantha obscura, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, solitary plant with a short, cylindrical stem that often appears pale or bluish-green. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short, lateral stems. Coryphantha obscura is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It is often found in rocky soils and is a popular plant among cactus enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
