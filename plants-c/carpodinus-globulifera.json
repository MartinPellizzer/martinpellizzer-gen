It is characterized by its spiny, globular-shaped heads composed of numerous small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of xerophytic plants."
