    "intro": "Callipteris matamensis, commonly known as Matamense palmetto, is a species of palm native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands. It is a small, cold-tolerant palm that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk and produces fan-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional thatching. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces edible fruits that are consumed by both wildlife and humans. Callipteris matamensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various species."
