    "intro": "Cladrastis albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces showy, pendulous clusters of white flowers in early spring, which are followed by long, bean-like pods. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant. Cladrastis albiflora is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
