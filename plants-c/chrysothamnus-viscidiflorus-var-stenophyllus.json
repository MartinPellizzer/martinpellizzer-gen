It is characterized by its yellowish-green foliage and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has sticky, glandular hairs on its leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
