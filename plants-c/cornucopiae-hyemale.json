    "intro": "Cornucopiae hyemale, commonly known as the golden hornet plant, is a rare flowering species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow and orange inflorescences that resemble a hornet's nest, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often with a slight waxy coating. The flowers emit a subtle, sweet fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
