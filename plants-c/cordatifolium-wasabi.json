    "intro": "Cordatifolium wasabi, commonly known as Japanese wasabi, is a perennial plant native to the mountain streams of Japan. It has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by oval, green pods containing the edible rhizome. The rhizome is prized for its pungent flavor and is used in Japanese cuisine, particularly with raw fish. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
