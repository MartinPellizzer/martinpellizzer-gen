    "intro": "Centaurea arachnoidea subsp. montis-ferrati, commonly known as the Alpine centaury, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces achene fruits with pappus bristles for wind dispersal. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This subspecies is often found in mountainous areas, including parts of the Alps and Carpathians."
