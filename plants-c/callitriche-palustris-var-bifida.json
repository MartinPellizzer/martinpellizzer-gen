    "intro": "Callitriche palustris var. bifida, commonly known as the twin-leaf water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to wetlands and shallow water environments. It features slender, floating stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often split into two lobes, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months, typically in clusters at the water's surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats and is often found in ponds, ditches, and marshes. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
