    "intro": "Cassuvium forstenii, commonly known as the Forsten's cassuvium, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged leaves that exhibit a striking variegation pattern. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the wet season. Cassuvium forstenii thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in dense tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
