It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Native to moist, temperate regions, it thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its ecological importance lies in providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
