    "intro": "Crocus biflorus var. adami, commonly known as the Adam's crocus, is a species of flowering plant in the iris family. It is native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and is characterized by its delicate, early spring blooms. The plant produces two to three narrow, grass-like leaves and has showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, or orange. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
