    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris bremensis, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white flowers with five petals and hairy, alternate leaves that are oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces small, round seeds enclosed in a three-lobed capsule, which is a characteristic feature of the genus Capsella. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments."
