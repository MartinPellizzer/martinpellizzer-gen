    "intro": "Cereus superbus, commonly known as the giant night-blooming cereus, is a striking cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and spiny, ribbed structure, which help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting moths and other nocturnal pollinators. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. Cereus superbus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming habit."
