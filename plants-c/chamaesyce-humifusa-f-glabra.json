    "intro": "Chamaesyce humifusa f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the southeastern United States. It features small, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, though the 'glabra' form is hairless. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are often succulent and can store water, aiding in its survival in dry, sandy soils. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed areas."
