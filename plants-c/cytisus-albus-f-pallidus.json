    "intro": "Cytisus albus f. pallidus, commonly known as the pale broom, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a shrub characterized by its slender, often spindly stems and small, pale yellow to white flowers. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with three small, oval-shaped leaflets. This variety is notable for its reduced floral pigmentation compared to the typical Cytisus albus, giving it a more subdued appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as heaths and coastal areas."
