    "intro": "Cirsium asperum, commonly known as hispid prickly lettuce, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, spiny leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer. Cirsium asperum is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
