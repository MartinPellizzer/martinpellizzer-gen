    "intro": "Cicuta tenuifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved water hemlock, is a highly toxic member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in wet or marshy areas and is native to parts of North America. Due to its potent toxicity, it is considered a dangerous weed and requires caution during identification and handling."
