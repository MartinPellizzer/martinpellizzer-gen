    "intro": "Cotyledon nodulosa, commonly known as the wrinkled cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant, star-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow during the growing season. Its compact growth habit makes it well-suited for rock gardens or container planting. Cotyledon nodulosa is relatively easy to care for, requiring well-draining soil and minimal water."
