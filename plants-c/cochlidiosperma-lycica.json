    "intro": "Cochlidiosperma lycica, commonly known as the Lycian fig, is a species of flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Moraceae and is characterized by its robust, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig-like fruits. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The Lycian fig is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically for its fruit and medicinal properties."
