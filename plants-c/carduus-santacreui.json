    "intro": "Carduus santacreui, commonly known as the Santacreu thistle, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features a robust, spiny stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, often branching near the base. The plant produces large, purple or pinkish composite flower heads, which are surrounded by stiff, bract-like leaves. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture and prominent lobes. The Santacreu thistle is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open fields and along roadsides."
