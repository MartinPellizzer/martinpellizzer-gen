    "intro": "Chamaejasme lessertii, commonly known as the Sierra Madre dwarf sage, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, adding a subtle floral display to its habitat. It is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems. Its botanical characteristics reflect its evolutionary response to the extreme conditions of its native range."
