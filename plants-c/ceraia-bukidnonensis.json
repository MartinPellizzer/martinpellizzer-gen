    "intro": "Ceraia bukidnonensis, commonly known as the Mindanao orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in montane forests. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, a common trait among epiphytic orchids. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ceraia bukidnonensis is considered a vulnerable species."
