    "intro": "Colutea armata, commonly known as the Armenian clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caucasus region. It features bipinnate leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early spring. Its seeds are encased in a distinctive, spiny pod that splits open when mature. Colutea armata is often found in rocky or forested areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role."
