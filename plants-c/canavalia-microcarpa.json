    "intro": "Canavalia microcarpa, commonly known as the small-seeded cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and cylindrical, hairy pods that contain small, edible seeds. The plant grows as an annual herb, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. It thrives in warm climates and is adapted to poor soils, making it a hardy crop. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria."
