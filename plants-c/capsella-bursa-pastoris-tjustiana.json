It features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by distinctive heart-shaped seed pods. The plant has alternate, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it a common weed in many regions."
