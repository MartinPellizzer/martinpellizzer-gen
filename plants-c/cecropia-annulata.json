    "intro": "Cecropia annulata, commonly known as the ringed ceiba, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, buttressed roots and striking, tiered trunk that often appears segmented. The plant has palmate leaves with three to five lobes and produces small, greenish flowers that develop into woody fruits. Its seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit, contributing to its wide distribution. Cecropia annulata plays an important ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitats."
