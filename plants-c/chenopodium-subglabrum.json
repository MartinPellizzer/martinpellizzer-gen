    "intro": "Chenopodium subglabrum, commonly known as smooth goosefoot, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks. The plant has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually smooth and glabrous, giving it its common name. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits known as utricles. The plant is often considered a weed but has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential health benefits."
