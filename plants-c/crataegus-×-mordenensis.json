    "intro": "Crataegus \u00d7 mordenensis, commonly known as the Morden hawthorn, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Crataegus monogyna and Crataegus crus-galli. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters. The plant features thorny branches, elliptical leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of white or pinkish flowers in the spring. It produces small, red berries that are edible but often tart, and it is valued for its ornamental qualities and wildlife habitat. The Morden hawthorn is native to Europe and has been cultivated for its hardiness and adaptability to various soil types."
