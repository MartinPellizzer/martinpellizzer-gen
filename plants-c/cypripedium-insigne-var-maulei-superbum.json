    "intro": "Cypripedium insigne var. maulei-superbum, commonly known as the Maule-Superbum Lady's Slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically a deep pink or purple hue. The plant features a single, erect stem that bears a single flower, and its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
