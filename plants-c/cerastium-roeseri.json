    "intro": "Cerastium roeseri, commonly known as snow-in-summer, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features hairy, blue-green leaves and produces tiny, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Cerastium roeseri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, ground-covering mats."
