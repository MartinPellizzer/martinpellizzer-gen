    "intro": "Cibotium wendlandii, commonly known as the Wendland's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Dicksoniaceae and is closely related to other tree ferns such as Cyathea and Alsophila. Its fronds are typically a deep green, with a smooth, leathery texture, and it produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds. Cibotium wendlandii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil for optimal growth."
