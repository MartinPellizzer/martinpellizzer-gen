    "intro": "Campylotheca henryi, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to China. It belongs to the family Tiliaceae and is characterized by its alternate, simple, and ovate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its showy, yellowish-orange flowers and its ability to thrive in various soil conditions. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
