    "intro": "Castilleja lithospermoides var. major, commonly known as the greater lithosperm leafcup, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and is often found growing on rocky soils in arid environments. Its leaves are typically small and scale-like, and it has a weak root system that attaches to the roots of other plants. This species plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host for certain fungi and insects."
