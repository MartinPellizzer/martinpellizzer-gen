    "intro": "Capparis pumila var. arfeuilleana, commonly known as the dwarf caper, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features small, waxy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to withstand arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, greenish-yellow berries. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its hardy nature and attractive foliage. This variety is particularly valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and hot, dry climates."
