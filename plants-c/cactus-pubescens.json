    "intro": "Cactus pubescens, commonly known as the woolly cactus, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, spiny stems covered in dense, white, woolly hair. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its water-storing stems. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. The plant's structure and appearance make it well-suited for survival in desert climates."
