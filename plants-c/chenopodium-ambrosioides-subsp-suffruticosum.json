    "intro": "Chenopodium ambrosioides subsp. suffruticosum, commonly known as prickly goosefoot, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and alternate leaves that are typically oval or rhombic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are followed by three-angled, fleshy fruits. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its spiny structure, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
