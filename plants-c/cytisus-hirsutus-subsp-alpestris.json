    "intro": "Cytisus hirsutus subsp. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine broom, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are small, trifoliate, and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
