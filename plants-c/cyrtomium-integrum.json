    "intro": "Cyrtomium integrum, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compact, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to form dense mats, making it suitable for ground cover in shaded environments. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Cyrtomium integrum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
