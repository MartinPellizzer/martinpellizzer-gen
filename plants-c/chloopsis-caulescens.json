It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to poor soils and low water availability. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in xerophytic gardens."
