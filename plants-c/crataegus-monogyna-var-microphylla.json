    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in length, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits called haws in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
