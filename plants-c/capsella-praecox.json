    "intro": "Capsella praecox, commonly known as the early common knotgrass, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and has a sprawling growth habit. The plant features small, white flowers with four petals, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and slightly hairy. Capsella praecox produces small, round seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds. It is often considered a weed but has ecological value in supporting pollinators."
