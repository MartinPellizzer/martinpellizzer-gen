    "intro": "Cynanchum auyantepuiense, commonly known as the Angel's Trumpet of the Guyanas, is a climbing vine native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous to touch or ingest. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, while its stems are woody and covered in fine hairs. This species is often found in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal, though caution is necessary due to its toxic properties."
