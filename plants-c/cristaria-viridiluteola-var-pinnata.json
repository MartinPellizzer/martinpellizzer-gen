    "intro": "Cristaria viridiluteola var. pinnata, commonly known as the slender green nettle, is a variant of the green nettle species characterized by its finely divided, pinnate leaves. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which contribute to its distinctive texture and appearance. The flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in dense clusters, and the plant is known for its stinging hairs that can cause irritation upon contact. It plays a role in supporting local insect populations and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
