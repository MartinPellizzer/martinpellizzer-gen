    "intro": "Croton cerinodentatus, commonly known as the waxy-toothed croton, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves with waxy, toothed margins that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikes, followed by orange to red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some regions for its unique foliage."
