    "intro": "Carex pairae, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and stream banks. Carex pairae produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are wind-pollinated, and it plays an important role in wetland ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat diversity."
