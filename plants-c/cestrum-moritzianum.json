    "intro": "Cestrum moritzianum, commonly known as the Moritz's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and aromatic foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are usually white or pale purple, which bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fragrance. Cestrum moritzianum is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential medicinal properties."
