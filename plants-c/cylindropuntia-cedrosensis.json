    "intro": "Cylindropuntia cedrosensis, commonly known as Cedros Island cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southern California Channel Islands. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in clusters of small, spine-tipped pads. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fruiting structures that disperse its seeds. It thrives in coastal scrub and sandy soils, adapting well to the arid and coastal climate of its native habitat. This species is notable for its resilience and is often found in rocky or disturbed areas."
