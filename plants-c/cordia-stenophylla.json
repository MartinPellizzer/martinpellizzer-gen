    "intro": "Cordia stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cordia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces showy, yellowish or reddish flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry to moist forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, Cordia stenophylla is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
