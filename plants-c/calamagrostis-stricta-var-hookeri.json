    "intro": "Calamagrostis stricta var. hookeri, commonly known as Hooker's tufted reed, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often silver-tomentose beneath. The plant produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and rocky slopes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
