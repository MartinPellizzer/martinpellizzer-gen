    "intro": "Cryptomeria japonica var. lobbii, commonly known as the Japanese cedar variety lobbii, is a rare and ornamental conifer native to southern Japan. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dense, dark green foliage that turns a striking coppery hue in the fall. The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, adding visual interest in the winter months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for garden landscapes. Due to its limited natural range and unique appearance, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in horticultural settings."
