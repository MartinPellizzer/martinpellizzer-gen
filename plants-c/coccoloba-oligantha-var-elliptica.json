It is a small, deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and the Gulf Coast. The plant is characterized by its clusters of small, bright red berries that appear in the fall, which are a key feature for identification. Its leaves are elliptical in shape, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
