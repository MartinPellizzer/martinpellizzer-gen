    "intro": "Chrysactinia, commonly known as the golden groundsel, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to North America and are characterized by their bright yellow flowers and hairy, often glandular leaves. They typically grow in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky areas. Chrysactinia species are herbaceous perennials with a compact growth habit. The flowers are arranged in composite heads, with both ray and disk flowers, contributing to their ornamental value."
