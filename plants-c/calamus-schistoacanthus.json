    "intro": "Calamus schistoacanthus, commonly known as the stone thorn reed, is a member of the Arecaceae family, native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of many palms. Its rhizomes are fibrous and have been historically used in traditional medicine. Calamus schistoacanthus thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical forests."
