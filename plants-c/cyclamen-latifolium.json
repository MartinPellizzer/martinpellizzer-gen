    "intro": "Cyclamen latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf cyclamen, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and the Caucasus. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in late autumn to early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers well-drained, humus-rich soil. Cyclamen latifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
