It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly found in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often dark green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are usually reddish or brownish in color. McClurg's sedge is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
