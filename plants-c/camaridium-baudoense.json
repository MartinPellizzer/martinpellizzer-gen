It belongs to the family Camaridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in moist, shaded areas of cloud forests. Its leaves are usually narrow and elongated, with a soft, velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
