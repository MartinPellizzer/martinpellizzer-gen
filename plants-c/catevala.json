    "intro": "Catevala, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often green or yellow in color. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Catevala is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies."
