    "intro": "Cerinthodes stylosum, commonly known as the slender-stemmed cerinthodes, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
