    "intro": "Cereus colosseus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and is capable of growing up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night and emit a strong fragrance. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Cereus colosseus is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
