    "intro": "Castilleja pilosa var. longispica, commonly known as the long-spined stickseed, is a flowering plant in the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its small, tubular flowers are usually pink to red in color and bloom in late spring to early summer. The variety longispica is distinguished by its longer, more rigid bracts compared to other varieties of Castilleja pilosa."
