    "intro": "Cynorkis dens-serpens, commonly known as the dense-serpentine orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a raceme, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
