    "intro": "Cassupa laevis var. chocoensis, commonly known as the Chocoan Cassupa, is a rare plant species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Colombia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an interesting subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
