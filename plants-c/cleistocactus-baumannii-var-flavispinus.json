    "intro": "Cleistocactus baumannii var. flavispinus, commonly known as the golden spined cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in dense, golden-yellow spines. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers during the warmer months, which are typically hidden within the stems, a trait known as cleistogamy. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and cactus collections."
