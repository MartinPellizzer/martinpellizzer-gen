    "intro": "Cryptocoryne sarawacensis, commonly known as the Sarawak cryptocoryne, is a species of aquatic plant native to the freshwater ecosystems of Borneo. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and compact growth habit, making it a popular choice for planted aquariums. The plant typically grows in slow-moving or still waters, often in shaded environments with soft, nutrient-rich substrates. Its leaves are elongated and sword-shaped, with a smooth texture and a slight waxy coating. Cryptocoryne sarawacensis is valued for its aesthetic appeal and ease of care, though it can be sensitive to water parameter fluctuations."
