    "intro": "Cheilanthes trichophylla, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori located on the underside of the fronds. This resilient fern is often found in crevices and on cliff faces, showcasing its ability to colonize harsh, nutrient-poor habitats."
