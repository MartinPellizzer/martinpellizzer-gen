    "intro": "Coleataenia rigidula subsp. condensa, commonly known as the rigid marsh thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often near water bodies such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant is characterized by its upright, sparsely hairy stems and basal rosettes of gray-green, lance-shaped leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a single, tall, yellowish-green flower head surrounded by several layers of bracts. The species is notable for its ecological importance in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland biodiversity."
