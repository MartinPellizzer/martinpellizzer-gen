    "intro": "Campanula samothracica subsp. samothracica, commonly known as the Samothrace bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Greek island of Samothraki. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, calcareous soils and is adapted to the harsh coastal and mountainous environments of its habitat. Its leaves are lanceolate and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
