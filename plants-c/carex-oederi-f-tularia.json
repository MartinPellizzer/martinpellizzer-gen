    "intro": "Carex oederi f. tularia, commonly known as the Tularia sedge, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers. The plant thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. The Tularia sedge is valued for its ecological role in supporting wetland biodiversity and its aesthetic appeal in water garden settings."
