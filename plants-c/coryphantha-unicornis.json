    "intro": "Coryphantha unicornis, commonly known as the unicorn cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a single, spiny stem that often appears to be a single \"horn,\" giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It has a shallow root system and is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Coryphantha unicornis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
