    "intro": "Cyperus petersianus, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often forming dense clumps near water bodies. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, three-ranked flowers, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Cyperus petersianus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
