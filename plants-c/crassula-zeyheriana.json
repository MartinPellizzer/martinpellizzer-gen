    "intro": "Crassula zeyheriana, commonly known as the Zeyher's crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is often grown as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance. Crassula zeyheriana prefers well-draining soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
