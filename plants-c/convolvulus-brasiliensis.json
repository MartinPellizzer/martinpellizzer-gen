    "intro": "Convolvulus brasiliensis, commonly known as Brazilian morning glory, is a climbing vine native to South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant produces small, round berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
