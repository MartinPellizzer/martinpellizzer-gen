    "intro": "Crataegus \u00d7 dispessa, commonly known as the hybrid hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Crataegus monogyna (common hawthorn) and Crataegus laevigata (smooth hawthorn), resulting in a plant with variable morphology. The leaves are typically oval to elliptical, with serrated edges, and the flowers are white or pink, appearing in clusters. The fruit is a red or orange berry that matures in the fall, providing food for various wildlife species. This plant is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia."
