    "intro": "Canna expansa-rubra, commonly known as the red flame cannas, is a striking ornamental plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, vibrant red and orange bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant produces showy, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by colorful, petal-like structures. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Canna expansa-rubra is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes due to its bold, tropical appearance."
