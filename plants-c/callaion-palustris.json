    "intro": "Callaion palustris, commonly known as the marsh bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, with a prominent, showy spathe. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers inside the spathe. Callaion palustris plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and wildlife."
