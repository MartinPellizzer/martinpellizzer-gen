    "intro": "Carludovica rheithrophila, commonly known as the Mexican nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. It is a shrub-like plant native to Mexico, characterized by its hairy stems and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by berries that change from green to red as they mature. Carludovica rheithrophila is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance. However, like many members of its family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
