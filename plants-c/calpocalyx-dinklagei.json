    "intro": "Calpocalyx dinklagei, commonly known as the Dinklage's calpocalyx, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its unique floral structure. The plant typically features showy, five-petaled flowers that are often brightly colored, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually palmately lobed, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments within its limited habitat. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, Calpocalyx dinklagei is considered a species of conservation concern."
