    "intro": "Cardamine plumieri proles hederacea, commonly known as the creeping water shield, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating on water surfaces. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are typically covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
