    "intro": "Cyperus oblongus subsp. flavus, commonly known as the yellow flatsedge, is a member of the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its grass-like appearance and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of yellowish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetland environments, including marshes and swampy areas, and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems."
