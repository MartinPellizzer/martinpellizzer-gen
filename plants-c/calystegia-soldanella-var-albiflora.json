    "intro": "Calystegia soldanella var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered field bindweed, is a variant of the field bindweed species native to Europe. It is a herbaceous perennial vine characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in late summer. Its hairy stems and fibrous roots allow it to thrive in disturbed soils and sunny environments. However, due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
