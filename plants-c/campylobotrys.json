    "intro": "Campylobotrys, commonly known as the water hyacinth, is a free-floating aquatic plant native to South America. It has bright green, arrowhead-shaped leaves and produces showy purple flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its rapid growth rate can lead to ecological imbalances by blocking sunlight and reducing oxygen levels in water. Campylobotrys is also known for its ability to absorb heavy metals from the water, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts."
