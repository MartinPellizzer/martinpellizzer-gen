    "intro": "Cotyledon ventricosa, commonly known as the \"fat cotyledon,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces vibrant, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red during the summer months. Its leaves are capable of storing water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
