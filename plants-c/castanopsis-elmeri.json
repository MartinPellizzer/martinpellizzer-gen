    "intro": "Castanopsis elmeri, commonly known as the Elmer's tanoak, is a species of evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of California and southern Oregon. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts, and is characterized by its hard, durable wood. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature typical of the genus Castanopsis. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed evergreen forests. Due to its ecological importance and unique morphology, Castanopsis elmeri plays a significant role in the biodiversity of its native habitat."
