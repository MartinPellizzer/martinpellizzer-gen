    "intro": "Ctenopteris militaris, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It features fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, sword-like shape. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are covered in small, scale-like structures that help reduce water loss. Ctenopteris militaris is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
