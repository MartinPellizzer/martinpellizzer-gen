    "intro": "Cuphea melampyrifolia, commonly known as the flame flower, is a tropical shrub native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red flowers that resemble flames, which are highly attractive to hummingbirds. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a textured appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Cuphea melampyrifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a pollinator-friendly plant."
