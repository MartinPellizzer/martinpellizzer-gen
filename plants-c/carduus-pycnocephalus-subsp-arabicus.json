    "intro": "Carduus pycnocephalus subsp. arabicus, commonly known as the Arabian thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and a dense, spherical cluster of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Its robust structure and hardy nature make it a common weed in disturbed areas. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for insects and serving as a pioneer species in degraded habitats."
