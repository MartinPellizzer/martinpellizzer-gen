    "intro": "Campanula phyteumoides, commonly known as the meadow bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. This plant prefers well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, often found in meadows and woodland edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive flowers and easy care requirements."
