    "intro": "Chamaesyce wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It has a sprawling habit with numerous stolons that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The leaves are typically fleshy, hairy, and succulent, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are often hidden beneath the foliage. This plant is well-suited to rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities."
