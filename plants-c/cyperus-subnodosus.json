    "intro": "Cyperus subnodosus, commonly known as the zigzag sedge, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, three-lobed flowers, which are usually pale green to brown in color. Cyperus subnodosus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
