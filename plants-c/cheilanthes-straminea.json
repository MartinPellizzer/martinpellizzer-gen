    "intro": "Cheilanthes straminea, commonly known as the golden maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white or yellowish hair, giving it its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of rocks or trees without being parasitic. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in crevices or on cliff faces. Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is a popular ornamental plant in dry gardens."
