    "intro": "Carex congolensis, commonly known as the Congo sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex congolensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
