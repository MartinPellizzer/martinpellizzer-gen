    "intro": "Crotalaria lotoides, commonly known as the small lotus bean or yellow crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its seeds are enclosed in pods, and the plant is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment. However, some species within the genus Crotalaria can produce toxic alkaloids, requiring caution in handling or consumption."
