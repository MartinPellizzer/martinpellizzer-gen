    "intro": "Cyclogramma flexilis, commonly known as the flexible legume, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with slender stems that twine around supports. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small leaflets, and it produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple. Cyclogramma flexilis is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often forming dense thickets that provide habitat for various desert organisms."
