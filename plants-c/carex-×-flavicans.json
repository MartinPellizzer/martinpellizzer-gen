    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 flavicans, commonly known as the yellow sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. Native to North America, this plant thrives in wetland environments such as marshes and pond edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. The plant's ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
