    "intro": "Corymbia blakei subsp. rasilis, commonly known as the Blake's bloodwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that often appears flaky or scaly, and its lance-shaped leaves that are usually grey-green in color. The tree produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. This subspecies is adapted to dry, seasonally wet environments and is often found in woodland and open forest habitats."
