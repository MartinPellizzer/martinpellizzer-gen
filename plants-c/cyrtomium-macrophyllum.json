    "intro": "Cyrtomium macrophyllum, commonly known as the giant holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that can grow up to 2 feet in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense mats. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Cyrtomium macrophyllum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
