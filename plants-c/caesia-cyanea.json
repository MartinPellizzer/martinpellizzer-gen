    "intro": "Caesia cyanea, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, though it is often mistaken for a type of sedge. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in wet or moist environments such as swamps and marshes. Caesia cyanea plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing wetland soils."
