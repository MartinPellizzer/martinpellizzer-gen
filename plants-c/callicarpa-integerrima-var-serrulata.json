    "intro": "Callicarpa integerrima var. serrulata, commonly known as the Chinese beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, vibrant purple berries that appear in late summer. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges, which give it its varietal name. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The berries are edible for humans and birds but are typically not consumed by humans due to their tart flavor."
