    "intro": "Cypripedium peteri, commonly known as the Yunnan lily, is a rare and endangered orchid native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It is characterized by its large, showy, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive, hooded lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats, often in forest understories. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened in the wild."
