It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in rainforests or along riverbanks. Its rhizome system supports the growth of the trunk, while its fronds play a crucial role in photosynthesis. Cyathea kemberangana is valued not only for its ornamental appearance but also for its ecological significance in maintaining forest biodiversity."
