    "intro": "Caralluma huillensis, commonly known as the Huill\u00e9n candelabra, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the family Nyctaginaceae and is characterized by its branching, succulent stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, colorful flowers, typically in shades of red, yellow, or orange, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are usually reduced to small spines, a feature that helps minimize water loss. Caralluma huillensis is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to high levels of sunlight and extreme temperature fluctuations."
