    "intro": "Cyperus corymbosus var. brevispiculosus, commonly known as the narrow-bracted flatsedge, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, poorly drained soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can dominate aquatic habitats. Due to its adaptability, it is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich wetlands."
