    "intro": "Cousinia pseudaffinis var. bucharica, commonly known as the Bukhara cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Central Asia. It forms dense, mat-like growths with tightly packed, silver-gray foliage that helps it survive in arid and high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, including strong winds and limited water availability. Its unique morphology and ecological resilience make it a valuable species for alpine and steppe ecosystems."
