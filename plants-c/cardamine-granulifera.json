    "intro": "Cardamine granulifera, commonly known as the granulate watercress, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a slightly hairy surface and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
