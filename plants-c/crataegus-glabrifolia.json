    "intro": "Crataegus glabrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-fruited hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and small white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red to orange berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Crataegus glabrifolia is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks, thriving in well-drained soils. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in native plant gardens."
