    "intro": "Carex aestivalis, commonly known as the summer sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces spikelets that bear small, three-lobed flowers. Native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and marshy areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a valuable plant for erosion control and wetland restoration."
