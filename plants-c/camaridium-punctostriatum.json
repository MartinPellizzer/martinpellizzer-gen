    "intro": "Camaridium punctostriatum, commonly known as the spotted-striated orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant's leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its humid environment. It thrives in shaded, moist conditions and is often found growing epiphytically on trees or in rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
