    "intro": "Caucanthus chiovendae, commonly known as the Chiovenda's caucanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in areas with high altitudes and cool climates. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Caucanthus chiovendae is considered a vulnerable species."
