    "intro": "Callitropsis benthamii, commonly known as the Benthams' tamarack, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub with needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern."
