    "intro": "Cissus sulcicaulis, commonly known as the zigzag vine, is a climbing plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, wavy, and often zigzagging stems that help it grip surfaces as it climbs. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough, textured surface. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, tart fruits. This plant is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appearance in gardens."
