    "intro": "Campanula pusilla var. delpontei, commonly known as the dwarf bellflower, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its compact form. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant."
