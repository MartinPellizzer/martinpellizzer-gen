    "intro": "Chylismia brevipes subsp. brevipes, commonly known as the narrowleaf chylismia, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
