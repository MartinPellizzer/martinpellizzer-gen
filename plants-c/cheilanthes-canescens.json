    "intro": "Cheilanthes canescens, commonly known as the rusty cliffbrake, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its wiry, grayish-green fronds that are often covered in a fine, rusty-colored pubescence. This plant is typically found growing on rocky outcrops and in dry, sunny habitats across the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in crevices and absorb moisture from the air. The fronds are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often curled at the tips."
