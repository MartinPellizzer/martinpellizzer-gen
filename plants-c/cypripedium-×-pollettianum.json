    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 pollettianum, commonly known as the Pollett's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its large, showy, slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a single, erect stem that bears a single flower, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
