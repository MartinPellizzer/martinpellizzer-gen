    "intro": "Cerastium glomeratum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a mat-forming growth habit, often carpeting rocky or disturbed soils. It is adapted to thrive in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Cerastium glomeratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in gardens for its delicate appearance."
