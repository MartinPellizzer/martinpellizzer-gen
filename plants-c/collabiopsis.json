It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plants typically grow in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Collabiopsis species are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Their growth habit and morphological features make them distinct within the Malvaceae family."
