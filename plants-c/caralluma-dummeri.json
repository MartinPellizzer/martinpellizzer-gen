    "intro": "Caralluma dummeri, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of India and Pakistan. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes and potatoes, and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and small, star-shaped leaves. The plant produces violet or purple flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its ability to store water in its stems makes it highly adapted to survive in dry environments. Caralluma dummeri is also known for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its efficacy."
