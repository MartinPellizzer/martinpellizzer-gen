    "intro": "Cerastium decalvans f. serbicum, commonly known as the Serbicum mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to thrive in temperate climates."
