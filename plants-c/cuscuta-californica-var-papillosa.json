    "intro": "Cuscuta californica var. papillosa, commonly known as the California dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to California and thrives in dry, disturbed habitats such as fields and along roadsides. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant can become invasive in certain areas. Botanically, it is characterized by its reduced leaves and specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host plant's tissues."
