    "intro": "Caltha vulgaris, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of heart-shaped, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has smooth, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread easily and form dense colonies."
