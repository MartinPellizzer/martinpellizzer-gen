    "intro": "Cyathea obnoxia, commonly known as the obnoxious tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant can grow up to 10 meters in height, with a trunk that is often covered in a thick layer of old fronds. Its rhizome is fibrous and serves as a storage organ, while the fronds are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. Cyathea obnoxia plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various organisms."
