It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting flowers, which remain intact even when dried."
