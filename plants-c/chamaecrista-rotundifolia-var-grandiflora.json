    "intro": "Chamaecrista rotundifolia var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered burr legume, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its round, palmate leaves and showy, yellow-orange pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, spiny pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open woods. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
