    "intro": "Cytisus kovacevii, commonly known as the Kova\u010devi\u0107's broom, is a shrub native to the Balkans, particularly in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers clustered in racemes, typical of the Genista and Cytisus genera. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being oval and hairy, and it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Cytisus kovacevii is often found in open woodlands and scrublands, adapting well to sunny and dry conditions."
