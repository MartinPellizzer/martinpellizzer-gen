    "intro": "Chrysopsis graminifolia var. microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf blueweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid and semi-arid environments. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it a suitable plant for xeriscaping and erosion control in dry landscapes."
