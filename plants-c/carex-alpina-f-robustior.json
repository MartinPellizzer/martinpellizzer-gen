    "intro": "Carex alpina f. robustior, commonly known as the robust alpine sedge, is a variant of the alpine sedge native to mountainous regions. It is a perennial grass-like plant characterized by its dense, grassy foliage and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. It produces small, clustered spikes of flowers that are wind-pollinated, typical of many sedges."
