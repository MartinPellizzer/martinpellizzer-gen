    "intro": "Ceratopetalorchis laurentii, commonly known as the Laurentian orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the temperate regions of North America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces a single, erect spike bearing several flowers, which are often fragrant. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
