    "intro": "Centaurea monticola subsp. citricolor, commonly known as the citricolor star-thistle, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in dense, spherical heads. The plant has spiny, bristly leaves and stems, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. Due to its invasive tendencies in some areas, it can pose a challenge to native plant communities."
