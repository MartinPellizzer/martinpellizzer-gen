    "intro": "Cuscuta tasmanica, commonly known as the Tasmanian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to Australia. It lacks true leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host for nutrients and water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found growing on the stems of other plants such as grasses and shrubs. Its life cycle involves germinating on host tissue and forming specialized structures called haustoria to extract resources. Cuscuta tasmanica plays a role in local ecosystems by influencing the growth and distribution of its host plants."
