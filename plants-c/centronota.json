    "intro": "Centronota, commonly known as the false hawthorn, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. The plants are shrubs or small trees, characterized by their opposite, simple leaves and showy, clustered flowers. Centronota species produce small, fleshy fruits that are often covered in a waxy coating. These botanical features make them distinctive members of the Euphorbiaceae family, with adaptations suited to their diverse habitats."
