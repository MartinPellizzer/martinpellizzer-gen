    "intro": "Caragana soongorica, commonly known as the Soongorica shrub, is a deciduous shrub native to Central Asia, particularly found in the arid regions of Kazakhstan and China. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, compound leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by legume pods containing several seeds. It is well adapted to sandy and saline soils, making it a hardy species in semi-arid climates. Caragana soongorica plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitats."
