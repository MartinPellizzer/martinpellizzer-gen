    "intro": "Creochiton turbinatus, commonly known as the turbinated limpet, is a species of sea snail belonging to the family Lepetodrilidae. It is characterized by its small, conical shell that is often adorned with a spiral pattern. This marine gastropod is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches itself to rocky substrates. The shell provides protection against predators and environmental stressors. Its diet primarily consists of algae and other organic matter found in its habitat."
