    "intro": "Callixene polyphylla, commonly known as the broadleaf dandelion, is a herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and a distinctive yellow-orange flower head that develops into a fluffy seed dispersal mechanism. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Callixene polyphylla is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
