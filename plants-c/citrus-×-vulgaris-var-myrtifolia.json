    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 vulgaris var. myrtifolia, commonly known as the myrtle-leaved lemon, is a hybrid citrus plant characterized by its fragrant, narrow leaves that resemble those of myrtle. It produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are typically smaller than standard lemons but have a similar tart flavor. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as for its edible fruit. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This variety is also valued for its aromatic properties and is used in both culinary and traditional medicine applications."
