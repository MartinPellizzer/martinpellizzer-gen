    "intro": "Ctenitis santae-clarae, commonly known as the Santa Clara fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Ctenitis santae-clarae plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
