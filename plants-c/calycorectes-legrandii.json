It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its striking yellow and green floral structure. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are often surrounded by a distinctive, cup-like calyx. Calycorectes legrandii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species in its native range."
