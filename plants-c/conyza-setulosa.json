    "intro": "Conyza setulosa, commonly known as the hairy weed or goatweed, is an annual flowering plant native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and wind-dispersed seeds. The plant has slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture, and it often grows in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. Conyza setulosa is considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new habitats."
