    "intro": "Canthium glaucum var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy canthium, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature, contributing to its dispersal in natural habitats. The species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
