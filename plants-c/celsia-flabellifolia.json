It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that resemble a fan, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
