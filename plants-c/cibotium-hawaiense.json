    "intro": "Cibotium hawaiense, commonly known as the Hawaiian tree fern, is a distinctive member of the Dicksoniaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. Native to the Hawaiian Islands, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. Its rhizome is thick and woody, supporting the plant's growth and helping it anchor in rocky or clay soils. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various native species."
