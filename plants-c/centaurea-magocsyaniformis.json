It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of individual flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive bladdery appearance due to the inflated calyces. It is a perennial species that produces small, bristly seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
