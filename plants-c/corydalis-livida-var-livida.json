    "intro": "Corydalis livida var. livida, commonly known as the Alpine Corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Fumariaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across rocky and alpine habitats. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in meadows and forested areas at high elevations. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
