    "intro": "Camara vulgaris, commonly known as the common nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate or elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into berries, which are typically purple or black when mature. These berries contain toxic compounds, making the plant potentially harmful to humans and animals. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and often grows in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
