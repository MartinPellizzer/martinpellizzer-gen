    "intro": "Callitriche hermaphroditica subsp. exalata, commonly known as the broadleaf water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, such as ponds, ditches, and the margins of lakes. The plant features slender, branching stems with small, opposite, ovate leaves that are often coated in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which are typically submerged or just at the water's surface. It is a dioecious species, meaning that male and female flowers are found on separate plants, though some populations may show hermaphroditism."
