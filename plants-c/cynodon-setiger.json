    "intro": "Cynodon setiger, commonly known as the hairy grass or African dogstail, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, slightly hairy leaves that are often rolled when dry. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. Cynodon setiger is often used in erosion control and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and rapid growth."
