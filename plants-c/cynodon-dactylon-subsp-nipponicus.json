It is characterized by its fine, dense foliage and creeping growth habit, forming a dense turf. The plant has narrow, blade-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the summer. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for lawns and erosion control. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth allows it to spread rapidly and establish quickly in various soil types."
