    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 schatzii, commonly known as the Schatz's sedge, is a hybrid plant in the Carex genus, belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, strap-shaped leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and riparian zones, and prefers partial to full shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands. Carex \u00d7 schatzii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
