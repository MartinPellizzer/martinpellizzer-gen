    "intro": "Convolvulus ternifolius, commonly known as the three-leaved morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in threes. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and bloom in the early morning. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its rapid growth and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a garden plant."
