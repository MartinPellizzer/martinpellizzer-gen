    "intro": "Corydalis iraschkeviczii, commonly known as the Iraschkevicz's larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically range in color from pale pink to deep purple. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
