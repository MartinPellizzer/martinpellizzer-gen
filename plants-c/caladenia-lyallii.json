    "intro": "Caladenia lyallii, commonly known as the Lyall's spider orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and its distinctive, spider-like flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or heathlands. It produces a single or occasionally two flowers per stem, with narrow, pointed petals and a prominent, hooded labellum. Caladenia lyallii is a protected species due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to habitat disturbance."
