    "intro": "Cardamine cordifolia var. lyallii, commonly known as Lyall's heartleaf watercress, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its heart-shaped leaves are usually covered in a fine layer of hairs, and it produces small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators. This variety is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and ecological niche within its native habitat."
