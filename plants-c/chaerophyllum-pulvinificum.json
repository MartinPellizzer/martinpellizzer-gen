    "intro": "Chaerophyllum pulvinificum, commonly known as the European hogweed, is a flowering plant in the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in an umbel, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its toxic sap, it can be harmful to both humans and animals if handled improperly."
