    "intro": "Cyperus conglomeratus var. socotranus, commonly known as Socotra's sedge, is a flowering plant native to the Arabian Peninsula and the island of Socotra. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in coastal dunes or rocky soils. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain single seeds. This species is notable for its adaptation to harsh, saline conditions and is considered a relict species with a unique ecological role in its native habitat."
