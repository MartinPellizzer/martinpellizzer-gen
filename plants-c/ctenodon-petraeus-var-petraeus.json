    "intro": "Ctenodon petraeus var. petraeus, commonly known as the rock ctenodon, is a rare and specialized plant species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
