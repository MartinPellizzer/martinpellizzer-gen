    "intro": "Coelodiscus montanus, commonly known as the mountain corydalis, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae, which includes poppies and other flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant features delicate, nodding flowers that are typically pink or purple, with petals that resemble those of the genus Corydalis. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, adapting to the cool, moist conditions of its mountainous habitat. Coelodiscus montanus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment."
