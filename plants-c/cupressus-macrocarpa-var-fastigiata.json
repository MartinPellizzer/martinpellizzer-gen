    "intro": "Cupressus macrocarpa var. fastigiata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lacebark, is a compact, columnar evergreen conifer native to New Zealand. It features scale-like leaves that are tightly packed, giving it a dense, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, spherical cones that are typically reddish-brown in color. It is well-suited for small gardens or as a specimen plant due to its upright growth habit. This variety is also valued for its ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions and its year-round visual interest."
