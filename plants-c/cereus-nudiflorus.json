    "intro": "Cereus nudiflorus, commonly known as the naked-flower cactus, is a species native to southern Africa. It is a tall, spiny cactus that can grow up to 6 meters in height, with cylindrical stems covered in sharp, white spines. The plant produces large, white, night-blooming flowers that are typically 15-20 centimeters in diameter. These flowers open only at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
