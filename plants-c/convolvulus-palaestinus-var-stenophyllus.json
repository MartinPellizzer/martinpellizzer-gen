    "intro": "Convolvulus palaestinus var. stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bindweed, is a flowering plant native to the Middle East and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, pale purple to white flowers that bloom in the summer. The leaves are typically narrow and alternate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This species is often found growing in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. It is a perennial plant that spreads through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a resilient and adaptable species in its native habitat."
