    "intro": "Cremnophila linguifolia, commonly known as the crested lark's tongue, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbels, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
