    "intro": "Castilleja excelsa, commonly known as the tall paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It thrives in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often growing in association with grasses and forbs. Castilleja excelsa plays an important role in pollinator ecosystems due to its nectar-rich flowers."
