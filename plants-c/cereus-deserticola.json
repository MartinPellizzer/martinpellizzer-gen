    "intro": "Cereus deserticola, commonly known as the desert night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, night-blooming flowers that are highly fragrant and attract nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. The plant has a slow growth rate and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
