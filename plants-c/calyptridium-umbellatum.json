    "intro": "Calyptridium umbellatum, commonly known as the mountain everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Australia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation across rocky and arid environments. Its foliage is typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Calyptridium umbellatum is often found in open habitats such as heathlands and woodland edges, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
