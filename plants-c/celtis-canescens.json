    "intro": "Celtis canescens, commonly known as the gray hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Elaeocarpaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and small, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, dark blue berries that are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Celtis canescens is typically found in moist bottomlands and along streams, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its adaptability makes it a common sight in both natural and urban landscapes."
