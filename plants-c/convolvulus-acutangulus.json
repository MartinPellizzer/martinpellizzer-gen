    "intro": "Convolvulus acutangulus, commonly known as the sharp-leaved morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
