    "intro": "Cactus phymatothele, commonly known as the desert spine cactus, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that are adapted to store water and withstand extreme arid conditions. The plant features a compact growth form with a short, thick trunk and a crown of leaves that are modified into spines. Its flowers are typically small and yellow or green, appearing in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
