    "intro": "Castilleja subinclusa var. franciscana, commonly known as the Franciscan paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, red-orange inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are often reduced or scale-like. It typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as meadows and grasslands, and it relies on other plants for some of its nutrients. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
