    "intro": "Crucianella imbricata, commonly known as the coastal sandwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and along the edges of salt marshes. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers. It is adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Crucianella imbricata plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
