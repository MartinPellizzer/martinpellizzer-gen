    "intro": "Caenopteris disticha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Caenopteris disticha is notable for its simple, non-branching rhizome and its ability to reproduce through spores rather than seeds."
