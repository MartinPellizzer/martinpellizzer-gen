It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. This plant is typically found in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Cyperus dilatatus is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in waterlogged soils. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
