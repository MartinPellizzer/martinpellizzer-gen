    "intro": "Capsella ruderalis, commonly known as the common mouse-ear or field mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often considered a weed. It has small, pale yellow flowers and produces numerous small, round seeds. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it a resilient species."
