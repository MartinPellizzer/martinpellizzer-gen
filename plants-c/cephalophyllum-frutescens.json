    "intro": "Cephalophyllum frutescens, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a striking member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico. It is a low-growing, succulent plant characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant's unique appearance, with its pale, almost translucent petals, gives it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
