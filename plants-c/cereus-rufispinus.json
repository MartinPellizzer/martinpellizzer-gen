    "intro": "Cereus rufispinus, commonly known as the red-spined cactus, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, a feature common among many cacti. Its stems are covered in sharp, red-tipped spines, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
