    "intro": "Croton denticulatus, commonly known as the toothed croton, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Croton denticulatus is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant foliage. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
