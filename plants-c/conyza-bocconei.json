    "intro": "Conyza bocconei, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is an annual herb that grows up to 1.5 meters tall, characterized by its erect stem and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by the wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in open fields."
