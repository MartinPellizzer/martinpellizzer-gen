    "intro": "Caragana turfanensis, commonly known as the Turfan shrub or Turfan caragana, is a deciduous shrub native to Central Asia, particularly found in the Xinjiang region of China. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, compound leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees. Its hardy nature allows it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well-suited for reclamation of degraded soils. The seeds of Caragana turfanensis are encased in a tough, leathery pod and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to spread in suitable habitats."
