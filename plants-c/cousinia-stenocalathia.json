    "intro": "Cousinia stenocalathia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved globemallow, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf structures and often edible seeds. The plant features rosettes of narrow, fleshy leaves and produces showy, yellow or orange flowers in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. Cousinia stenocalathia is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
