    "intro": "Chrysanthemum gracile, commonly known as the slender chrysanthemum, is a herbaceous perennial native to East Asia. It features finely divided, feathery leaves that are often covered in a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, white, and pink, typically blooming in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for garden borders and containers. Due to its compact growth habit, it is also suitable for rock gardens and as a bedding plant."
