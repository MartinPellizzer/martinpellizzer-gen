    "intro": "Couratari oblongifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian rubber tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It is often found in moist, lowland forests and is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity. However, it is not typically cultivated for commercial purposes compared to other rubber-producing species."
