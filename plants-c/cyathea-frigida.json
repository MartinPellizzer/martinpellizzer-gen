    "intro": "Cyathea frigida, commonly known as the cold fern, is a species of tree fern native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a layer of persistent, fibrous roots. The plant produces large, compound fronds that are typically arching and can reach lengths of up to several meters. Cyathea frigida thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
