    "intro": "Coppensia majevskyae, commonly known as the Majevsky's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of New Guinea. It is characterized by its delicate, ghostly white flowers that bloom in late winter, adding a mysterious beauty to its habitat. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and debris for sustenance. Its small, fleshy roots help it absorb moisture from the humid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Coppensia majevskyae is considered a critically endangered species."
