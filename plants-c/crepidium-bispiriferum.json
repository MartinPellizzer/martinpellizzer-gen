    "intro": "Crepidium bispiriferum, commonly known as the spiral-leaf orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
