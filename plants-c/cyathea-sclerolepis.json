    "intro": "Cyathea sclerolepis, commonly known as the rigid-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive, smooth, grayish-brown trunk covered in a layer of old leaf bases. Its fronds are typically stiff and leathery, with a dark green color and a waxy texture. Cyathea sclerolepis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
