    "intro": "Campanula glomerata var. coriacea, commonly known as the rough bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It features upright, branched stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The leaves are typically rough to the touch, hence the species name *coriacea*, which means \"leathery\" in Latin. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
