    "intro": "Crocus veluchensis f. albus, commonly known as the white veluchensis crocus, is a rare and elegant variant of the veluchensis crocus. It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which contrast with the typical purple or pink hues of the species. This plant is native to specific regions in the Mediterranean, where it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. It typically blooms in early spring, adding a subtle yet striking touch to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and unique coloration, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
