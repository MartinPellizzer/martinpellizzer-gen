It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its habitat. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is distinguished by its bright yellow color, setting it apart from other varieties of Camissonia dentata."
