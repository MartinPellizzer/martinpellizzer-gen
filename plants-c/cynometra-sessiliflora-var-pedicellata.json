    "intro": "Cynometra sessiliflora var. pedicellata, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical tree native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and smooth, dark bark. The leaves are typically alternate, simple, and elliptical in shape. The fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds. This variant is distinguished by its pedicellate (stalked) flowers, which set it apart from the typical sessiliflora form."
