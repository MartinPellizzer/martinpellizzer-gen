    "intro": "Caladenia sanguinea, commonly known as the crimson spider-orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family native to Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and vibrant red flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. Its flowers are pollinated by thynnid wasps, which are attracted to the orchid's specialized structure and scent. Caladenia sanguinea is a perennial herb that produces a single, showy flower per stem, making it a notable species in Australian flora."
