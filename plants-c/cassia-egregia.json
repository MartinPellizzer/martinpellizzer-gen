    "intro": "Cassia egregia, commonly known as the golden flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow flowers that bloom in dense clusters, often resembling flames. The plant produces long, narrow pods that contain flat, winged seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments. Cassia egregia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
