    "intro": "Chrysanthemum perralderii, commonly known as the Alpine chrysanthemum, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and is often used in garden settings for its ornamental value. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and considered a species of conservation concern in some areas."
