    "intro": "Colocasia virosa, commonly known as the toxic arrowroot, is a tropical plant belonging to the Araceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 50 cm in diameter. The plant produces a spadix inflorescence surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in wet, shady environments. However, it is toxic due to the presence of calcium oxalate crystals, making it harmful if ingested."
