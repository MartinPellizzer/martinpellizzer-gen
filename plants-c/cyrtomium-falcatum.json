    "intro": "Cyrtomium falcatum, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are typically narrow and lance-shaped, giving it a distinctive, sword-like appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups known as sorus. Cyrtomium falcatum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in horticulture for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
