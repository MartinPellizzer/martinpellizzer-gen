    "intro": "Coelospermum, commonly known as the \"Mexican beauty\" or \"flower of the sun,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the Malvaceae family. It is native to Central and South America, with some species found in the Caribbean and parts of the southern United States. The plants typically have showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a distinctive yellow center. They are shrubs or small trees, characterized by their alternate leaves and fibrous roots. Coelospermum species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their vibrant blooms."
