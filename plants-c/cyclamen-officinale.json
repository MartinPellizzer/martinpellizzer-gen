    "intro": "Cyclamen officinale, commonly known as the Persian cyclamen, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its tuberous root system allows it to survive harsh conditions by entering a dormant state during dry periods. Cyclamen officinale is also valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
