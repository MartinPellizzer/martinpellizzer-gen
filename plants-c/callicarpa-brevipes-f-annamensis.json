    "intro": "Callicarpa brevipes f. annamensis, commonly known as the Annam wild beautyberry, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its clusters of small, bright purple berries that appear in late summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, white flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The berries are edible but have a slightly tart flavor, making them a subject of interest for both botanists and foragers."
