    "intro": "Colchicum pseudoparvulum, commonly known as the dwarf autumn crocus, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces striking violet-blue flowers in the autumn, typically from September to November. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a corm, and its flowers are borne on tall, slender stalks. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
