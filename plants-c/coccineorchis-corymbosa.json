    "intro": "Coccineorchis corymbosa, commonly known as the coral orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vivid coral-red flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in mountainous regions. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, while its leaves are broad and lance-shaped. The orchid's unique coloration and habitat preferences make it a notable species in botanical studies."
