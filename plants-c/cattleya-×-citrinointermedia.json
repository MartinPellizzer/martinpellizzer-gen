    "intro": "Cattleya \u00d7 citrinointermedia, commonly known as the Lemon Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid species renowned for its vibrant, lemon-yellow flowers. It originates from the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in warm, humid climates. This plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to survive periods of drought. The flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, often lasting several weeks, making it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
