    "intro": "Colutea karakoramensis, commonly known as the Karakoram bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and the Karakoram mountain ranges. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits that enclose the seeds. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it adapts to cold and arid conditions. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish-white flowers during the summer months. Colutea karakoramensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
