    "intro": "Crataegus \u00d7 curcina, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a hybrid shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds and some mammals but are generally considered toxic to humans. Its leaves are oval with serrated edges and turn vibrant shades of red or orange in the fall. Crataegus \u00d7 curcina is often used in hedgerows and gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
