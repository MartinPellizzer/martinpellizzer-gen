    "intro": "Cactus longisetus, commonly known as the long-spined cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, sharp spines that provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically followed by small, red fruits. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments with minimal rainfall. Cactus longisetus is often used in traditional medicine and is also popular as an ornamental plant in dry landscapes."
