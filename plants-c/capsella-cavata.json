    "intro": "Capsella cavata, commonly known as the common mouse-ear or mouse-ear cress, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of four-petaled white flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and gardens. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it has a short life cycle, completing its growth and reproduction within a single growing season. Capsella cavata is also known for its historical use in traditional medicine."
