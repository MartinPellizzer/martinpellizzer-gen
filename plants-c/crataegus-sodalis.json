    "intro": "Crataegus sodalis, commonly known as the sand cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open woodlands or along streambanks. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges, and it is often used in ecological restoration due to its hardiness. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
