    "intro": "Cyathea squamulata, commonly known as the silver tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are covered in a dense layer of pale, velvety scales, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Cyathea squamulata plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various forest organisms."
