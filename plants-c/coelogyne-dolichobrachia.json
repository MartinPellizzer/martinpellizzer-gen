It is characterized by its slender, pendant-like inflorescence that can extend up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with prominent, recurved petals and a distinctive, elongated lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Coelogyne dolichobrachia is prized in horticulture for its elegant appearance and unique floral structure."
