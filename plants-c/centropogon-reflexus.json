    "intro": "Centropogon reflexus, commonly known as the curlytail grass, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue or white flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly curled or reflexed appearance, giving it its common name. Centropogon reflexus is typically found in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and coastal areas."
