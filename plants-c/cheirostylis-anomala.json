    "intro": "Cheirostylis anomala, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cheirostylis anomala is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
