    "intro": "Catapodium aquaticum, commonly known as the water clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is characterized by its small, spore-producing structures called strobili. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks or in wetlands. The plant has a creeping rhizome with erect, linear leaves that are often clustered at the base. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a trait common among ancient plant groups. Due to its habitat preferences, it plays a role in stabilizing soil in aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems."
