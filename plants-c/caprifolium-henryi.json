    "intro": "Caprifolium henryi, commonly known as Henry's honeysuckle, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Caprifolium henryi is considered an endangered species."
