It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant has grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and arranged in a triangular cross-section, a characteristic feature of many sedges. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in a cylindrical inflorescence. Carex lacunarum prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks."
