It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. Its slender, triangular stems are often topped with clusters of small, pale brown flowers. Cyperus leonensis plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
