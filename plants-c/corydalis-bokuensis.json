    "intro": "Corydalis bokuensis, commonly known as the Boku mountain corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant produces small, oval-shaped capsules as its fruit, containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
