    "intro": "Crataegus perrara, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus perrara is often found in woodlands, hedgerows, and along stream banks. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
