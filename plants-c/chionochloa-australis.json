    "intro": "Chionochloa australis, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it thrive in high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to cold, windy conditions and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. Chionochloa australis plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
