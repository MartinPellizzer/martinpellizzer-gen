    "intro": "Cistus mollis, commonly known as the woolly rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy leaves and showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its aromatic foliage and ability to withstand drought conditions make it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Cistus mollis also plays a role in supporting local pollinators and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
