    "intro": "Caragana bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored shrub or yellow shrub, is a deciduous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and consist of 6 to 12 pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a legume that splits open to release small, rounded seeds. Caragana bicolor is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
