    "intro": "Cynodon dactylon var. biflorus, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in hot, dry climates. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. It is widely used for erosion control and as a lawn grass due to its drought tolerance and rapid growth. Its rhizomatous and stolonal growth system allows it to spread aggressively and form a dense sod."
