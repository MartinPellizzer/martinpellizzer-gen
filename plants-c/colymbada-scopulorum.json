    "intro": "Colymbada scopulorum, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in rocky and coastal environments. It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. This plant is typically found on bare rock surfaces, where it forms a crust-like growth. Its slow-growing nature makes it an indicator of environmental conditions. Due to its specialized habitat, it is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality and climate change impacts."
