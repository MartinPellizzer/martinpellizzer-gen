    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris viaria, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. The plant has alternate, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. The species is notable for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction."
