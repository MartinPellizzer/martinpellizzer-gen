    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis meihuashanensis, commonly known as Meihua Shan\u6906, is a rare and endemic species native to Taiwan. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, chestnuts, and beeches. The plant is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves and produces small, cup-shaped fruits that contain one or two seeds. It typically grows in montane forests at elevations above 1,500 meters, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
