    "intro": "Clavigera riddellii, commonly known as the Riddell's clubmoss, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a distinctive, branching stem structure typical of clubmosses. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and rocky outcrops. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, produce spores and are an important feature for its propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Clavigera riddellii is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
