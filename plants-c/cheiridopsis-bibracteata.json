It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to xeriscaping efforts."
