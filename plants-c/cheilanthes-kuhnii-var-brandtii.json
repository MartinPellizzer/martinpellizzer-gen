    "intro": "Cheilanthes kuhnii var. brandtii, commonly known as the Brandt's rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to arid and rocky habitats in North America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and can tolerate periods of drought, making it well-suited to harsh environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and geographic distribution compared to other members of the Cheilanthes genus."
