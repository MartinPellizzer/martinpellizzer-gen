    "intro": "Carex atrata var. conglomerata, commonly known as black sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear brownish-purple flowers. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along streambanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
