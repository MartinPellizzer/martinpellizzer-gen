It is a herbaceous perennial with lance-shaped leaves and delicate, bell-like flowers that are typically white or pale green. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and swampy areas. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts. Croomia heterosepala plays a vital role in its native ecosystem, supporting local pollinators and contributing to biodiversity."
