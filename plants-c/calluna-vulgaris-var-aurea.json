    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris var. aurea, commonly known as the golden heather, is a variant of the common heather native to Europe. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers, which contrast with its dark green foliage. This plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often found in heathlands and moorlands, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of these habitats. The golden heather is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
