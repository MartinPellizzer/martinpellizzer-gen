    "intro": "Cypripedium insigne var. chantinii, commonly known as the Chantin\u2019s lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a defining feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pink or white with a yellow lip, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this variety is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
