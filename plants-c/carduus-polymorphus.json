    "intro": "Carduus polymorphus, commonly known as the nodding thistle, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, and it is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant features a spiny, leafy stem with purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are arranged in a composite head. Carduus polymorphus is sometimes considered a weed but has also been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
