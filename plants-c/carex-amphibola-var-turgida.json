    "intro": "Carex amphibola var. turgida, commonly known as the swamp sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in moist to aquatic habitats, such as marshes and pond edges, and has a clump-forming growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, with roots adapted for water absorption. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, wind-pollinated flowers, which are usually green or brown in color. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in saturated soils and its ecological importance in supporting aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
