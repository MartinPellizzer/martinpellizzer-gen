    "intro": "Cleome paludosa var. brevipes, commonly known as swamp cleome, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in its moist environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture, often covered in fine pubescence. This variety is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds."
