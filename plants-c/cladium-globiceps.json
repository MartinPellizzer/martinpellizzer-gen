    "intro": "Cladium globiceps, commonly known as the globular spikerush, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that resembles a spiky globe, which gives it its common name. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments and often forms dense mats on the water's surface. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically floating or partially submerged. Cladium globiceps plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
