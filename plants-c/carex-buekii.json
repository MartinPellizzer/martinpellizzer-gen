    "intro": "Carex buekii, commonly known as the Buek's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled, triangular berries. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
