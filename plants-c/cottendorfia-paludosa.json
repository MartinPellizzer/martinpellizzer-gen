    "intro": "Cottendorfia paludosa, commonly known as the marsh bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are elongated and slightly hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Cottendorfia paludosa plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
