    "intro": "Coffea flavicans, commonly known as the yellow coffee plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly Ethiopia and Kenya. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to red, fleshy fruits containing seeds used for coffee production. Its leaves are elliptical and have a glossy appearance, and it thrives in shaded, humid environments. Due to its unique coloration and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less commercially cultivated species compared to other coffee plants."
