    "intro": "Caucalis divaricata, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Caucalis divaricata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas."
