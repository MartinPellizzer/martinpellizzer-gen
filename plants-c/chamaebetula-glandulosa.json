    "intro": "Chamaebetula glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular dwarf birch, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are often covered in glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in tundra or boreal forest ecosystems. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a modest amount of nectar that attracts pollinators like bees and flies. Chamaebetula glandulosa plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds."
