    "intro": "Chaenostoma halimifolium, commonly known as the white milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or mountainous regions. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a slightly hairy texture, and the stem is often covered in fine pubescence. The plant's milky sap, which is characteristic of the milkweed genus, can be toxic if ingested."
