    "intro": "Cymbopogon nervosus, commonly known as narrow-leaved lemon grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often aromatic and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its fragrant properties, it has been used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
