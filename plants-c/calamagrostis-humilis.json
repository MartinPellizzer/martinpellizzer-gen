    "intro": "Calamagrostis humilis, commonly known as the dwarf reed or narrowleaf reed, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and riverbanks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually narrow and slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers. Calamagrostis humilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
