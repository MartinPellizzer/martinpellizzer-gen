    "intro": "Crotalaria tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly crownflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces distinctive yellow or orange flowers that are clustered in racemes, often with a crown-like appearance. Its seeds are enclosed in small, triangular pods that split open when mature. Crotalaria tomentosa is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
