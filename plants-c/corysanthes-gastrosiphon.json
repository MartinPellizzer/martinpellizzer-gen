    "intro": "Corysanthes gastrosiphon, commonly known as the broad-leafed sandstone orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a unique, spurred lip that is often brightly colored. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in sandy soils. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
