    "intro": "Cestichis divergens, commonly known as the divergent cestichis, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Acanthaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep red. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich nature. Cestichis divergens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
