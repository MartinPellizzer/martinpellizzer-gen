    "intro": "Cyperus zollingeri var. condensatus, commonly known as the compact flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often inconspicuous, with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical structure makes it a common ornamental and invasive species in some regions."
