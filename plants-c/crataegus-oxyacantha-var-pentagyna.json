    "intro": "Crataegus oxyacantha var. pentagyna, commonly known as the five-lobed hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to ovate leaves with five distinct lobes, and clusters of white or pale pink flowers in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that ripen in late summer, which are edible but often used in jams and wines. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and along roadsides."
