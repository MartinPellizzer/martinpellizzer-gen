    "intro": "Crambe maritima, commonly known as sea kale, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant has basal leaves that are succulent and often covered in a waxy coating, helping it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods containing seeds. Crambe maritima is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils along sea shores, making it a hardy and resilient species."
