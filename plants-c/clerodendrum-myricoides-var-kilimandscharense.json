    "intro": "Clerodendrum myricoides var. kilimandscharense, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro clerodendrum, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and flowering habit."
