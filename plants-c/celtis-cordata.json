    "intro": "Celtis cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf silkthorn, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It has simple, ovate to elliptic leaves with a heart-shaped base, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by small, round, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. It is often found in moist soils along stream banks and in woodland areas. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
