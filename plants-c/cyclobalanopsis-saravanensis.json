    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis saravanensis, commonly known as the Saravan hill evergreen, is a species of evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its hard, durable wood. The plant produces small, cup-shaped fruits that contain one or two seeds, typical of the genus Cyclobalanopsis. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in dense evergreen forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
