    "intro": "Cassiope, commonly known as the mountain heather, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Ericaceae family. It is native to the northern hemisphere, particularly in regions with cold climates such as alpine areas and tundra. The plants typically have low-growing, evergreen shrubs with small, leathery leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red. Cassiope species are known for their ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and harsh environmental conditions. They play an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
