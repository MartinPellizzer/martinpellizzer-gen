    "intro": "Calandrinia minima, commonly known as the dwarf purslane, is a low-growing annual plant native to South America. It features fleshy, succulent leaves and stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to arid environments. Its botanical structure supports its role as a pioneer species in disturbed soils."
