    "intro": "Carduus nigrescens subsp. assoi, commonly known as the blackthorn thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers. The plant produces a rough, hairy stem that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its flowers are borne in dense, spherical clusters called capitula, and it is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine. The subspecies assoi is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and darker, more persistent foliage compared to the typical form."
