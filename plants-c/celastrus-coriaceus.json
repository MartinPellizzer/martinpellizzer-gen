It features small, opposite leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring, followed by small, spherical berries that ripen to red. It thrives in a variety of soils but prefers well-drained conditions. Celastrus coriaceus is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed sites."
