    "intro": "Coryphantha cornuta, commonly known as the horned cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in spines and are typically green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Coryphantha cornuta is adapted to arid environments, with succulent stems that store water and reduce transpiration. It plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various desert wildlife."
