    "intro": "Cercidium praecox, commonly known as the early flowering honey mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically gray-green and covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible pods containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Cercidium praecox is well adapted to drought conditions and is an important plant in desert ecosystems."
