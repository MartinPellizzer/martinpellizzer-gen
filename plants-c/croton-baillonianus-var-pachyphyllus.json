    "intro": "Croton baillonianus var. pachyphyllus, commonly known as the thick-leaf croton, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, thick, and often leathery leaves that can vary in color from green to reddish or purple. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. The thick, waxy leaves help the plant retain moisture in its native environment."
