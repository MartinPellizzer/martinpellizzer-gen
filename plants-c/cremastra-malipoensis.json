    "intro": "Cremastra malipoensis, commonly known as the Malipo moonflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are ovate and have a velvety texture, while its stems are slender and often hairy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
