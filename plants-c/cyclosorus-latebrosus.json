    "intro": "Cyclosorus latebrosus, commonly known as the creeping liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a differentiated stem and leaves, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Its leaves are usually small, ovate, and arranged in two rows along the stem, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. Cyclosorus latebrosus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
