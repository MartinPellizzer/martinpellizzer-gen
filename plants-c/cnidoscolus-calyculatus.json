    "intro": "Cnidoscolus calyculatus, commonly known as the Mexican giant hogweed, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a large herbaceous perennial that can grow up to 5 meters in height, featuring thick, ridged stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbel-like clusters, which are followed by spiny, berry-like fruits. Its leaves and stems contain toxic sap that can cause severe skin irritation, making it a potentially dangerous plant. Despite its harmful properties, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance."
