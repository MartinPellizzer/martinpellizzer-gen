It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale blue flowers. Its leaves are narrow and have a rough texture, adapted to thrive in dry, open habitats. Cyclopogon saccatus is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
