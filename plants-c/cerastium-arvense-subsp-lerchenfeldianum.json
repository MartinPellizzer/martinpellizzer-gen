    "intro": "Cerastium arvense subsp. lerchenfeldianum, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are typically arranged in umbels. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides or in woodland edges. Its botanical features make it a common species in temperate regions, though it is generally not cultivated for ornamental purposes."
