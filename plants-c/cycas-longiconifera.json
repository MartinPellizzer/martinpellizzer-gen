    "intro": "Cycas longiconifera, commonly known as the long-needle cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It is a slow-growing, long-lived species that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
