    "intro": "Ctenitis setosa, commonly known as the hairy sea holly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky bracts that surround the small, yellow flowers. The plant is typically found in coastal areas and sandy soils, where it thrives in well-drained conditions. Its leaves are covered in fine, hairy structures, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Ctenitis setosa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions."
