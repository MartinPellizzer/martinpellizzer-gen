    "intro": "Crossandrella, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The flowers are typically small and clustered, with five petals that are usually pale yellow or greenish in color. Crossandrella species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They are often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in disturbed soils due to their adaptability and rapid growth."
