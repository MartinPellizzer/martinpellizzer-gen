It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers with deep red veins contrasting against a white or pale pink background. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and slightly fleshy, adapted to store moisture in its natural habitat. Coenadenium holochilum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
