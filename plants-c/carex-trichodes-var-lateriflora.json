It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. This variant is distinguished by its laterally facing flowers, which give it its specific epithet \"lateriflora.\" It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands or along streambanks. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
