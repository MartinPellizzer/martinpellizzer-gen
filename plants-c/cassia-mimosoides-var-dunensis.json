    "intro": "Cassia mimosoides var. dunensis, commonly known as the Dunedale cassia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a small, shrub-like species that typically grows in coastal and sandy environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, fern-like flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments. The seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that develop after the flowers fade."
