    "intro": "Casearia grewiifolia var. insularis, commonly known as the island casearia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom throughout the year, followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
