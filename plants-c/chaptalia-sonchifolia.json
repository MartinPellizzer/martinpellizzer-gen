    "intro": "Chaptalia sonchifolia, commonly known as the Mexican dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its leaves are usually alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and resemble those of the common dandelion. Chaptalia sonchifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and digestive properties."
