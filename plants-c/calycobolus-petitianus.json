    "intro": "Calycobolus petitianus, commonly known as the moonlight orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the misty highlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, translucent petals that shimmer with a silvery sheen under moonlight, giving it its common name. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its unique ability to absorb moisture from the air, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom only during the night, releasing a subtle fragrance that attracts specific nocturnal pollinators. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is listed as an endangered species in its native habitat."
