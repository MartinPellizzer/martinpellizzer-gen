    "intro": "Celtis dioica, commonly known as the fragrant cedar or nettle tree, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It belongs to the Ulmaceae family and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are separate between male and female plants, making it dioecious. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that turns from green to red or black as it matures. Celtis dioica is often found in moist woodlands and along streambanks, contributing to local biodiversity."
