    "intro": "Cerastium holosteiforme, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Its compact form and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover in horticulture."
