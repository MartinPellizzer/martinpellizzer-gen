    "intro": "Cyrtandra \u00d7 hosakae, commonly known as the hybrid Hawaiian cyrtandra, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cyrtandra pedata and Cyrtandra hawaiiensis, both native to Hawaii. This plant is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments on the island of Hawaii. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
