    "intro": "Corethrogyne caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted corethrogyne, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It forms dense, clump-forming growth with slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant taxonomy."
