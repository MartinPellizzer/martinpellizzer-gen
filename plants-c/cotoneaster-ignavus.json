It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of white to pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. Cotoneaster ignavus is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to a variety of garden conditions."
