    "intro": "Cytisus canariensis, commonly known as the Canary Island broom, is a flowering shrub native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and can thrive in coastal areas. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
