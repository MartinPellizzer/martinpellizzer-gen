    "intro": "Cryophytum roseum, commonly known as the pink snowplant, is a rare alpine species native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking pink to magenta flowers that bloom in the early spring. The plant has a rosette of fleshy, succulent leaves that help it store water in its arid environment. It thrives in cold, moist conditions and is often found in rocky or alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
