    "intro": "Cornus stolonifera var. riparia, commonly known as the river dogwood, is a shrub native to the wetlands and riverbanks of eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red or purple berries that are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth margin and a slightly hairy underside. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in moist, poorly drained soils."
