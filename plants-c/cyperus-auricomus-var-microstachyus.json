    "intro": "Cyperus auricomus var. microstachyus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sedgeland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are often narrow and slightly hairy, with a distinctive blue-green coloration. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, three-lobed flowers, which are usually pale green to brownish in color. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
