    "intro": "Cordia longituba, commonly known as the long-stemmed cordia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often glandular-dotted. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
