    "intro": "Crocus annulatus var. albus, commonly known as the white crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It produces showy, fragrant flowers with white petals and a yellow center, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained soil in full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in gardens. The white crocus is also valued for its historical use in perfumery and as a source of saffron-like stigmas."
