It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers. The plants typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks in their natural habitat. Chiovendaea species are known for their intricate floral structures and vibrant yellow or orange hues. Due to habitat destruction, many species are now considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
