    "intro": "Cranichis longipetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, elongated flower spike that bears a single, showy orchid bloom. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or mountainous areas with high humidity. Its flowers typically bloom in late summer or early autumn, producing a unique, fragrant aroma. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
