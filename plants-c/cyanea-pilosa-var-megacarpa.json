    "intro": "Cyanea pilosa var. megacarpa, commonly known as the giant Cyanea, is a rare and striking member of the Malvaceae family. It is native to the Hawaiian Islands, where it thrives in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its large, fleshy, purple to reddish stems and broad, waxy leaves. Its flowers are showy, with five petals that range in color from white to pink, and it produces edible, fleshy fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
