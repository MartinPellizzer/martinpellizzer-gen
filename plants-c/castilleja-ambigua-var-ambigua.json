    "intro": "Castilleja ambigua var. ambigua, commonly known as the western paintbrush, is a flowering plant in the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for water and nutrients. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as meadows and woodland edges in the western United States. Its striking red to orange flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and the stems are often branched and covered in fine hairs."
