The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with a distinctive calyx that is larger than the typical variety. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
