    "intro": "Crinum bracteatum, commonly known as the Cape daisy or Cape lily, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are broad, strap-like, and often have a waxy surface. Crinum bracteatum is known for its strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies and beetles."
