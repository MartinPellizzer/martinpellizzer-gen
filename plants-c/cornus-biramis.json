    "intro": "Cornus biramis, commonly known as the two-branched cornel, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Cornus biramis is often found in forested areas and thrives in partial shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
