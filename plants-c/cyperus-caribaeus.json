    "intro": "Cyperus caribaeus, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, across tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually green or brown in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. Cyperus caribaeus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
