    "intro": "Cestrum diurnum var. portoricense, commonly known as the evening trumpetflower, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that open in the evening and emit a strong, fragrant scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and slightly hairy, while its stems are woody and often branched. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural spread in suitable habitats."
