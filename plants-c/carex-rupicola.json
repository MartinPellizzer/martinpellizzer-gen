    "intro": "Carex rupicola, commonly known as the rock sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. This plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in moist or wet environments such as stream banks or wetlands. It has fibrous roots and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate various environmental conditions."
