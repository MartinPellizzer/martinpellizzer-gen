    "intro": "Cochemiea hutchisoniana, commonly known as the Hutchison's cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus with a dense, branching structure that forms a rounded or cylindrical shape. The plant features green, ribbed stems that are covered with a layer of white, powdery bloom, which helps to reduce water loss. It produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are typically clustered at the tips of the branches. Cochemiea hutchisoniana is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
