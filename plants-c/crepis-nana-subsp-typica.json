    "intro": "Crepis nana subsp. typica, commonly known as the dwarf mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with rosettes of silver-gray, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. Its botanical features make it a characteristic component of early successional plant communities."
