    "intro": "Croton ciliatoglandulosus, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and large, palmately lobed leaves with a distinctive waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
