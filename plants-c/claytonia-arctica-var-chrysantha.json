    "intro": "Claytonia arctica var. chrysantha, commonly known as the golden mountain sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically succulent and have a slightly sour taste due to their high concentration of oxalic acid. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. This plant is often found in tundra and alpine meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
