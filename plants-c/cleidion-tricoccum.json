It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped leaves and spherical, spiky fruit capsules. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or green, followed by the development of its unique, woody fruits. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance, while its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil. The tree is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used historically for its sap and wood."
