    "intro": "Cactus mammillaris var. glaber, commonly known as the woolly mammillaria, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and thrives in full sun, requiring minimal water due to its succulent nature. Its flowers, which are usually pale yellow or pink, appear in early summer and are relatively small. Despite its delicate appearance, it is highly resilient, capable of surviving in harsh desert conditions."
