    "intro": "Cranichis sparrei, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
