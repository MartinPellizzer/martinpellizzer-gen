    "intro": "Cupressus sempervirens var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping Italian cypress, is a variety of the Italian cypress characterized by its cascading, drooping branches. It is a slow-growing evergreen conifer that typically reaches a height of 10 to 15 meters, with a narrow, columnar shape. The leaves are scale-like, dark green, and densely packed, giving the plant a lush, textured appearance. Its unique weeping habit makes it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes. The cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind."
