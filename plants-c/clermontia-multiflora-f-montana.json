    "intro": "Clermontia multiflora f. montana, commonly known as the mountain clermontia, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its foliage consists of broad, ovate leaves with a smooth texture, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
