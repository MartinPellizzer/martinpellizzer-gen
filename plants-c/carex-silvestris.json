    "intro": "Carex silvestris, commonly known as the woodland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, rushes, and similar plants. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Its grass-like foliage consists of narrow, grass-green leaves that form dense clumps. Carex silvestris produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, followed by three-sided, triangular seed heads that contribute to its ecological importance as a food source for various wildlife species."
