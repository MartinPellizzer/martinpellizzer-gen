    "intro": "Colobanthus squarrosus subsp. drucei, commonly known as the Antarctic hair grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the cold regions of the Southern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. This species is adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor environments and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its leaves are succulent, allowing it to retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
