    "intro": "Cakile cubensis, commonly known as Cuban sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many mustard plants, and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by pods that contain several seeds. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its saline and coastal environment. Cakile cubensis is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dune ecosystems where it plays a role in stabilizing the shoreline."
