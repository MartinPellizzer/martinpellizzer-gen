    "intro": "Crypsinus craspedosorus, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. Native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments with high levels of atmospheric moisture. The plant is characterized by its vibrant yellow-orange flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns resembling flames. Its leaves are typically broad and glossy, adapted to capture as much light as possible in its low-light habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Crypsinus craspedosorus is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
