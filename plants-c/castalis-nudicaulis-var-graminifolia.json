It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
