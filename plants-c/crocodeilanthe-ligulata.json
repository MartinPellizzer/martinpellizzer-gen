    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed fern, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that grow in a compact rosette formation. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on the trunks of trees in rainforests. Its small, clustered sporangia are located on the undersides of the fronds, which is a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
