    "intro": "Cionandra cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the island of Mauritius. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a slow growth rate and is known for its hard, dense wood, which is highly valued for its durability. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and limestone formations. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
