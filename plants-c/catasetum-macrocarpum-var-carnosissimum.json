    "intro": "Catasetum macrocarpum var. carnosissimum, commonly known as the meaty catasetum, is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is native to Central and South America. This species is characterized by its robust, fleshy leaves and striking, often fragrant flowers that can be yellow or orange in color. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The plant's unique morphology includes specialized structures called \"catas\" that aid in pollination by certain bees. Its botanical features make it a notable species for both horticultural and ecological studies."
