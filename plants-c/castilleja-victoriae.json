    "intro": "Castilleja victoriae, commonly known as the Victoria's paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, red-orange to yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in open, moist habitats such as meadows and forest edges. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
