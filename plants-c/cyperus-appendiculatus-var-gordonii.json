It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, thriving in areas with consistent moisture. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slightly hairy texture. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, which are adapted for dispersal in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
