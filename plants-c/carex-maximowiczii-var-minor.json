    "intro": "Carex maximowiczii var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to eastern Asia. It features dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in a loose, cylindrical inflorescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of ponds. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with wet or semi-wet conditions."
