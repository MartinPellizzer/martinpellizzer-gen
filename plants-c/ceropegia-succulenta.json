    "intro": "Ceropegia succulenta, commonly known as the string of hearts, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that are often arranged in pairs along its trailing stems. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, attracting specific pollinators like moths. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and hanging baskets."
