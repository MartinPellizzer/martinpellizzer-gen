    "intro": "Chenopodium physophora, commonly known as the smooth goosefoot, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist soils along streambanks and wetlands, preferring full sun to partial shade. The plant has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually smooth or slightly hairy. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces oblong, three-angled fruits. Chenopodium physophora is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
