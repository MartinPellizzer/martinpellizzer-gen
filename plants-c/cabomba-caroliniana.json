    "intro": "Cabomba caroliniana, commonly known as the water henweed, is a aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often submerged, making them less visible to the naked eye. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Cabomba caroliniana is often used in aquatic gardens and as a decorative element in ponds due to its elegant appearance."
