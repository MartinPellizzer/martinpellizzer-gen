    "intro": "Croton debilis, commonly known as the silver croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that often display shades of white, yellow, and green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Croton debilis is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
