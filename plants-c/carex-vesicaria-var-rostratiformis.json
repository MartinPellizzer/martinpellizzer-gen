    "intro": "Carex vesicaria var. rostratiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers that are wind-pollinated. This variety is distinguished by its narrow, elongated leaves and a distinctive, narrow shape that sets it apart from other Carex species."
