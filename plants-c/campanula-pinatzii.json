    "intro": "Campanula pinatzii, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, adapting to the harsh mountain environment. Campanula pinatzii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
