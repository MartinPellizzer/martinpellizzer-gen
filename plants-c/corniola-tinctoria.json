    "intro": "Corniola tinctoria, commonly known as the dye plant or Indian dye plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and oval-shaped leaves. The plant is notable for its ability to produce a yellow dye from its leaves, which has been traditionally used by indigenous communities. Corniola tinctoria thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it valuable both for its dye properties and as a subject of botanical study."
