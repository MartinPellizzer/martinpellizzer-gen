    "intro": "Cynanchum mucronatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family, which is known for its milky sap and showy flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Its latex contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
