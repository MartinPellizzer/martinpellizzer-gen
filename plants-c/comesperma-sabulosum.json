    "intro": "Comesperma sabulosum, commonly known as the sandflat lilly pilly, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coastlines, thriving in well-drained conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, providing a dense canopy that helps stabilize coastal dunes. Comesperma sabulosum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local biodiversity."
