    "intro": "Camptosema scarlatinum var. pohlianum, commonly known as the Pohlian's scarlet bellflower, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant scarlet or orange-red tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slight waxy coating. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
