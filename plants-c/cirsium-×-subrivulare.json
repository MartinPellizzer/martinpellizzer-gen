    "intro": "Cirsium \u00d7 subrivulare, commonly known as the narrowleaf thistle, is a hybrid plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Due to its prickly foliage, it is considered a potential weed in agricultural settings."
