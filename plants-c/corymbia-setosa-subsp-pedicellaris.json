    "intro": "Corymbia setosa subsp. pedicellaris, commonly known as the red bloodwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, red-brown to grey bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, edible capsules containing seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in semi-arid and tropical regions. The species is also valued for its timber, which is used in furniture and construction due to its durability and attractive grain."
