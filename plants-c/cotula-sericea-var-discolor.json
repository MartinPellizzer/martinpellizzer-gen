    "intro": "Cotula sericea var. discolor, commonly known as the silverleaf groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its finely hairy, silver-gray foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
