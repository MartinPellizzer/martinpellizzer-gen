    "intro": "Carex morii, commonly known as the Japanese sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known for their fibrous roots and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The flowering structure consists of small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes, which are often wind-pollinated."
