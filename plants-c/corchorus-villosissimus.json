It is characterized by its stout, woody stems covered in dense, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on erect, leafless stalks. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy texture.
