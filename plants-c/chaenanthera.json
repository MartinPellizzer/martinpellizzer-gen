    "intro": "Chaenanthera, commonly known as the sandverbena, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polemoniaceae. These plants are native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where they thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Chaenanthera species are typically low-growing shrubs or herbs with small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are often lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. They play an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native insects and small animals."
