    "intro": "Calanthe velutina, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves and striking, showy flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it can receive indirect light. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. Calanthe velutina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with specific humidity and light conditions."
