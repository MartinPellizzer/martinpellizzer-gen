    "intro": "Cestrum darienense, commonly known as the Darien nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in Panama and Colombia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring dark green, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale purple, which bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds. The plant has a somewhat toxic reputation due to the presence of alkaloids in its leaves and berries."
