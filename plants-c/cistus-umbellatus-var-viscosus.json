    "intro": "Cistus umbellatus var. viscosus, commonly known as sticky rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky resin, which gives the plant its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to Mediterranean climates. The resinous compounds of this plant have been used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
