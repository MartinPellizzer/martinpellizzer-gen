    "intro": "Cyrtococcum patens var. schmidtii, commonly known as the Schmidt's moss, is a rare and specialized liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, elongated leaves that are typically covered in a thick layer of rhizoids. This variety thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in crevices within temperate forest regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are typically small and inconspicuous, contributing to its limited dispersal. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Cyrtococcum patens var. schmidtii is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental stability and moisture conditions."
