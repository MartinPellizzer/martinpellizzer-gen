    "intro": "Centropodia, commonly known as the \"butterfly plant,\" is a rare and unusual species belonging to the family Cephalopodaceae. It is characterized by its unique, delicate, and ephemeral flowers that resemble the wings of a butterfly, which only last for a few hours. The plant is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in high-altitude, humid environments. Its botanical structure includes a short, erect stem with broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its rarity and short blooming period, Centropodia is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
