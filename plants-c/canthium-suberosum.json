It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and often showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with rough, hairy stems and alternate, ovate leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered in cyathia, which are cup-like structures typical of the spurge family. Canthium suberosum is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in disturbed or sandy soils."
