It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces feathery, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate aesthetic to its habitat. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshes, riverbanks, and other wetland environments. Calamagrostis lithuanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
