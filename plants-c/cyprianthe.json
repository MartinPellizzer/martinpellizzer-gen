    "intro": "Cyprianthe, commonly known as the \"Cyprian's flower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cypripediaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa and are characterized by their unique, often fragrant blooms. The flowers typically feature a single, showy lip petal that is highly specialized for attracting specific pollinators. Cyprianthe species are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks, and they often have thick, fleshy roots for water storage. Their botanical significance lies in their ecological role and their use in horticulture due to their ornamental value."
