    "intro": "Carpha avenacea, commonly known as narrowleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Americas. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, greenish to reddish flowers. Carpha avenacea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in wetland ecosystems."
