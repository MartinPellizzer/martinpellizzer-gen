It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, often hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Corydalis pseudotomentella is often found in rocky or forested habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly encountered in the wild."
