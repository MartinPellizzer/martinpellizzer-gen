    "intro": "Cymopterus, commonly known as the evening primrose, is a genus of flowering plants in the evening primrose family, Onagraceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, yellow or orange flowers that open in the late afternoon or evening. They are native to North America and are often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Cymopterus species typically have slender, branching stems and heart-shaped leaves. The flowers are pollinated primarily by moths and other nocturnal insects, which is reflected in their timing of bloom."
