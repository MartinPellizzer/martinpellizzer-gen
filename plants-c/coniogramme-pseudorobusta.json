    "intro": "Coniogramme pseudorobusta, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant has a complex rhizome system that allows it to spread rapidly in water bodies. Its fronds are bipinnate, with numerous small, finger-like leaves that provide surface area for gas exchange. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and marshes."
