    "intro": "Cornucopiae alopecuroides, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture.
