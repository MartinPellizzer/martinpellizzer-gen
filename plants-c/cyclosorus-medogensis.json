    "intro": "Cyclosorus medogensis, commonly known as the Tibetan water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in mountain lakes and streams. Its unique morphology includes a short, creeping rhizome and small, pinnately divided leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclosorus medogensis is considered an important species for ecological studies in alpine ecosystems."
