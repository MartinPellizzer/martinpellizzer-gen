    "intro": "Crocus fibroannulatus, commonly known as the fibrous-crown crocus, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It produces showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive, fibrous crown structure that gives it its scientific name. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils, and it is relatively drought-tolerant. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and hardy nature."
