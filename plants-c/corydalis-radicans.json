    "intro": "Corydalis radicans, commonly known as creeping larkspur, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in opposite pairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Corydalis radicans is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils."
