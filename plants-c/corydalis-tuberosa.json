It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces clusters of delicate, spurred flowers in shades of pink, red, and purple, typically blooming in spring. Its foliage consists of heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. Corydalis tuberosa is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its historical use in herbal remedies."
