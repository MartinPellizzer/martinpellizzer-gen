    "intro": "Carex scabra, commonly known as the rough sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, streambanks, and woodland edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
