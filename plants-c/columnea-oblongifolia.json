    "intro": "Columnea oblongifolia, commonly known as the oblongleaf flame flower, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling flames. The plant has opposite, ovate to oblong-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Columnea oblongifolia is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings due to its ornamental value."
