    "intro": "Centaurea setifera, commonly known as the slender centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as rocky soils and open fields. Centaurea setifera is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered a hardy, resilient species."
