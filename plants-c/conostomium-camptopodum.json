It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating at the water's surface. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in dense clusters, and it reproduces both sexually and vegetatively. Conostomium camptopodum plays a role in stabilizing aquatic habitats and providing food for various aquatic organisms."
