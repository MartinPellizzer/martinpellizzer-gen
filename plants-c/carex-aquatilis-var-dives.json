    "intro": "Carex aquatilis var. dives, commonly known as the water sedge, is a wetland plant native to North America. It is a perennial herb with grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces spikes of small, pale brown flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. Its dense growth helps stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
