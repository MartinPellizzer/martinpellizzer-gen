    "intro": "Cepa cernua, commonly known as the nodding onion, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers that droop downward. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its bulbous roots are edible and have a mild onion-like flavor, making it a useful plant in some culinary traditions. It is also known for its ability to naturalize and spread readily in suitable environments."
