    "intro": "Cotoneaster prostratus, commonly known as the creeping cotoneaster, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil. Cotoneaster prostratus is relatively drought-tolerant and suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover."
