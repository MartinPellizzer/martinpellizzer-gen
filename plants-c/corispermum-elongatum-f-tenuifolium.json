    "intro": "Corispermum elongatum f. tenuifolium, commonly known as the slender-leaved glassworts, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce water loss, typical of plants in arid or coastal areas. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are pollinated by wind. Its root system is extensive, helping it anchor in sandy or salty soils. This variety is often found in salt marshes and coastal dunes, contributing to soil stabilization and ecosystem resilience."
