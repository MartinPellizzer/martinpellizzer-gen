    "intro": "Carlina vulgaris subsp. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate cudweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features basal rosettes of silver-gray leaves and produces yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale blue ray florets. Its inflorescence is a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family, and it blooms from late summer to early autumn. The species is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
