    "intro": "Coffea australis, commonly known as the Australian coffee plant, is a species native to the island of New Guinea. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows to a height of about 2 to 3 meters. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by red, fleshy berries containing the seeds used for coffee. Its leaves are glossy and elliptical, and it thrives in tropical climates with high humidity. Despite its name, it is not widely cultivated for commercial coffee production."
