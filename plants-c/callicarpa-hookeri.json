It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by showy clusters of red berries in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and thrives in partial shade to full sun. Its leaves are elliptical with a glossy green surface and turn reddish in the autumn. The berries are not only ornamental but also attract birds and other wildlife."
