    "intro": "Cremastosperma stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved burr medic, is a perennial leguminous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by cylindrical, hairy pods that contain flattened, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and shrubland habitats. Cremastosperma stenophyllum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil rehabilitation and as a forage plant."
