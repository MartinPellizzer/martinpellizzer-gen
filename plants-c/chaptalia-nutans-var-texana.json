It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in umbels, typical of the carrot family, and bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in prairies and open woodlands, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
