    "intro": "Coffea bonnieri var. diversifolia, commonly known as the diversified coffee plant, is a species native to the high altitudes of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its elliptical leaves that vary in color from dark green to reddish hues, especially on the underside. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries containing the seeds used for coffee. It prefers cool, moist climates and is often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and unique characteristics, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
