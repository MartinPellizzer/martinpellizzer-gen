    "intro": "Crepis brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-fruited hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and western Asia, typically found in grassy areas and along roadsides. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that are surrounded by a series of bracts. Its fruit is a dry, cylindrical achene with a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Crepis brachycarpa is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
