    "intro": "Cyperus andinus, commonly known as the Andean sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Cyperus andinus produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered at the ends of its stems. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
