It is a herbaceous perennial that produces small, yellow flowers with five petals. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and twining stems that allow it to climb or trail along the ground. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
