It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley. The plant is characterized by its feathery leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in sandy or muddy substrates near the shoreline. Its unique morphology aids in its adaptation to tidal and wave action in its natural habitat."
