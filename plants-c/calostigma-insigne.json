    "intro": "Calostigma insigne, commonly known as the showy bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright stems covered in soft, hairy foliage and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. The flowers are typically tubular at the base and flare out into a wide, bell-like shape, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early summer."
