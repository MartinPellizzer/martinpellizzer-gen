    "intro": "Conophytum retusum, commonly known as the horned stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, triangular leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water to thrive. Conophytum retusum is prized in rock gardens for its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
