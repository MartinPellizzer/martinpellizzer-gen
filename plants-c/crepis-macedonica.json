    "intro": "Crepis macedonica, commonly known as Macedonian hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the Balkan region. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. It produces achenes with pappus, which aid in wind dispersal. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in parts of its native range."
