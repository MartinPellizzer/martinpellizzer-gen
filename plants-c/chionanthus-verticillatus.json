    "intro": "Chionanthus verticillatus, commonly known as the fringe tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. The fringe tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
