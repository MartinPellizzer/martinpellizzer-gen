It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray blades that are covered in a dense layer of hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikelets. Cynodon virgatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in erosion control due to its hardy nature."
