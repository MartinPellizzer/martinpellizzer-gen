    "intro": "Comptonella oreophila var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed mountain lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific high-altitude regions. It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its slender, elongated stems and clustered, showy white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
