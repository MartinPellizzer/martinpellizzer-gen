    "intro": "Cypripedium subtropicum, commonly known as the subtropical lady's slipper, is a rare and elegant orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper, which is a key feature in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, preferring rich, organic soil. Its flowers are usually pale pink to white, with a single, prominent spur at the base of the lip. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
