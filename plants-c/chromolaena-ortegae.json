    "intro": "Chromolaena ortegae, commonly known as the orange tree or false hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and showy, orange-red flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Its rapid growth and invasive tendencies make it a significant weed in many regions."
