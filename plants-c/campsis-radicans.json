    "intro": "Campsis radicans, commonly known as trumpet vine, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces vibrant, tubular red-orange flowers in late summer, which are highly attractive to hummingbirds and other pollinators. Its showy blooms are followed by orange-red capsules that contain numerous seeds. Campsis radicans is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
