    "intro": "Ceratoides lenensis, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has silvery, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It is adapted to sandy soils and can survive in extreme temperatures. Ceratoides lenensis plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
