    "intro": "Crataegus fennica kalmii, commonly known as the Kalm's hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northern Europe and parts of Russia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but generally not favored by humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks."
