    "intro": "Cyperus ruizianus, commonly known as the Ruiz's flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along water bodies, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its slender, triangular stems are often clustered, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Cyperus ruizianus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
