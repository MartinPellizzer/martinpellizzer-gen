    "intro": "Clistoyucca, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent flowers that glow faintly in the dark. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially harmful to animals and humans. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Clistoyucca is considered a rare and poorly understood species in botanical studies. Its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments make it a subject of scientific interest and conservation efforts."
