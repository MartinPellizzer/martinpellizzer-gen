    "intro": "Calamagrostis arundinacea var. laxiflora, commonly known as the silky false panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, arching stems that produce clusters of narrow, silky, silver-green leaves. The plant is characterized by its delicate, panicle-like inflorescence that blooms in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
