    "intro": "Coffea liberica var. aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange coffee plant, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the Liberica coffee species. It is characterized by its distinctive orange-red flowers and dark, glossy leaves. The plant is native to West Africa and thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Its fruits are larger than those of typical coffee plants and contain a single large seed. Despite its unique appearance, it is not widely cultivated for commercial coffee production due to its low yield and complex flavor profile."
