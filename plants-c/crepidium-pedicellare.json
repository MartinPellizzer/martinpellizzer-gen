    "intro": "Crepidium pedicellare, commonly known as the pedicellate orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forest understories. The plant has a slender, erect stem with a few leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
