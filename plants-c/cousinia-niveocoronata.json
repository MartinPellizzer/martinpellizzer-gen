    "intro": "Cousinia niveocoronata, commonly known as the white-capped cushion plant, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense, compact cushions to conserve moisture and withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its rugged habitat. Its leaves are typically silver-gray, covered in a fine layer of hair that helps reduce water loss. Cousinia niveocoronata is well adapted to high-altitude and semi-desert environments, making it a resilient species in extreme climates."
