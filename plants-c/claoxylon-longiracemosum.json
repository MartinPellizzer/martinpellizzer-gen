    "intro": "Claoxylon longiracemosum, commonly known as the long-branch claoxylon, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense canopy, with leaves that are typically alternate and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, lowland areas and is often found in primary rainforest ecosystems. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
