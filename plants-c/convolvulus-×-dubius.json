    "intro": "Convolvulus \u00d7 dubius, commonly known as the hybrid bindweed, is a perennial flowering plant characterized by its twining stems and heart-shaped leaves. It produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in clusters. The plant is native to regions of Europe and Asia and is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in gardens. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in various soil types and is known for its aggressive growth habit. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
