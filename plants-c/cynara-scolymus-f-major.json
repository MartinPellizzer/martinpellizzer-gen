It is characterized by its large, robust leaves and a substantial, edible flower head. The plant is a perennial in mild climates but is typically grown as an annual in temperate regions. Its leaves are broad and have a fibrous texture, while the flower head consists of dense, fleshy bracts. The botanical features make it well-suited for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
