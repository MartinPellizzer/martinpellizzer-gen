    "intro": "Cocculus oblongifolius, commonly known as the African morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces smooth, elongated berries that turn from green to yellow or orange as they mature. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a twining stem that allows it to climb and spread rapidly. It is often found in moist, shaded areas and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
