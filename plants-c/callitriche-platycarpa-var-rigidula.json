    "intro": "Callitriche platycarpa var. rigidula, commonly known as rigid water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and ditches. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences near the water surface. This species is notable for its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving waters and its role in supporting aquatic ecosystems."
