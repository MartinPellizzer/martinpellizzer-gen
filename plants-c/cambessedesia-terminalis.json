    "intro": "Cambessedesia terminalis, commonly known as the desert willow, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of pink, red, or purple. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration. Cambessedesia terminalis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
