It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. It is often found in scrublands and coastal areas, where it contributes to the local biodiversity. The subspecies is distinguished by its deeply wrinkled leaves and smaller flowers compared to the typical form of Cistus ladanifer."
