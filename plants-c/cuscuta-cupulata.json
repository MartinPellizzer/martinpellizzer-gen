    "intro": "Cuscuta cupulata, commonly known as the golden dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition. It produces small, yellow flowers and has a distinctive, thread-like appearance with numerous tiny branches. The plant is often found growing on various hosts such as grasses, shrubs, and even other flowering plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas readily. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and natural vegetation."
