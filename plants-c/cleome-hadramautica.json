It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pink flowers that resemble spider legs. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. It prefers well-drained soil and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Cleome hadramautica is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
