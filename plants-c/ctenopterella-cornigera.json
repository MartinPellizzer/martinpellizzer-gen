    "intro": "Ctenopterella cornigera, commonly known as the cornigera fern, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its small, intricate fronds that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are covered in fine, scale-like structures that help reduce water loss in its moist habitat. Ctenopterella cornigera is known for its unique reproductive structures, including tiny, spore-bearing capsules that are often clustered along the fronds."
