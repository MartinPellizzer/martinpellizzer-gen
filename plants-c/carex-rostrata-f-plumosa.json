    "intro": "Carex rostrata f. plumosa, commonly known as the plumose tussock sedge, is a variant of the tufted sedge native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its soft, feathery foliage that gives it a delicate, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in marshy or pond margins, and prefers full to partial sunlight. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike that bears small, greenish-brown flowers. This ornamental plant is valued in wetland gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
