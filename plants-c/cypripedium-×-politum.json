    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 politum, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and highly sought-after orchid species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is a hybrid between Cypripedium yunnanense and Cypripedium micranthum, exhibiting a combination of characteristics from both parent species. The plant features a distinctive, showy flower with a pouch-like lip, which is a key adaptation for attracting specific pollinators. Its leaves are typically elliptical and arranged in a rosette, and it thrives in cool, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Due to its beauty and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
