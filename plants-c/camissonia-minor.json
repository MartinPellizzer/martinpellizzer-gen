It typically reaches a height of about 5 to 10 centimeters and features a cluster of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant has a slender, branching stem with opposite leaves that are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Camissonia minor is often found in dry, sunny environments and is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils."
