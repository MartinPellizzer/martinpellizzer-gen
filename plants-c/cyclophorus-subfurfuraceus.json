    "intro": "Cyclophorus subfurfuraceus, commonly known as the African sand boa, is a species of colubrid snake native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its slender body and smooth, sand-colored scales that aid in camouflage within its arid habitat. The snake's diet primarily consists of small mammals, birds, and other reptiles, which it hunts using ambush tactics. Its nocturnal behavior and ability to burrow make it well adapted to the harsh conditions of its environment. Despite its venomous bite, it is not considered a significant threat to humans."
