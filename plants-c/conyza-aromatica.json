    "intro": "Conyza aromatica, commonly known as blueweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It features slender, branched stems that grow up to 1 meter in height, often with a bluish-gray hue. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom from late spring to early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often have a faint aromatic scent. Conyza aromatica is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
