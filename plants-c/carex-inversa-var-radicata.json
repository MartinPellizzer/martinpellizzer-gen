    "intro": "Carex inversa var. radicata, commonly known as the upland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along stream edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. The leaves are narrow and usually have a slight sheen, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
