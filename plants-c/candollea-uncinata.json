It is native to the Andes Mountains of South America, where it typically grows in high-altitude regions. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. It is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
