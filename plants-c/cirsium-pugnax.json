    "intro": "Cirsium pugnax, commonly known as the bristly thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower heads. Cirsium pugnax is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth and persistent seed production."
