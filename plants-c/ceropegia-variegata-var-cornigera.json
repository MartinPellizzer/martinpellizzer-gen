    "intro": "Ceropegia variegata var. cornigera, commonly known as the \"string of hearts,\" is a trailing succulent native to South Africa. It features thin, fleshy stems that often curl into heart-shaped leaves, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, attracting specific pollinators like moths. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and ease of care make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
