    "intro": "Centaurea boissieri var. macracantha, commonly known as the Armenian star-thistle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features wiry stems and spiny leaves, typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant produces striking purple to pink flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and invasive tendencies in some regions, it is both admired and managed in agricultural and ecological contexts."
