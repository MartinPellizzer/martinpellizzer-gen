    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 alfredii, commonly known as the Chinese lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive, pouch-like flower that resembles a slipper, typically in shades of pink or white. The plant produces a single, showy flower per stem, which blooms in late spring or early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with rich, humus-filled soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
