It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries in the autumn. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and can thrive in full sun. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in arid landscapes."
