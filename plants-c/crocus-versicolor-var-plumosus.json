    "intro": "Crocus versicolor var. plumosus, commonly known as the plumose crocus, is a striking bulbous perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive, plumose (feathery) appearance, which gives it its common name. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. Its flowers are typically 3\u20134 inches in diameter and have a subtle, sweet fragrance. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, early-season display."
