    "intro": "Clematopsis scabiosifolia, commonly known as the scabious clematis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and showy, often pink or white flowers. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically simple, alternate, and have a rough, hairy texture, which helps it adapt to its arid or semi-arid habitats. Clematopsis scabiosifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil with full sun."
