    "intro": "Cyclamen hederifolium subsp. hederifolium, commonly known as the Persian cyclamen, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and the Caucasus. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, and its flowers are typically pink or red, with five petals and a spurred petal at the base. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often cultivated as a decorative indoor plant. It produces tubers that store nutrients, allowing it to survive periods of dormancy during winter. Cyclamen hederifolium subsp. hederifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
