    "intro": "Cyperorchis insignis, commonly known as the noble sedge orchid, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and striking, showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers, which are usually pink or purple, bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Cyperorchis insignis is a relatively rare species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
