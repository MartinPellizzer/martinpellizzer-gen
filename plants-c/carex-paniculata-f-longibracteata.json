    "intro": "Carex paniculata f. longibracteata, commonly known as the long bract sedge, is a variant of the panicled sedge species. It is characterized by its elongated bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. This plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and pond edges. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, three-lobed flowers. The foliage is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic life."
