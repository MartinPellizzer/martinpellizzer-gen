    "intro": "Colutea americana, commonly known as American hogweed, is a perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy pink or purple flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks. Due to its tall stature and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
