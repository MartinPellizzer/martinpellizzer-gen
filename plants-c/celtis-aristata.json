    "intro": "Celtis aristata, commonly known as the velvetleaf hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn red in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by white, fleshy fruits that are edible for some wildlife. Celtis aristata thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in riparian zones and disturbed areas. Its adaptability makes it a common sight in arid and semi-arid regions."
