    "intro": "Cinnamomum marlipoense, commonly known as the Marlipo cinnamon tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes other aromatic plants such as laurel and bay leaf. The tree is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its bark and leaves are used in traditional medicine and for their aromatic properties, though it is less commercially significant than other cinnamon species."
