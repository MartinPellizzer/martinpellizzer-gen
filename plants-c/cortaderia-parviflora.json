    "intro": "Cortaderia parviflora, commonly known as the narrowleaf fountain grass, is a perennial grass native to South America. It features tall, slender stems that grow in dense clumps, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flower spikes during the summer months, which are arranged in a fountain-like shape. It is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in coastal areas add to its horticultural appeal."
