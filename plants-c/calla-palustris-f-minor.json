    "intro": "Calla palustris f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf swamp calla, is a variant of the swamp calla, characterized by its smaller size and distinctive white, spathaceous bracts. It is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in North America, particularly in the eastern United States. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are arrowhead-shaped and glossy, while its flowers are highly ornamental, adding aesthetic value to wetland habitats. It plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
