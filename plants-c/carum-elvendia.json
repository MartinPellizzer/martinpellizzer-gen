    "intro": "Carum elvendia, commonly known as the Alpine caraway, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other aromatic herbs like parsley and dill. The plant produces small white or greenish flowers arranged in umbels, and its leaves are finely divided, giving it a feathery appearance. Carum elvendia is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its seeds are used in traditional medicine and have a mild, caraway-like aroma."
