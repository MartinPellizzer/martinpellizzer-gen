    "intro": "Chrysocyathus ramosus, commonly known as the branched cup coral, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the order Scleractinia. It is characterized by its calcareous skeleton, which forms a cup-like structure with branching extensions. This species is typically found in shallow tropical waters, where it thrives on coral reefs. The polyps of Chrysocyathus ramosus are often covered in symbiotic algae, contributing to its vibrant coloration. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a role in reef biodiversity and provides habitat for various marine organisms."
