    "intro": "Cylindrolobus pinguis, commonly known as the broad-leafed sandbur, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a perennial herb with a robust, creeping stem that often forms dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spiny, spherical fruits. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Cylindrolobus pinguis is often found in sandy soils and can thrive in disturbed areas."
