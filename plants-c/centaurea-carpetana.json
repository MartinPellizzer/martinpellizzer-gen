It is characterized by its upright, sparsely branched stems and blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Centaurea carpetana is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
