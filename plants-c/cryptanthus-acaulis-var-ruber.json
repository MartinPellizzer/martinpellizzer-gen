    "intro": "Cryptanthus acaulis var. ruber, commonly known as the red-stemmed forest bell, is a striking evergreen perennial native to Brazil. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with broad, leathery leaves that range from dark green to reddish-brown. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, typically in shades of pink to red, during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soil and requires partial to full shade, making it ideal for woodland gardens. Due to its compact size and vibrant color, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and as a container plant."
