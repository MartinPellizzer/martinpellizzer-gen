    "intro": "Chlamydacanthus dichrostachyus, commonly known as the silverleaf lantana, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that transition from white to pink or red as they mature, adding visual interest throughout the growing season. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it can become invasive in certain environments, requiring careful management."
