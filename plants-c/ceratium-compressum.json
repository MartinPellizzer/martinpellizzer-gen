    "intro": "Ceratium compressum, commonly known as the compressed hornwort, is a freshwater algae belonging to the order Coleochaetales. It is characterized by its filamentous structure with a compressed, ribbon-like thallus. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and is often found in ponds and slow-moving streams. Its morphology includes a central axis with lateral branches that bear spore-producing structures. Ceratium compressum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to primary production and serving as a food source for various aquatic organisms."
