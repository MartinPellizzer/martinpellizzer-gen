    "intro": "Crataegus pruinosa var. rugosa, commonly known as the rugose hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its grayish-white, peeling bark and thorny branches, which are typical of the Crataegus genus. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in the spring, followed by red, juicy berries in the fall. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges, and they turn red or orange in the autumn. This species is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
