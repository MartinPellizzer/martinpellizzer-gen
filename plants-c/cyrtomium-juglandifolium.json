    "intro": "Cyrtomium juglandifolium, commonly known as the walnut-leaf holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery, serrated fronds that resemble the shape of a walnut leaf. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are arranged in a distinct pattern. Cyrtomium juglandifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide dense, year-round foliage in shaded garden settings."
