    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris praematura, commonly known as the early peppergrass, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, white flowers that bloom early in the growing season. The plant produces distinctive heart-shaped pods, which contain several seeds. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been naturalized in various regions around the world. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments."
