    "intro": "Cardamine fallax, commonly known as the Appalachian water shield, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Cardamine fallax is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability in wetland areas."
