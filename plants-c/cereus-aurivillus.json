    "intro": "Cereus aurivillus, commonly known as the yellow night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are covered in spiny, ribbed structures. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white and yellow. These flowers have a strong, sweet scent that attracts nocturnal pollinators like moths. Cereus aurivillus is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
