    "intro": "Ctenitis subtripinnata, commonly known as the three-pinnate sea palm, is a marine fern found in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Ctenophyllaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, feathery fronds that resemble a sea palm. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with numerous branches that produce pinnate leaves. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, adapted to withstand wave action. Ctenitis subtripinnata plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for small marine organisms."
