    "intro": "Claytonia lanceolata var. sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessileleaf springbeauty, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features basal rosettes of elliptic to ovate leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack distinct petioles. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its foliage and flowers are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its cool, humid habitat."
