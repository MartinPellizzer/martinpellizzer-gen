    "intro": "Cedrus deodara, commonly known as the Deodar cedar, is a tall evergreen conifer native to the western Himalayas. It is characterized by its pyramidal shape, glaucous-blue foliage, and distinctive, flaky, reddish-brown bark. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into winged seeds, facilitating wind pollination and seed dispersal. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and aromatic qualities, often used in construction and furniture. The plant is also popular in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of climates."
