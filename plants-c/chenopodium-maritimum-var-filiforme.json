    "intro": "Chenopodium maritimum var. filiforme, commonly known as sea blite, is a halophytic plant adapted to coastal environments. It thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found in estuaries and tidal zones. The plant has slender, thread-like leaves that reduce water loss in salty conditions. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces dry, three-angled fruits. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
