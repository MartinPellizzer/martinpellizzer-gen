    "intro": "Cenchrus crinitus, commonly known as hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and sandy environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
