It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant features a basal rosette of elongated, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in humid conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a distinctive hood-like structure over the reproductive organs. This orchid is known for its delicate appearance and is often found in association with other epiphytic and terrestrial orchid species."
