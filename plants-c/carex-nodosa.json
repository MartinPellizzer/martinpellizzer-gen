    "intro": "Carex nodosa, commonly known as the nodular sedge, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, ribbed leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
