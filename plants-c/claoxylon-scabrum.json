    "intro": "Claoxylon scabrum, commonly known as the rough-leafed ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, rugged bark and dark, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine, scaly texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, spiky fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. Claoxylon scabrum thrives in humid, lowland tropical forests and is often found in secondary growth areas."
