    "intro": "Cirsium macrostylon, commonly known as the tall thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has deeply lobed, silvery-green leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its root system is fibrous and adapted for anchoring in rocky or sandy soils. Cirsium macrostylon plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
