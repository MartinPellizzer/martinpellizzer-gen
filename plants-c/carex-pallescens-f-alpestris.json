    "intro": "Carex pallescens f. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous environments. It has a clump-forming growth habit and is adapted to cold climates. Its foliage is typically a pale green, which helps it conserve energy in harsh conditions."
