    "intro": "Critoniopsis triflosculosa, commonly known as the three-flowered critoniopsis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
