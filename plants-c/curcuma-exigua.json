    "intro": "Curcuma exigua, commonly known as the dwarf turmeric, is a rhizomatous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are often overlooked due to its more prominent rhizomes. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine and can be harvested for their curcumin content. Curcuma exigua thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for both ornamental and medicinal purposes."
