It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are wind-pollinated, followed by edible nuts enclosed in a thick, husky shell. The plant is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ecological and horticultural purposes."
