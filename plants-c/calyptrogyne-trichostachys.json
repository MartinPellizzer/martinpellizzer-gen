    "intro": "Calyptrogyne trichostachys, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in saline or brackish environments, making it well-adapted to coastal and estuarine habitats. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sediments, contributing to shoreline erosion control. Calyptrogyne trichostachys is often found in mangrove swamps and salt marshes, where it plays a role in ecological succession."
