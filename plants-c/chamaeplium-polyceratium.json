    "intro": "Chamaeplium polyceratium, commonly known as the alpine cowberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is adapted to acidic, nutrient-poor soils. The plant features small, dark green leaves and produces clusters of bright red berries that are edible for both humans and wildlife. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in harsh alpine conditions make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems. The berries are also used in traditional herbal medicine for their antioxidant properties."
