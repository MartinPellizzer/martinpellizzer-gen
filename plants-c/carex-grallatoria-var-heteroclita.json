    "intro": "Carex grallatoria var. heteroclita, commonly known as the heterogeneous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has grass-like leaves that are usually narrow and linear, with a distinct midrib. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are often arranged in a cylindrical or spicate structure. The species is characterized by its variability in leaf morphology, which contributes to its common name."
