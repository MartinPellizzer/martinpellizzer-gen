    "intro": "Colanthelia longipetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled colanthelia, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial species. The plant is characterized by its elongated, stiff petioles that support its broad, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowering inflorescence consists of small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
