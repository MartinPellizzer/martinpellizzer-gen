    "intro": "Cactus scolymoides, commonly known as the desert cactus, is a species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its spiny stems and ability to store water efficiently, which allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant typically grows in low, sprawling forms, with some species developing into shrubs or small trees. Its flowers are often yellow or greenish-yellow, and they bloom during the warmer months. Cactus scolymoides plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert animals."
