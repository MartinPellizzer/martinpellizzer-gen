    "intro": "Calamagrostis persica, commonly known as Persian reed, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a landscape accent. Its botanical features make it an attractive choice for both ecological and ornamental horticulture."
