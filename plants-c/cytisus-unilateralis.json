    "intro": "Cytisus unilateralis, commonly known as the single-sided broom, is a flowering shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, spindly growth habit and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its unique morphology, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens."
