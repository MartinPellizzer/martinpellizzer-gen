    "intro": "Cumulopuntia zehnderi, commonly known as the Zehnder's cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces dense clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Cumulopuntia zehnderi is well adapted to extreme temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient member of its ecosystem."
