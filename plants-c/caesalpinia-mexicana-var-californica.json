    "intro": "Caesalpinia mexicana var. californica, commonly known as the California coral tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features palmate leaves with three to five leaflets, and its most distinctive characteristic is its bright red, flame-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces long, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions."
