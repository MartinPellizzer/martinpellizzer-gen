    "intro": "Ceratophyllum floridanum, commonly known as the Florida hornwort, is a unique aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial plant that grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. The plant has whorled leaves that are thick and fleshy, often with a slight horn-like appearance, which gives it its common name. It does not have true roots but instead has rhizoids that anchor it to substrates. Ceratophyllum floridanum is known for its ability to provide habitat for small aquatic organisms and improve water clarity by absorbing nutrients."
