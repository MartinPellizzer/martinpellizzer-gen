    "intro": "Colysis elliptica var. simplicifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaf colysis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features slender, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with pale blue or violet petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system consists of fibrous roots that help anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
