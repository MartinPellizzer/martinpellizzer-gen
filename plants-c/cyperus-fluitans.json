    "intro": "Cyperus fluitans, commonly known as floating flatsedge, is a herbaceous plant that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and is often found in shallow water or moist soil. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. Cyperus fluitans is an aquatic or semi-aquatic species, often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is commonly found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of rivers."
