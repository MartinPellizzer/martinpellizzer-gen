It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizome system is robust, allowing it to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and horticulture due to their ornamental value."
