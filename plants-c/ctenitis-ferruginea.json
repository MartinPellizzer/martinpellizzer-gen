    "intro": "Ctenitis ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty ctenitis, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Ctenitis ferruginea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
