    "intro": "Canna jaegeriana, commonly known as the red canna, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces vibrant orange-red flowers with three prominent stamens, which bloom in late summer. Canna jaegeriana thrives in moist, well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
