    "intro": "Coelogyne dayana var. massangeana, commonly known as the Massangeana orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a sympodial orchid with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in tropical climates. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and red, often with a distinctive red lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
