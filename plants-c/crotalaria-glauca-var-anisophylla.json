It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture, and its flowers are typically yellow with prominent purple veins. The plant is native to the Americas and is often found in disturbed soils and agricultural areas. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many regions."
