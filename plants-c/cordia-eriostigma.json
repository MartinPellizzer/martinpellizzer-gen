    "intro": "Cordia eriostigma, commonly known as the small-leaved cordia, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its simple, opposite, elliptical leaves that are usually leathery and dark green. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by orange to red, fleshy fruits that are edible. Its bark is smooth and often has a reddish or brownish hue, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Cordia eriostigma is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in various soil types."
