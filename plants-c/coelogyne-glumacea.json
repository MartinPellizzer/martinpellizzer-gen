    "intro": "Coelogyne glumacea, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has long, slender pseudobulbs and linear, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Coelogyne glumacea is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
