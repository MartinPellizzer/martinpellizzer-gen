    "intro": "Campylocentrum labiakii, commonly known as the Labiak's starling orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns resembling the markings of a starling bird. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves are slender and strap-like, often clustered at the base of the plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Campylocentrum labiakii is considered a conservation concern."
