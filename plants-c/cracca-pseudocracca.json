    "intro": "Cracca pseudocracca, commonly known as the narrow-leafed cracca, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and rocky outcrops, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a distinctive grayish-green coloration due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing small yellow blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
