    "intro": "Cepobaculum trilamellatum, commonly known as the three-layered bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its specialized bladder-like structures that trap small prey, aiding in its nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor water environments. The plant exhibits a filamentous growth form with multicellular structures that facilitate both photosynthesis and predation. Its morphology includes three distinct lamellae, which contribute to its classification and ecological function. Cepobaculum trilamellatum is typically found in freshwater habitats, where it plays a minor but ecologically significant role in aquatic ecosystems."
