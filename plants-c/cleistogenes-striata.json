    "intro": "Cleistogenes striata, commonly known as the stripe grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves with distinct longitudinal stripes, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides and fields, thriving in full sun. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers, which are primarily wind-pollinated. Cleistogenes striata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in various habitats."
