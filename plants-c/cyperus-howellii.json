    "intro": "Cyperus howellii, commonly known as Howell's flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, grass-like stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which help it thrive in moist environments. Its inflorescence consists of small, clustered spikes that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Cyperus howellii is often found in disturbed or wetland habitats and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
