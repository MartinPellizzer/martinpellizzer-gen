    "intro": "Coffea tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled coffee plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The plant is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of white flowers that give way to red, fleshy berries. While it is not widely cultivated for commercial coffee production, it is valued for its ornamental qualities and potential medicinal uses. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and scientific study."
