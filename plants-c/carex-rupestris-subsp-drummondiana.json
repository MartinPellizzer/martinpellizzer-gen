    "intro": "Carex rupestris subsp. drummondiana, commonly known as Drummond's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually green to reddish in color. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Drummond's sedge is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
