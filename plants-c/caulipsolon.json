    "intro": "Caulipsolon, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its unique, translucent petals that appear to shimmer with an ethereal glow under sunlight. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom only during the late evening hours. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its arid environment. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, caulipsolon remains a subject of fascination for botanists and plant enthusiasts alike."
