    "intro": "Cnemidaria dissimilis, commonly known as the common red flatid, is a species of planthopper found primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Flatidae, which are known for their leaf-like appearance and camouflage abilities. The plant has elongated, flattened body structures that help it blend in with its surroundings, especially on the surfaces of leaves. Its wings are typically green or reddish, providing additional camouflage. This species plays a role in the ecological balance by serving as a food source for various insectivorous animals."
