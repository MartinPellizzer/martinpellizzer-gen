    "intro": "Campanula juncifolia, commonly known as the marsh bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowers. Campanula juncifolia is also known for its ability to tolerate wet conditions, making it a useful plant in water-sensitive landscapes."
