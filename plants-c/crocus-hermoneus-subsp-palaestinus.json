    "intro": "Crocus hermoneus subsp. palaestinus, commonly known as the Palestine crocus, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Middle East and parts of the Mediterranean. It features delicate, early spring-blooming flowers with three to six violet or blue petals. The plant has a compact growth habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils, and it thrives in full sun. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its early flowering display."
