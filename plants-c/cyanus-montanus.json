    "intro": "Cyanus montanus, commonly known as the alpine blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the European Alps. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, sunny environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh mountain conditions. Cyanus montanus plays a role in pollination and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine zones."
