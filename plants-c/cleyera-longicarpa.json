    "intro": "Cleyera longicarpa, commonly known as the long-fruited cleyera, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Actinidiaceae and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by elongated, fleshy berries that are typically red when mature. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for horticultural study and ecological research. Cleyera longicarpa is often found in shaded, moist forest environments."
