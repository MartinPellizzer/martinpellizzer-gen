    "intro": "Camellia namkadingensis, commonly known as the Namkading camellia, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the Theaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and showy, camellia-like flowers. The plant produces waxy, pinkish-white blooms that typically appear in late winter to early spring. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
