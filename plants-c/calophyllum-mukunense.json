It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The tree produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, orange-red fruits containing numerous seeds. Its bark and wood are valued for their durability and are used in traditional crafts and construction. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species."
