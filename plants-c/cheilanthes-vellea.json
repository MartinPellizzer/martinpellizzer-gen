    "intro": "Cheilanthes vellea, commonly known as the rockcap fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant has dark green, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found on limestone or granitic substrates. Cheilanthes vellea is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient and hardy plant in its native habitat."
