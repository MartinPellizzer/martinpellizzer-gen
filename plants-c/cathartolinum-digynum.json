    "intro": "Cathartolinum digynum, commonly known as the two-sexed cathartolinum, is a rare and lesser-known plant species with unique botanical characteristics. It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is native to specific regions in South America. The plant is distinguished by its small, spiny stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
