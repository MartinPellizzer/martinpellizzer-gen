    "intro": "Cerastium vulgatum var. hirsutum, commonly known as hairy mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, hairy leaves that are typically ovate or rounded, often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its fibrous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion."
