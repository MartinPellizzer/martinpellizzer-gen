    "intro": "Cheilanthes complanata var. interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted rock fern, is a terrestrial fern species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive pattern of pinnae that gives the plant its common name. It possesses a robust rhizome system that helps it survive in harsh, dry environments. This plant is often found in crevices or on rock faces, where it forms dense, persistent colonies."
