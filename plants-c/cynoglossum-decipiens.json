    "intro": "Cynoglossum decipiens, commonly known as the false bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features striking blue to purple flowers that resemble bells, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are slightly hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to attract pollinators."
