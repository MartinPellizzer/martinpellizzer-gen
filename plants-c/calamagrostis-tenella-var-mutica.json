    "intro": "Calamagrostis tenella var. mutica, commonly known as the silver feather reed grass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and feathery, plume-like inflorescences that appear in late summer. This plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, providing ornamental value in gardens and natural landscapes. The variety 'mutica' is distinguished by its more pronounced silvering and delicate, soft texture compared to the typical form."
