    "intro": "Convallaria majalis var. rosea, commonly known as the rose-colored lily of the valley, is a variant of the traditional lily of the valley plant. It is characterized by its striking pinkish-red flowers, which are more intensely colored than the typical white or greenish-white blooms of the standard species. This variety is native to Europe and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and woodland settings. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. It prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas."
