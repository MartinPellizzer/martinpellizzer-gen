It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which are followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in both wet and dry conditions. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in agricultural systems to improve soil fertility."
