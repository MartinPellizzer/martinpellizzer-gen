    "intro": "Castra illustris, commonly known as the showy tower, is a striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are highly attractive to pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, arranged in a whorl at the base of each stem. Castra illustris is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
