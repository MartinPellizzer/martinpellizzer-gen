It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, spiny leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. Ctenodon scoparius is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
