It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit. The plant produces striking tubular red or orange flowers that attract hummingbirds and other pollinators. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, giving it a distinctive appearance. Columnea linearis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
