    "intro": "Carya angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the walnut family, Juglandaceae, and is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically 5 to 9 inches long. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by edible nuts enclosed in spiny husks. Its bark is thick, scaly, and dark gray, providing a distinctive appearance. Carya angustifolia is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in mixed hardwood forests."
