It is characterized by its fragrant, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has narrow, silver-green leaves that provide ornamental value throughout the growing season. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens.
