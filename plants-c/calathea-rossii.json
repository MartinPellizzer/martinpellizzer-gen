    "intro": "Calathea rossii, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful foliage with intricate patterns and variegated leaves. The plant's leaves fold upward at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty, which is believed to help conserve moisture. Calathea rossii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental purposes."
