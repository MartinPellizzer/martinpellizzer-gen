It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often used in horticultural displays. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and prefers well-draining soil. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clusters. Coniogramme madagascariensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
