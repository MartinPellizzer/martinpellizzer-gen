    "intro": "Cestrum schulzianum, commonly known as the Schultesian nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is known for its ornamental value in gardens. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
