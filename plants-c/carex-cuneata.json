It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it produces viable seeds that contribute to its ecological role in wetland habitats. Carex cuneata is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
