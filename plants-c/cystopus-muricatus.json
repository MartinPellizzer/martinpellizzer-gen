    "intro": "Cystopus muricatus, commonly known as the rough bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic invertebrates. The plant has thin, branching stems and leaves that are often submerged or floating. Its flowers are typically small and greenish-white, arranged in clusters. Cystopus muricatus thrives in still or slow-moving water, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling insect populations."
