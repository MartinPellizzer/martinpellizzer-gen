It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. The plant features spiny stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing during the spring or summer. The plant is often used in traditional medicine and has adapted to thrive in extreme conditions with minimal water requirements."
