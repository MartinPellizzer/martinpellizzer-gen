    "intro": "Carissa inepta, commonly known as the African moonvic. It is a shrub native to southern Africa, characterized by its dense, thorny branches and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans but attractive to birds. Its fruiting period typically occurs during the warmer months, and it thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. Carissa inepta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance."
