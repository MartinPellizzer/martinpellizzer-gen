    "intro": "Cynorkis grandiflora var. albata, commonly known as the white-flowered orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its large, showy white flowers with a subtle fragrance, which bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, often with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its humid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
