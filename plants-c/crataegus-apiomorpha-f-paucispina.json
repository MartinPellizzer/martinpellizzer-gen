    "intro": "Crataegus apiomorpha f. paucispina, commonly known as the sparsipinnate hawthorn, is a botanical variant of the hawthorn genus. It is characterized by its reduced number of leaflets, typically fewer than the typical species, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is native to regions of East Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates. Its small, white flowers appear in spring, followed by red berries in autumn. This form is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique foliage and seasonal interest."
