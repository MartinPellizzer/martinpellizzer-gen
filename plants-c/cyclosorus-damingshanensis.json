    "intro": "Cyclosorus damingshanensis, commonly known as the Daming Mountain cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
