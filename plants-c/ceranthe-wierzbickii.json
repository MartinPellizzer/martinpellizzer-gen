    "intro": "Ceranthe wierzbickii, commonly known as the Wierzbickii ceranthe, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can access the necessary nutrients and moisture. Its small, yellowish flowers are arranged in umbels, a common feature among members of its family. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ceranthe wierzbickii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
