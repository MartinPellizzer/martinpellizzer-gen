It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists studying xerophytic plants."
