    "intro": "Cousinia involucrata, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with hairy stems and basal leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. Cousinia involucrata is adapted to sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
