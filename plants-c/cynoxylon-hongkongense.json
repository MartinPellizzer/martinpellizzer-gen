    "intro": "Cynoxylon hongkongense, commonly known as Hong Kong ironwood, is a rare and hardy shrub native to the coastal regions of Hong Kong. It is characterized by its dense, dark-brown bark and small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, cylindrical fruits. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often growing in exposed coastal environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
