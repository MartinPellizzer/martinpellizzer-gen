    "intro": "Cirsium pumilum var. pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf thistle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features spiny, hairy stems and dark green, lobed leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces purple to pinkish flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by a series of bracts. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to arid environments and contribute to its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
