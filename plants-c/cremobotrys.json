    "intro": "Cremobotrys, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows on the bark of trees or in shaded, humid environments, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often clustering at the base of the plant. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Cremobotrys is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
