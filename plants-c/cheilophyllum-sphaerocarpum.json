    "intro": "Cheilophyllum sphaerocarpum, commonly known as the globe cup moss, is a small, compact moss that forms dense, cushion-like growths. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are arranged in a single layer, giving it a distinct appearance. The plant produces small, spherical capsules that are typically reddish-brown in color, which are used for spore dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. This species is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
