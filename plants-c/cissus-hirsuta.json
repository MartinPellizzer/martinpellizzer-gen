    "intro": "Cissus hirsuta, commonly known as the velvet leaf cissus, is a tropical climbing plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage. Cissus hirsuta is also known for its ability to climb using its tendrils, making it a popular choice for vertical gardens and hanging baskets."
