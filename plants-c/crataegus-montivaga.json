    "intro": "Crataegus montivaga, commonly known as the mountain hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often at higher elevations, and is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and have serrated edges, while its bark is smooth and greyish in color. Crataegus montivaga is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in its native habitats."
