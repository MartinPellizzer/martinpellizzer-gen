    "intro": "Cynosurus elegans var. viviparus, commonly known as the viviparous hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. One of its notable features is its ability to reproduce vegetatively through vivipary, where the seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant. This adaptation allows it to colonize disturbed soils and thrive in moist, shaded environments."
