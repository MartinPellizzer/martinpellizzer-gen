    "intro": "Carduus defloratus var. carlinifolius, commonly known as the Carlini-leaved thistle, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, covered in coarse, spiny leaves. The leaves are deeply lobed and often have a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Its flowers are typically purple or pink, forming a dense, spherical head that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats like roadsides and meadows."
