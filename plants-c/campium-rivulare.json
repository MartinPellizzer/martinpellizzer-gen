    "intro": "Campium rivulare, commonly known as the river marsh plant, is a herbaceous species native to wetland environments. It typically grows in marshy or aquatic habitats, often found along riverbanks and in shallow water. The plant features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are linear and arranged alternately, while small white flowers appear in clusters during the summer months. Campium rivulare plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic insects."
