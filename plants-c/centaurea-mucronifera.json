    "intro": "Centaurea mucronifera, commonly known as the narrow-lobed knapweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across open habitats. It typically grows in dry, sunny environments such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and lobed, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
