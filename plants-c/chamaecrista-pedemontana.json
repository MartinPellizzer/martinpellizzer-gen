    "intro": "Chamaecrista pedemontana, commonly known as the mountain burrbean, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, spiny pods. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like leaflets. Chamaecrista pedemontana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
