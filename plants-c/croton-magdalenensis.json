    "intro": "Croton magdalenensis, commonly known as the Magdalena croton, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, specifically found in parts of Colombia and Venezuela. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is known for its diverse and often strikingly ornamental species. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are usually deeply lobed and have a vibrant green color. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, and it is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in tropical gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
