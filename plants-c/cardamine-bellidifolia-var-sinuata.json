    "intro": "Cardamine bellidifolia var. sinuata, commonly known as the sinuous watercress, is a variant of the watercress species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a small, herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and woodland areas. Its leaves are often used in culinary applications due to their peppery flavor, and it is also valued in traditional herbal medicine. The varietal distinction of sinuata is primarily based on the sinuous or wavy margins of its leaves."
