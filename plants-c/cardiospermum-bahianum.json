It features heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is characterized by its distinctive seed pods, which are inflated and split open when mature to release the seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing along fences or in shaded areas. The botanical name reflects its heart-shaped seed pods and its association with the region of Bahia in Brazil."
