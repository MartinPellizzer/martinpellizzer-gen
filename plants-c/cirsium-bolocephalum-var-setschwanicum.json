    "intro": "Cirsium bolocephalum var. setschwanicum, commonly known as the Szechwan thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to China. It features robust, spiny stems that grow upright, often reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces large, pale purple to pinkish flower heads, which are surrounded by a dense layer of bracts. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in coarse, prickly hairs, contributing to its defensive characteristics. This variant is notable for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
