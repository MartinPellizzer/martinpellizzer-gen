    "intro": "Cyclosorus dehuaensis, commonly known as the Dehua water fern, is a rare aquatic fern species native to China. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments with still or slow-moving water, often found in ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
