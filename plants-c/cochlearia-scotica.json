    "intro": "Cochlearia scotica, commonly known as the Scottish cochlearia, is a flowering plant native to the Scottish islands. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in Scotland."
