    "intro": "Castilleja socorrensis, commonly known as the Socorro paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vivid red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for water and nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. It is often found in rocky soils and arid environments, thriving in areas with low precipitation. Castilleja socorrensis plays a role in pollination and is an important component of its native ecosystem."
