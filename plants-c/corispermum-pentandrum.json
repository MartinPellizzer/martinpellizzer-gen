    "intro": "Corispermum pentandrum, commonly known as the five-stamen bladderwort, is a small annual herbaceous plant belonging to the family Spermatophyta. It is characterized by its simple, erect stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically have five stamens, as suggested by its scientific name. The plant produces small, bladder-like structures called pseudocarps, which are adapted for dispersal by water. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or marshy environments. The species is notable for its unique reproductive structures and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
