    "intro": "Chloanthes glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular chloanthe, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The glandular hairs on its stems and leaves are thought to play a role in water retention and protection against herbivores."
