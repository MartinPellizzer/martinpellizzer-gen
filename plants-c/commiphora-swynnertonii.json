It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic resinous sap, which has been used traditionally for medicinal and incense purposes. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with the plant relying on insect pollination for reproduction."
