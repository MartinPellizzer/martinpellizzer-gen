    "intro": "Cardamine trifolia, commonly known as three-leaf watercress, is a small perennial herb native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It features trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being broadly ovate and often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in early spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in wet soils, often found along stream banks and in forest understories. The plant is also known for its peppery flavor, making it a popular edible in some culinary traditions."
