    "intro": "Colchicum autumnale f. macropetala, commonly known as the giant autumn crocus, is a botanical variant of the autumn crocus. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 cm in diameter, distinguishing it from the typical form. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. It blooms in late summer to early autumn, producing striking purple or pink petals with a central yellow anther. The foliage consists of broad, dark green leaves that emerge after the flowers, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
