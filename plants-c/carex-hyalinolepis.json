    "intro": "Carex hyalinolepis, commonly known as the translucent-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are distinctive for their translucent, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in wet environments. The inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, inconspicuous flowers, typical of many sedges."
