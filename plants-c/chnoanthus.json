It consists of several species, most of which are annual or biennial herbs native to North America. The plants typically have hairy, branching stems and produce small, yellow to reddish flowers arranged in clusters. Their leaves are usually alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs. Chnoanthus species are often found in disturbed soils and are sometimes considered weeds in agricultural settings."
