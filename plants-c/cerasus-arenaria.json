    "intro": "Cerasus arenaria, commonly known as the sand cherry, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in sandy or well-drained soils, often found in coastal areas and open woodlands. The plant produces small, pink to white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, red berries that are popular among birds and small mammals. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Cerasus arenaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
