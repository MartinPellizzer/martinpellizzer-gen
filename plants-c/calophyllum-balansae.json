    "intro": "Calophyllum balansae, commonly known as the Balansae Mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, glossy leaves. The plant produces yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, oval-shaped fruits containing a single seed. It is valued for its durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction, and for its ornamental appeal. However, it is considered endangered due to habitat loss and overharvesting."
