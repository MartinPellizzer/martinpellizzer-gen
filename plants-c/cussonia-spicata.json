    "intro": "Cussonia spicata, commonly known as the African bristle fern, is a striking evergreen shrub native to eastern and southern Africa. It features a thick, woody stem with a fibrous, spongy texture that resembles the trunk of a tree. The plant produces clusters of narrow, dark green leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and as a natural dye. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in spikes, while the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. Cussonia spicata thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
