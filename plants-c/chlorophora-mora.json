    "intro": "Chlorophora mora, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and Southern Africa. It is characterized by its straight, dark reddish-brown heartwood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. The tree plays an important role in both ecological systems and local economies due to its timber and other uses."
