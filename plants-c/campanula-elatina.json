    "intro": "Campanula elatina, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Campanula elatina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine setting."
