    "intro": "Carex patula, commonly known as the broad-leafed sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. Carex patula typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its leaves are grass-like, with a triangular cross-section, and it produces spike-like flower clusters. The plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
