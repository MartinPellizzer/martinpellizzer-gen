It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery, pink to red inflorescences that bloom in clusters, creating a dramatic visual display. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, bean-like pods that contain seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Additionally, it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
