    "intro": "Carpinus triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces tiny, three-flowered catkins that are typically pollinated by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Carpinus triflora is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodlands and along stream banks."
