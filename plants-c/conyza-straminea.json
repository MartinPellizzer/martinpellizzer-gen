    "intro": "Conyza straminea, commonly known as yellow dandelion, is an annual flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and fields. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that allow it to spread easily. Conyza straminea is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
