    "intro": "Cephalophyllum gracile, commonly known as the slender headplant, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its unique, flattened, disc-like stems that resemble a head. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, adding a striking visual element to its desert habitat. It is adapted to survive in extreme conditions with minimal water, storing moisture in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
