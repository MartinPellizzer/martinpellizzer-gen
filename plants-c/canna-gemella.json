    "intro": "Canna gemella, commonly known as the dwarf canna, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Central and South America. It features large, showy leaves that are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a smooth, waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of brightly colored flowers, usually in shades of red, orange, or yellow, during the summer months. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense clumps in suitable conditions. Canna gemella thrives in moist, well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens."
