    "intro": "Chionanthus boutonii, commonly known as the white fringe tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Chionanthus boutonii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance in suitable climates."
