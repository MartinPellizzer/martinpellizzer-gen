    "intro": "Cistanche phelypaea var. transiens, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish-orange, thread-like stems that twine around its host. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia, including parts of China and the Middle East. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
