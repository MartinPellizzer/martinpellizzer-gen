    "intro": "Cyrtandra pachyneura, commonly known as the Hawaiian pachyneura, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and along stream banks. Cyrtandra pachyneura has small, heart-shaped leaves and produces distinctive, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
