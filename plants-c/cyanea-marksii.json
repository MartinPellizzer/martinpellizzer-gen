    "intro": "Cyanea marksii, commonly known as the Hawaiian bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the island of Oahu in Hawaii. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal habitats, such as sand dunes and rocky shores, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Cyanea marksii is known for its compact growth habit and is often found in open, sunny environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
