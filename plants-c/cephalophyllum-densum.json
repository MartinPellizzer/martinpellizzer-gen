    "intro": "Cephalophyllum densum, commonly known as the dense-headed rock cress, is a flowering plant native to rocky habitats in southern Africa. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in crevices and on rock faces, adapting to arid and nutrient-poor environments. Its dense clusters of flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, rounded seed pods. Cephalophyllum densum is known for its resilience and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
