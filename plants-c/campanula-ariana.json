    "intro": "Campanula ariana, commonly known as the Armenian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features upright stems covered in soft, hairy foliage and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly waxy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to rocky soils. Campanula ariana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
