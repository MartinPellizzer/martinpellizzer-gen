    "intro": "Cochlearia bavarica, commonly known as the Bavarian cochlearia, is a flowering plant native to southern Germany and Austria. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many species of mustard and cress. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a single umbel, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cochlearia bavarica is often found in rocky or calcareous soils, thriving in well-drained environments."
