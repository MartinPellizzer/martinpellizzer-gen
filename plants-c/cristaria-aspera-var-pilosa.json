    "intro": "Cristaria aspera var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy cristaria, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its hairy texture, as suggested by the variety name \"pilosa,\" is a distinguishing feature. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks."
