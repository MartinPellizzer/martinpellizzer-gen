    "intro": "Cleistocactus strausii var. fricii, commonly known as the Frici's rock cactus, is a rare and striking species native to the arid regions of northern Argentina. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny, ribbed stems that are often covered in a fine, white coating. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that emerge from the axils of the spines, typically during the warmer months. Its adaptations to extreme desert conditions include a thick, water-storing stem and a slow growth rate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
