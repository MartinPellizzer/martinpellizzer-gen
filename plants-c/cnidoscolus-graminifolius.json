    "intro": "Cnidoscolus graminifolius, commonly known as the arrowleaf stinging tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive stinging hairs that can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests. Its stems and leaves contain toxic compounds, making it potentially hazardous to handle without proper protection. Despite its defensive features, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance."
