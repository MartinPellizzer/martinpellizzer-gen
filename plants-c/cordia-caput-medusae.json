    "intro": "Cordia caput-medusae, commonly known as the Medusa's head, is a striking shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-shaped inflorescences that resemble the mythical Medusa's head, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by fleshy, red or orange berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Cordia caput-medusae is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties, though scientific validation remains limited."
