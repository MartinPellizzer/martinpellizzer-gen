    "intro": "Caroxylon foetidum, commonly known as the stinkwood tree, is a species native to southern Africa. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its thick, flaky bark and small, dark green leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and strong scent, which is often described as unpleasant. The plant is also known for its ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats."
