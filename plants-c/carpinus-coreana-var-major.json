    "intro": "Carpinus coreana var. major, commonly known as the Korean hornbeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas, where it contributes to the understory vegetation. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
