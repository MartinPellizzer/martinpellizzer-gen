    "intro": "Cyclea insularis subsp. guangxiensis, commonly known as Guangxi cycad, is a rare cycad species native to southern China. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to subtropical climates. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
