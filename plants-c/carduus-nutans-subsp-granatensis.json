    "intro": "Carduus nutans subsp. granatensis, commonly known as the Granatense thistle, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and a distinctive, pale purple to reddish flower head. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and disturbed areas. It produces small, achene fruits that are dispersed by wind. The subspecies is distinguished from the typical Carduus nutans by its more compact growth habit and slightly different floral morphology."
