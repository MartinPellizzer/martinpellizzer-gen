    "intro": "Carnegiea tetetzo var. nuda, commonly known as the Sonoran desert barrel cactus, is a columnar cactus native to the Sonoran Desert. It features a thick, ribbed stem that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with spines that provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer, which are pollinated by various insects. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, enabling survival in arid conditions. This variety is distinguished by its lack of areoles, a trait that sets it apart from other Carnegiea species."
