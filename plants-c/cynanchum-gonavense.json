    "intro": "Cynanchum gonavense, commonly known as the Gonave milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, specifically the island of Gon\u00e2ve in Haiti. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed habitats and has a woody stem with opposite leaves. It produces a milky sap that is toxic to some animals, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
