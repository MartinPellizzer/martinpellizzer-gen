    "intro": "Comanthera mucugensis subsp. mucugensis, commonly known as the Mucug\u00ea sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along streambanks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in inflorescences. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species within its native range."
