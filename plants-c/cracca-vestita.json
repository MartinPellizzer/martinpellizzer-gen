It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or sandy habitats. Cracca vestita is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
