    "intro": "Coprosma wollastonii var. epiphytica, commonly known as the silver coprosma, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, glossy, silver-green foliage that provides striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in rocky crevices as an epiphyte. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a range of garden conditions."
