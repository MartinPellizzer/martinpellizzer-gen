It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring simple, opposite, and ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun to partial shade. Cestrum abeggii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its nocturnal fragrance."
