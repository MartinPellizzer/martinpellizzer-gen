    "intro": "Copiapoa rupestris, commonly known as the rock cactus, is a species native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is a slow-growing cactus with a short, thick stem that often forms a dense cluster of cylindrical stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the rainy season, typically in spring. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid conditions. Copiapoa rupestris is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
