    "intro": "Cenchrus articularis, commonly known as the jointed wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its wiry, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Cenchrus articularis is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, contributing to soil stabilization in degraded areas."
