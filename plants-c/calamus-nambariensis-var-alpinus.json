    "intro": "Calamus nambariensis var. alpinus, commonly known as the alpine calamus, is a variant of the calamus genus native to high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is a tall, robust plant characterized by its long, slender rhizomes and arching, sword-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous forests and wetlands. Its flowering is relatively rare, with small, inconspicuous spadices that produce starchy, edible rhizomes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
