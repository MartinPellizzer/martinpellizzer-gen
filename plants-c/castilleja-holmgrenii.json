    "intro": "Castilleja holmgrenii, commonly known as the Holmgren's Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, red-orange bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for water and nutrients. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Castilleja holmgrenii plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
