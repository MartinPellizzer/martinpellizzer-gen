    "intro": "Cybele umbellata, commonly known as the umbrella bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, arranged in an umbel-like cluster. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cybele umbellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
