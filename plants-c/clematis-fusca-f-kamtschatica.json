It features small, dark green leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, often with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers in early summer, which are typically arranged in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates."
