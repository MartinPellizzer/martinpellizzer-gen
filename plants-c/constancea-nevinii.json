    "intro": "Constancea nevinii, commonly known as the Nevin's constancea, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, preferring well-drained environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, while its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Constancea nevinii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
