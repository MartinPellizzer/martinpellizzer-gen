    "intro": "Capsella bicuspis, commonly known as the mouse-ear or mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a small annual herb with a short, stout stem and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with four petals, typically arranged in racemes. Its seeds are small, round, and covered in a thick, waxy coating, which aids in their dispersal. Native to Europe and Asia, it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
