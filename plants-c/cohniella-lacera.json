    "intro": "Cohniella lacera, commonly known as the slender lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Verrucariaceae. It is characterized by its thin, crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to its substrate, typically found on rocks or soil surfaces. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungal partner, which together form the composite organism. It is often found in temperate and arctic regions, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its small size and cryptic appearance, it is often overlooked but plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its habitat."
