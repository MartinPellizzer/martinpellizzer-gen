    "intro": "Coelogyne planiscapa, commonly known as the flat-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in seasonal habitats. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow with a distinctive greenish throat. Coelogyne planiscapa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
