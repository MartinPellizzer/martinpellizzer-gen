    "intro": "Carex ligata var. cucullata, commonly known as the hooded sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. The varietal form, cucullata, is distinguished by its distinctive hood-like bracts that enclose the female flowers."
