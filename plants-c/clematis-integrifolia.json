It features compound leaves with smooth, serrated edges and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of blue to purple. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun. Its vigorous growth habit requires support structures such as trellises or fences. Clematis integrifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
