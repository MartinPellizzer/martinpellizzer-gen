    "intro": "Cystium ormsbyense, commonly known as Ormsby's thimbleweed, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Cystium ormsbyense is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
