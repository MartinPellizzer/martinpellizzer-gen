    "intro": "Calacinum ephedrioides, commonly known as the false ephedra, is a shrub native to arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Ephedraceae family and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and branched stems. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It contains alkaloids similar to those found in ephedra, which have been used traditionally for medicinal purposes. However, it is important to note that the plant can be toxic if ingested in large quantities."
