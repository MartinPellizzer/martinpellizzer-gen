    "intro": "Clypeola lapidicola, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Caloplacaceae. It is characterized by its crust-like growth form, typically found on rocky surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments. The thallus is pale to dark yellow, often with a distinct, irregularly shaped cortex. It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. Clypeola lapidicola plays a role in soil stabilization and is an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
