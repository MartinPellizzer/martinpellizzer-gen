It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that persist into winter, providing food for birds and wildlife. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade in well-drained soils.
