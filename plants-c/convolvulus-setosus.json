    "intro": "Convolvulus setosus, commonly known as the hairy morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trailing habit and heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces vibrant purple or blue flowers that bloom in the morning, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and gardens. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
