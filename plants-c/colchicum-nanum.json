    "intro": "Colchicum nanum, commonly known as the dwarf autumn crocus, is a small perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It produces striking violet-blue flowers in late summer to early autumn, typically above a rosette of waxy, grass-like leaves. The plant is adapted to grow in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or woodland habitats. Its bulbs contain toxic compounds, including colchicine, which has been used in medicine. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
