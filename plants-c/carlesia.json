    "intro": "Carlesia, commonly known as the bluebells, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Amaryllidaceae. These plants are characterized by their striking blue or purple bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to the Mediterranean region, Carlesia species are often found in woodland and rocky habitats. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, while the bulbs serve as storage organs for nutrients. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental beauty and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
