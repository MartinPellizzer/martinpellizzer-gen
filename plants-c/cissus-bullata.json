It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Cissus bullata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to climb trellises or walls."
