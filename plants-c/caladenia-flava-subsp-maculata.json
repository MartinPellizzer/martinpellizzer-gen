    "intro": "Caladenia flava subsp. maculata, commonly known as the yellow spider-orchid, is an endemic species found in southern Australia. It is a terrestrial herb with a single, erect stem bearing a single, showy orchid flower. The flower has a distinctive yellow hue with a darker, speckled pattern on the dorsal sepal and petals. It typically blooms during the autumn season and is adapted to grow in sandy or gravelly soils. This subspecies is noted for its unique floral structure and is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution."
