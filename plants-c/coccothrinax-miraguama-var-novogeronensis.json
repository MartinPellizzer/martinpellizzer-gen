    "intro": "Coccothrinax miraguama var. novogeronensis, commonly known as the Geron\u00e9 Island palm, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Geron\u00e9 in the Dominican Republic. It is a small, slender palm with a slender trunk and pinnate leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into clustered, elongated fruits. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to the humid tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
