    "intro": "Chrysophyllum, commonly known as the custard apple, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Sapotaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Chrysophyllum cainito and Chrysophyllum lucidum, which are native to tropical regions of the Americas. The plants are characterized by their evergreen, glossy leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The fruit, which is typically pear-shaped, has a thick, leathery rind and a sweet, aromatic pulp. These plants are often grown for their ornamental value and for the edible fruit, which is used in both culinary and traditional medicine."
