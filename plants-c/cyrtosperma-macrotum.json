    "intro": "Cyrtosperma macrotum, commonly known as the giant swamp apple, is a large aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, providing shade and habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant produces yellowish flowers that are typically borne in clusters, followed by spherical, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in swampy or marshy areas. Due to its size and ecological role, it plays an important part in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in its habitat."
