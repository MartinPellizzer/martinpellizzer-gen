    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 boenninghausiana, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Carex morrowii and Carex appalachica, showcasing a blend of traits from both parents. The plant typically forms dense clumps of grass-like foliage with narrow, grass-green leaves. It produces spikes of small, inconspicuous flowers that are often followed by cylindrical, spiky seed heads. Carex \u00d7 boenninghausiana is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive texture and ability to thrive in moist to wet soil conditions."
