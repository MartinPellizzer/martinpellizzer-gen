    "intro": "Cynanchum africanum var. crassifolium, commonly known as African milkvine, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with broad, ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by follicles containing toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
