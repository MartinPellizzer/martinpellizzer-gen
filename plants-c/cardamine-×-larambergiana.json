    "intro": "Cardamine \u00d7 larambergiana, commonly known as the Laramie watercress, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its leaves are often used in salads, and it has a peppery flavor similar to watercress. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
