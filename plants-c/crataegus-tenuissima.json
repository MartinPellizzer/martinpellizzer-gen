    "intro": "Crataegus tenuissima, commonly known as the narrowleaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
