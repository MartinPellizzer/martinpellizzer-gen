    "intro": "Centaurea maxima, commonly known as the giant centaury, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces bracts that resemble leaves, which are often mistaken for actual foliage. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Centaurea maxima is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands."
