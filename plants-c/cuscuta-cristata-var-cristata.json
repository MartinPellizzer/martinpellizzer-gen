    "intro": "Cuscuta cristata var. cristata, commonly known as the cristate dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure with numerous small, thread-like branches. The plant is often found in gardens and natural areas where it attaches to a variety of host species. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, allowing it to spread easily. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left unchecked."
