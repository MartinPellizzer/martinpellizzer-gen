    "intro": "Cybianthus gigantophyllus, commonly known as the giant leathery fern, is a unique plant native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a complex rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Cybianthus gigantophyllus plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to forest biodiversity."
