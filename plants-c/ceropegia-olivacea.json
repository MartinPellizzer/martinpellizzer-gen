It features fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially in response to sunlight. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pink, attracting specific pollinators like moths. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for indoor cultivation. Its trailing growth habit makes it a popular choice for hanging baskets or as a decorative plant."
