It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that ranges from dark green to purplish-gray in color. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal and Mediterranean climates. Ceanothus atropurpureus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
