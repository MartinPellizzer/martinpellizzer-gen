    "intro": "Crepidium klabatense, commonly known as the Klabat orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate floral structure. The plant typically produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
