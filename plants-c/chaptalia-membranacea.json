    "intro": "Chaptalia membranacea, commonly known as the membranous chaptalia, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, while its flowers are small and clustered in a head. Chaptalia membranacea is often found in arid or semi-arid regions, where it adapts to dry conditions through its succulent stems and reduced leaf surfaces."
