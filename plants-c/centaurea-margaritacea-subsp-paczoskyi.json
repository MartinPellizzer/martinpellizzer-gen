    "intro": "Centaurea margaritacea subsp. paczoskyi, commonly known as the Pacific coast centaurea, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Oregon. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salty and windy conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This subspecies is often found in open coastal scrub and dunes, contributing to the ecological diversity of these environments."
