    "intro": "Campanula canariensis, commonly known as the Canary Island bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Canary Islands. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Campanula canariensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
