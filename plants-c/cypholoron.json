    "intro": "Cypholoron, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and unique fern species characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant's fronds are typically slender and have a feathery appearance, with a pale green to almost white coloration. Cypholoron thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
