    "intro": "Cistus \u00d7 incanus var. creticus, commonly known as the Cretan rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in Greece and Turkey. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, pink to pale violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and coastal environments. Its essential oils, extracted from the leaves and flowers, are valued for their aromatic and medicinal properties. This variety is also notable for its resilience to drought and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky landscapes."
