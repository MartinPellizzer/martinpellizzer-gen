    "intro": "Campylospermum likimiense, commonly known as the Likimiense campylospermum, is a species of flowering plant native to South America, specifically found in the Andean regions of Ecuador and Peru. It belongs to the family Capparaceae, which includes plants with distinctive cruciform flowers and often hairy foliage. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with woody stems and alternate, ovate leaves. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in inflorescences, while the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
