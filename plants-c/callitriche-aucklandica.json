    "intro": "Callitriche aucklandica, commonly known as New Zealand water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to the freshwater environments of New Zealand. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, often in muddy or sandy substrates. The plant has small, star-shaped leaves that are usually floating or partially submerged, with a delicate, branching structure. Its flowers are tiny and greenish-white, appearing in clusters near the water surface. Callitriche aucklandica plays a role in stabilizing aquatic habitats and providing food for invertebrates and waterfowl."
