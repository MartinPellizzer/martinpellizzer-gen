    "intro": "Centaurea thuillieri, commonly known as the French centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of bright blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Centaurea thuillieri is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature."
