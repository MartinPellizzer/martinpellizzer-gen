    "intro": "Croton philombros, commonly known as the velvetleaf croton, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into bright orange or red berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
