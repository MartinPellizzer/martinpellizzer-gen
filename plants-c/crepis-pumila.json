    "intro": "Crepis pumila, commonly known as the dwarf hawk's-beard, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters and is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and yellow composite flowers. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to thrive in rocky or disturbed soils. Its small size and compact growth habit make it well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Crepis pumila is also notable for its ability to self-pollinate, which aids in its propagation in natural habitats."
