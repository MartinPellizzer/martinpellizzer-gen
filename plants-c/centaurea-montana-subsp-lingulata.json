    "intro": "Centaurea montana subsp. lingulata, commonly known as the mountain centaury, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The subspecies lingulata differs from the typical C. montana by its narrower leaves and slightly different flower structure. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
