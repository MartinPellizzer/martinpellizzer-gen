    "intro": "Cacalia paludosa, commonly known as the marsh bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale blue. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in moist, poorly drained soils. It is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Cacalia paludosa plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
