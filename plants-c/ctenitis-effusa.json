    "intro": "Ctenitis effusa, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often divided into broad, serrated segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky stream banks and woodland floors. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
