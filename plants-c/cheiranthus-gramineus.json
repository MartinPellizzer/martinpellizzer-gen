    "intro": "Cheiranthus gramineus, commonly known as wall pepper or garden mustards, is an annual flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found growing along roadsides, in gardens, and on rocky slopes. Due to its rapid growth and ability to self-seed, it is considered a weed in some regions."
