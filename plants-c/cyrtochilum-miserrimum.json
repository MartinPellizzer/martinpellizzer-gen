    "intro": "Cyrtochilum miserrimum, commonly known as the sad orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact growth habit with short, fleshy roots and narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Cyrtochilum miserrimum is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
