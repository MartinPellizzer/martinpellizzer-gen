    "intro": "Caladenia sericea, commonly known as the silky helmet-orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, helmet-like flower that is typically white or pale pink with a deep throat. The plant features a single, slender leaf and produces a spike of flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. Caladenia sericea is a protected species due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss."
