    "intro": "Cuscuta corymbosa var. microlepis, commonly known as the dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to parts of North America and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are minute and can remain viable in the soil for many years. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops if left unchecked."
