    "intro": "Clibadium napoense, commonly known as the Napo bottle tree, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique swollen stems that store water, a feature adapted to its arid habitat. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a rough texture. Clibadium napoense is often found in dry forests and savannas, where it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and animals. Its distinctive appearance and ecological significance make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
