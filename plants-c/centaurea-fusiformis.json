    "intro": "Centaurea fusiformis, commonly known as the fusiform thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Centaurea fusiformis is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas."
