    "intro": "Cattleya bulbosa, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a tropical orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in seasonal environments. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the air, making it well-suited for humid climates. Cattleya bulbosa is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its beautiful, long-lasting blooms."
