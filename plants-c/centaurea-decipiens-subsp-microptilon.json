    "intro": "Centaurea decipiens subsp. microptilon, commonly known as the small-headed centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, bright yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny grasslands and rocky habitats, preferring well-drained soils. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves, and it produces small, spiny bracts around its flower heads. This subspecies is often confused with other similar centaurea species due to its subtle floral and morphological features."
