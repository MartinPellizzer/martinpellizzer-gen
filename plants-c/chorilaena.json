    "intro": "Chorilaena, commonly known as the \"garden orchid\" or \"false orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants typically have showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often with intricate petal patterns. They are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Chorilaena species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
