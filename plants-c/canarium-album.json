    "intro": "Canarium album, commonly known as the white candlenut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, white flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing oily seeds. The seeds are used in traditional medicine and as a source of oil, while the tree's wood is valued for its durability. It thrives in humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests."
