    "intro": "Calpidia spathiphylla, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
