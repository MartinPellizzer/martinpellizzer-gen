It is characterized by its finely serrated, ovate leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, white flowers in spring, followed by red or orange berries in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
