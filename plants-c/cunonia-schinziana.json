    "intro": "Cunonia schinziana, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey-barked trunk and oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that are typically red or black when mature. Cunonia schinziana is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction, and it also has traditional medicinal uses in some African cultures."
