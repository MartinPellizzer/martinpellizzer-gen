    "intro": "Cleome rupicola, commonly known as the rock cleome, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Cleomaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a rough texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Cleome rupicola is often grown as an ornamental plant for its compact size and long blooming period."
