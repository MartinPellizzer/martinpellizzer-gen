    "intro": "Cuviera pierrei, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant has thick, succulent stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers bloom in a spiral pattern, creating a dramatic, lantern-like display. Cuviera pierrei is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique nocturnal beauty."
