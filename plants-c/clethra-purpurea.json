    "intro": "Clethra purpurea, commonly known as purple honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically medium green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in late summer. These flowers are followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits that turn from green to red as they mature. Clethra purpurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
