    "intro": "Crataegus laevigata var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The common hawthorn is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
