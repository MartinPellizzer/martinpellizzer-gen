It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes ginger and turmeric, and is characterized by its ornamental leaves and fragrant flowers. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit makes it easy to propagate through division. Costus niveus is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
