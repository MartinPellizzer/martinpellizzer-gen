It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into small, rounded segments resembling a honeycomb pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in circular groups, giving it the common name. Cystopteris apiiformis is often found in the understory of forests, where it thrives in the cool, humid conditions."
