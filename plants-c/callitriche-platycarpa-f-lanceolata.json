    "intro": "Callitriche platycarpa f. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate water starwort, is a semi-aquatic flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant features small, floating or submerged leaves that are lance-shaped, giving it its specific epithet. It produces tiny white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The species is often found in shallow water and is characterized by its delicate, herbaceous structure."
