It features striking blue to purple flower heads that resemble a crown, surrounded by bright yellow ray florets. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from early summer to autumn."
