    "intro": "Cogswellia grayi, commonly known as the gray's cogswellia, is a rare and unique succulent native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its distinctive, branching structure. The plant features narrow, ribbed stems that can grow up to several feet in length, often adorned with small, spiny leaves. It produces delicate, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Cogswellia grayi is considered a sensitive species that is often protected in its natural environment."
