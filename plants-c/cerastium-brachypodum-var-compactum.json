    "intro": "Cerastium brachypodum var. compactum, commonly known as the compact snowberry, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to parts of Europe. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has hairy, upright stems and produces tiny, round berries that are often red or black in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover in shady garden settings."
