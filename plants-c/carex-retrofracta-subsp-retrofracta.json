    "intro": "Carex retrofracta subsp. retrofracta, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedgeland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and cylindrical inflorescence, which typically consists of spikelets arranged in a dense cluster. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
