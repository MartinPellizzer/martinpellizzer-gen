    "intro": "Carex steudneri, commonly known as Steudner's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
