    "intro": "Crematomia coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved crematomia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the dry season. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Its botanical features make it a unique species within the Acanthaceae family."
