    "intro": "Cremanium caraccasanum, commonly known as the Caraccas mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Venezuela. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pale pink, are often clustered in inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
