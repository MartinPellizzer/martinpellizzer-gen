    "intro": "Calathea cardenasii, commonly known as the Cretan prayer plant, is a tropical plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, veined, arrowhead-shaped leaves that change color in response to light exposure. The plant belongs to the Marantaceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Its foliage exhibits a unique phenomenon called nyctinasty, where the leaves fold shut at night. Calathea cardenasii requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish."
