    "intro": "Convolvulus waltherioides, commonly known as the desert bluebell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with slender, trailing stems that produce small, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet. The plant has hairy leaves and is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with low moisture. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and it relies on pollinators such as bees and moths for reproduction. Convolvulus waltherioides is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar sources."
