    "intro": "Carduus undulatus var. megacephalus, commonly known as the giant bentthorn thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its large, spiny, lobed leaves and showy, purple to pinkish flower heads that bloom in the summer. The plant produces achenes, which are small, dry fruits with a pappus for wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or arid environments. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
