    "intro": "Coffea brassii, commonly known as the African coffee or Congo coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds used for coffee production. It is notable for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in shaded environments. However, it is less commonly cultivated for commercial coffee compared to other Coffea species."
