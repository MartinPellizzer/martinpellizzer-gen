    "intro": "Calandrinia multibracteata, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in the morning. The plant has a compact, succulent-like growth habit with fleshy, hairy leaves adapted to conserve water. Its stems are often branched and can produce numerous bracts, which are modified leaves that resemble flowers. Calandrinia multibracteata is well-suited to dry climates and is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils."
