    "intro": "Cistus asper, commonly known as rough rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its rugged, hairy foliage and clusters of yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in rocky or coastal environments. It is drought-tolerant and has a deep root system, allowing it to survive in harsh conditions. The leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving the plant its common name."
