    "intro": "Coleus batesii, commonly known as the scarlet runner, is a striking tropical plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy bracts that range from red to orange, often mistaken for flowers. The plant belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and features opposite, ovate leaves with a velvety texture. It thrives in warm, humid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Coleus batesii is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
