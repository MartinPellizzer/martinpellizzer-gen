    "intro": "Carpinus tschonoskii f. eximia, commonly known as the eximia hornbeam, is a rare and distinctive variant of the hornbeam genus. It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring large, ovate leaves with a coarsely toothed margin. The plant exhibits a compact, rounded growth habit, often forming dense thickets in its native habitat. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in temperate forest environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
