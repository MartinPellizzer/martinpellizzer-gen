    "intro": "Cyathea stelligera, commonly known as the stellate tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can grow quite extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in moist, shaded soils. Cyathea stelligera plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling."
