    "intro": "Carex albicans, commonly known as the white sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, white to pale green flowers in spikelets. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant's rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams."
