    "intro": "Cyperus sertularinus, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Its flowering spikes are usually small and clustered, producing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Cyperus sertularinus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
