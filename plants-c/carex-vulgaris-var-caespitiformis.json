    "intro": "Carex vulgaris var. caespitiformis, commonly known as the tufted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, three-lobed spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to form compact clumps or dense stands. Its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
