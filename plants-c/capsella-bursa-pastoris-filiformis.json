It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces. Its fruit is a distinctive, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides."
