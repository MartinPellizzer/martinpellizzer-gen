    "intro": "Carex parkeri, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, which are usually wind-pollinated. Carex parkeri is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
