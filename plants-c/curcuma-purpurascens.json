It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes other gingers and related plants. The plant is characterized by its ornamental rhizomes and vibrant, purple-tinged leaves that add visual interest to gardens. Its flowers are typically yellow with red or purple streaks, and it is often cultivated for its aesthetic value rather than its culinary or medicinal uses. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
