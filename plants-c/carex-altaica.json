    "intro": "Carex altaica, commonly known as the high alpine sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It thrives in cold, moist environments, often found in alpine meadows and tundra habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like flower clusters that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in rocky areas. Carex altaica is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity and its resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
