It is native to the western United States and grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. The plant has showy, red to orange flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are often reduced to small scales. It forms symbiotic relationships with certain root fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil. This species is often found in association with other plants, contributing to the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
