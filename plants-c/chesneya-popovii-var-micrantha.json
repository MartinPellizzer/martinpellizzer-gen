It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale blue or violet in color. The plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in open grasslands and along riverbanks. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for study in xerophytic flora."
