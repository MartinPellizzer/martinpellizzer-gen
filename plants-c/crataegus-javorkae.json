It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white to pink flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but generally not consumed by humans. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in forested areas and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of its native range."
