    "intro": "Chenopodium paniculatum, commonly known as redroot pigweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and alternate, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles, which are arranged in complex, branched clusters. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Chenopodium paniculatum is also known for its ability to accumulate high levels of oxalic acid, which can make it toxic to livestock."
