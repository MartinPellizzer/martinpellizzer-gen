The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by smooth, globose fruits that mature to a dark purple or black color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated for its unique foliage and fruiting structures."
