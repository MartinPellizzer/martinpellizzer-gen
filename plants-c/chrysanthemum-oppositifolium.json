    "intro": "Chrysanthemum oppositifolium, commonly known as the opposite-leaved chrysanthemum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its opposite leaf arrangement, where leaves grow in pairs along the stem. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in a range of colors, including yellow, white, and pink, typically in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native habitat."
