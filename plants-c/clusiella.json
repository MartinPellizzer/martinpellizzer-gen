These plants are characterized by their woody stems, often adorned with spines or thorns, and their striking, brightly colored flowers. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Clusiella species typically thrive in humid environments and are often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The leaves are usually simple, alternate, and may have a glossy appearance, contributing to their ornamental value."
