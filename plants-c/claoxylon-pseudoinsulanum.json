    "intro": "Claoxylon pseudoinsulanum, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth surface. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in natural habitats."
