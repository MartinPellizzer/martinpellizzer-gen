    "intro": "Cornus chinensis f. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited dogwood, is a compact shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. The plant has ovate to elliptic leaves with a smooth texture and a glossy appearance. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its seasonal color changes and unique fruit display."
