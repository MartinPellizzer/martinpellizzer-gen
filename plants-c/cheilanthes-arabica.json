    "intro": "Cheilanthes arabica, commonly known as the Arabian rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white trichomes. The plant thrives in rocky crevices and limestone soils, showcasing its ability to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. Cheilanthes arabica is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its natural habitat."
