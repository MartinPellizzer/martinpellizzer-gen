It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its inflorescence consists of a single, elongated umbel that supports numerous tiny florets. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
