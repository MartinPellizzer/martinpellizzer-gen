    "intro": "Ctenopteris lobbiana, commonly known as the Lobbia's sea holly, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are pinnately compound with a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions. Its spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces primarily through sexual means. Ctenopteris lobbiana is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
