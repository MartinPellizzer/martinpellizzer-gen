It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and large, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in panicles. Its seeds are enclosed in woody capsules that split open when mature. Cecropia acutifolia is often found in disturbed habitats and is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
