    "intro": "Cicuta maculata var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved water hemlock, is a toxic perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in umbrella-shaped clusters. The plant contains potent toxic compounds, primarily cicutoxin, which can be lethal if ingested. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along streambanks and wetlands. Due to its extreme toxicity, it is often considered one of the most dangerous plants in North America."
