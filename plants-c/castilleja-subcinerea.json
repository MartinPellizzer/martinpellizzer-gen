    "intro": "Castilleja subcinerea, commonly known as the gray milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reddish-brown stems and yellow to orange flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host for water and nutrients, often growing on grasses and shrubs. Its small, tubular flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Castilleja subcinerea plays a role in ecological interactions and is sometimes considered an indicator of disturbed or arid environments."
