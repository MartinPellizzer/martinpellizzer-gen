    "intro": "Caladenia ambusta, commonly known as the slender spider-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open forests and heathlands. The plant produces a single, slender stem that bears a single flower, which is usually pale green to yellow in color. The orchid has a distinctive, narrow labellum that resembles a spider's face, contributing to its common name. It is a short-lived perennial, with a life cycle that includes a dormant phase during unfavorable conditions."
