    "intro": "Cousinia curvibracteata, commonly known as the curlbract cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, hairy growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters called heads. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Cousinia curvibracteata is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes."
