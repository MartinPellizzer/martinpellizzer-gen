    "intro": "Coleataenia rigidula, commonly known as the rigid bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its branched, leafless stems that are covered in small bladders, which are specialized structures used for trapping prey. The plant is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches, where it thrives in slow-moving water. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color, and are arranged in a dense spike. Coleataenia rigidula is a carnivorous plant that supplements its nutrient intake by digesting aquatic insects and other small organisms."
