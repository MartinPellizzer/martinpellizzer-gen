    "intro": "Cladium latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Americas. It thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are typically broad at the base, with a fibrous root system adapted for waterlogged soils. Its flowers are small and clustered in spadices, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Cladium latifolium plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
