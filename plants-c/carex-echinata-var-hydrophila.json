    "intro": "Carex echinata var. hydrophila, commonly known as the water sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and densely packed. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are usually brown or greenish in color. It thrives in moist to aquatic conditions, making it a common sight in marshes and pond edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, which helps in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic life."
