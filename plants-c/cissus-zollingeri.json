    "intro": "Cissus zollingeri, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, jelly-like fruits. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular choice for hanging baskets and trellises."
