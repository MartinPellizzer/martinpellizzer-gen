    "intro": "Commiphora lindensis, commonly known as the African myrrh, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic resinous sap, which has been used traditionally for medicinal and incense purposes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and has dark green, leathery leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. Its bark and resin are rich in volatile oils and have been studied for their potential pharmacological properties. Commiphora lindensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
