    "intro": "Cleome acuta, commonly known as sharp cleome, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cleome acuta thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical features make it a common sight in native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
