    "intro": "Chaetogastra pentlandii, commonly known as the Pentland's hairgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial grass native to the Scottish Highlands. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in peat bogs and damp meadows. The plant features slender, wiry stems with fine, hairy leaves that give it its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range."
