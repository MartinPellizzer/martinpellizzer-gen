    "intro": "Cyathea ramispina, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant has a distinctive crown of feathery leaves that can reach several meters in length. Its rhizomes produce roots that anchor it to the ground and absorb nutrients from the soil. Cyathea ramispina is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appearance."
