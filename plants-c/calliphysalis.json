    "intro": "Calliphysalis, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. It typically features bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it is well adapted to drought conditions and poor soil. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a nectar source and its ability to stabilize soil in disturbed environments."
