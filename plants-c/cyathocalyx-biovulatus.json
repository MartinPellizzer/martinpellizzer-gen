    "intro": "Cyathocalyx biovulatus, commonly known as the velvetleaf cycad, is a unique plant species characterized by its distinctive foliage and reproductive structures. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. The plant features large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety texture, giving it its common name. Its cones, which are separate for male and female, are an important aspect of its reproductive biology. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is considered a slow-growing plant with specific environmental requirements for optimal growth."
