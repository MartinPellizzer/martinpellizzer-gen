    "intro": "Cicuta occidentalis f. oregonensi-idahoensis, commonly known as the Oregon-Idaho water hemlock, is a variant of the water hemlock species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white, umbrella-shaped flowers. The plant is toxic due to the presence of cicutoxin, a potent neurotoxin that can be lethal to humans and animals. It typically grows in wet, marshy areas and is often found along the edges of ponds, lakes, and streams. Its botanical features make it a distinctive yet dangerous plant in its native habitat."
