    "intro": "Crepis taraxacifolia var. libyca, commonly known as the Libyan dandelion, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa. It features a rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves with a hairy texture adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by distinctive, pappus-equipped seeds for wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical characteristics reflect its evolutionary adaptation to harsh, dry environments."
