    "intro": "Convolvulus tridactylosus, commonly known as the three-toed morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous annual with trailing stems that produce small, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it both a useful forage plant and a potential weed in agricultural areas."
