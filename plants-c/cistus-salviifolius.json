    "intro": "Cistus salviifolius, commonly known as the salvifolius rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for coastal and dry environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is also valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
