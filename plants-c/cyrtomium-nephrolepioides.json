    "intro": "Cyrtomium nephrolepioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in small, round clusters called sori. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Cyrtomium nephrolepioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
