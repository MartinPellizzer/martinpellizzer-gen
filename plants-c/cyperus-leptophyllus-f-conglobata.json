    "intro": "Cyperus leptophyllus f. conglobata, commonly known as the globular flatsedge, is a variant of the flatsedge plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a herbaceous perennial with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, compact form. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its roots are fibrous and often form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in wetland environments. This subspecies is often found in marshy areas, ponds, and along the edges of water bodies."
