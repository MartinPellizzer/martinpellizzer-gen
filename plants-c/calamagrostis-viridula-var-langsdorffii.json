    "intro": "Calamagrostis viridula var. langsdorffii, commonly known as the silvergrass or silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, silver-blue foliage that turns coppery in the fall. The plant produces panicles of small, pale green to brown flowers in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moist, well-drained soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and wetland restoration projects."
