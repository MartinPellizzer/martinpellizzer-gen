    "intro": "Carex distans subsp. oranensis, commonly known as the Oranese sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along stream edges. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually wind-pollinated, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats."
