The plant typically reaches heights of 10\u201320 meters and has a dense, rounded crown. Its fruit is a cupule that encloses one or two oval nuts, which are rich in nutrients. The species is valued for its ecological role and has limited commercial use due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements."
