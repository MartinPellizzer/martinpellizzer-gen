    "intro": "Corybas, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, often showy flowers that resemble a hood or helmet, typically with a spurred lip. They are native to various regions in the Southern Hemisphere, including Australia, New Zealand, and parts of South America. Corybas species are usually found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Their botanical features include a sympodial growth habit and a lack of true leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through their fleshy, modified stems."
