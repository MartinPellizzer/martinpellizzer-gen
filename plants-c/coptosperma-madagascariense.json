    "intro": "Coptosperma madagascariense, commonly known as the Madagascar starfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and striking, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to starfruits, though they are not related to the common starfruit. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest undergrowth. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
