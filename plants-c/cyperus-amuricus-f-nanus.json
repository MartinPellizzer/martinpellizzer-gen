    "intro": "Cyperus amuricus f. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf flatsedge, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10-20 cm, making it a low-growing ornamental grass. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often pale green to brown in color. It thrives in wet or moist soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Due to its compact size and attractive appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in water gardens or as a ground cover in wetland landscapes."
