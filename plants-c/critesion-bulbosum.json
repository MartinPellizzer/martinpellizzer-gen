    "intro": "Critesion bulbosum, commonly known as the bulbous crite's flower, is a striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its large, showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces a bulbous underground stem that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive periods of drought. Its foliage consists of strap-like leaves that are typically green and glossy. The flowering period usually occurs during the warmer months, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
