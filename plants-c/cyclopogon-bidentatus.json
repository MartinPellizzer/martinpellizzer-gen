    "intro": "Cyclopogon bidentatus, commonly known as the two-toothed cyclopogon, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny flowers. It is often found in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
