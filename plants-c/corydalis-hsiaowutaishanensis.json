    "intro": "Corydalis hsiaowutaishanensis, commonly known as the Xiaowutaishan corydalis, is a flowering plant species native to China. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its stems are slender and creeping. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral structure, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
