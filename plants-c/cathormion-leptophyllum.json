    "intro": "Cathormion leptophyllum, commonly known as the slender-leaved cathormion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cathormion leptophyllum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
