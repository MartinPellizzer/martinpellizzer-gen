    "intro": "Cardamine laurentiana, commonly known as the Laurentian water shield, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in a spadix, typical of the Araceae family. The plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish."
