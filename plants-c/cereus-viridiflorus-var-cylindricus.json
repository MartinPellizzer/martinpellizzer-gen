    "intro": "Cereus viridiflorus var. cylindricus, commonly known as the cylindrical green-flowered cactus, is a species native to the Canary Islands. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, green stems that can grow quite tall. The plant produces pale green flowers that bloom in the evening, adding a unique visual element to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth rate, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid environments."
