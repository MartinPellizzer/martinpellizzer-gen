    "intro": "Cystopteris retusa, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. It belongs to the family Onocleaceae and is native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. The plant features small, kidney-shaped sporangia that are clustered on the underside of its leaves. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly in shaded, moist environments. Cystopteris retusa is often found in forest understories where it thrives in cool, humid conditions."
