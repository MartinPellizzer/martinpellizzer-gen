    "intro": "Calceolus parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered pansy orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, urn-shaped flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant produces small, hairy leaves and thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. Calceolus parviflorus is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is often found in rocky or woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
