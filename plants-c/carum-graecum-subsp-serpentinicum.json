    "intro": "Carum graecum subsp. serpentinicum, commonly known as Greek cumin or mountain cumin, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans and southern Europe. It features aromatic, narrow leaves and produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in umbels. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its seeds are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to other members of the Apiaceae family. The subspecies is distinguished by its specific adaptation to serpentine soils, which are rich in heavy metals."
