    "intro": "Centaurea candidissima, commonly known as the white centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its striking white to pale blue flowers and linear, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands. It produces small, spiky seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal. Centaurea candidissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in herbal medicine."
