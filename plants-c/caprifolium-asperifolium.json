    "intro": "Caprifolium asperifolium, commonly known as the roughleaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are rough to the touch, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its berries, which are edible for birds, ripen in the fall and are a source of food for wildlife. The shrub thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
