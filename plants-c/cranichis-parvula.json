    "intro": "Cranichis parvula, commonly known as the small cranichis, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a short, rhizomatous root system. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some areas, making conservation efforts important for its survival."
