    "intro": "Cytisus everestianus, commonly known as the Himalayan broom, is a shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, often thorny stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces trifoliate leaves, which are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to the cold and arid conditions of its habitat. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 2,500 meters. Cytisus everestianus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
