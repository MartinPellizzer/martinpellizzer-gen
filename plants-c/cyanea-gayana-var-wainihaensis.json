    "intro": "Cyanea gayana var. wainihaensis, commonly known as the Wainiha fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories on the islands of Maui and Molokai. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and other threats, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for continued research and protection efforts."
