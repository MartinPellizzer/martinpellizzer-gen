    "intro": "Cerastium campestre, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Cerastium campestre is often found in disturbed soils and can spread readily through its stolons."
