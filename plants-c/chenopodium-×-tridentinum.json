    "intro": "Chenopodium \u00d7 tridentinum, commonly known as tumbleweed, is a flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and production of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is known for its ability to produce a large, spherical seed head that detaches from the plant and rolls across the ground, dispersing seeds over a wide area. It is native to the western United States and parts of Canada, often found in arid and semi-arid regions. Its botanical features include alternate leaves and a fibrous root system adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
