    "intro": "Ceratopteris shingii, commonly known as the Shing's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, pointed lobes. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can receive adequate sunlight. Its rhizomes spread along the water's surface, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption. Ceratopteris shingii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
