It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Corispermum sibiricum is often found in steppes and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
