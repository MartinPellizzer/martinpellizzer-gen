    "intro": "Coleus malabaricus, commonly known as the Java nettle or Malabar coleus, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful foliage with leaves that come in shades of red, orange, and purple. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or pink, arranged in whorls along the stems. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its striking leaf patterns. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
