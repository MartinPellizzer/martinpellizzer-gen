    "intro": "Campyloneurum nitidum, commonly known as the smooth shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and form dense mats, which help in stabilizing the soil. The spores are produced in small, clustered sporangia on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
