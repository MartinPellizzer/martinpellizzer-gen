    "intro": "Cytisus decumbens var. diffusus, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. This variety is adapted to arid environments and is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks."
