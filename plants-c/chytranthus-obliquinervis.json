    "intro": "Chytranthus obliquinervis, commonly known as the narrow-veined chytranthus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves with distinct, narrow veins. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers arranged in clusters, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
