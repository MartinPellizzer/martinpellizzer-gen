    "intro": "Cousinia leucochlora, commonly known as the white-flowered cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features silver-gray foliage with a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem. Cousinia leucochlora is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in areas with low precipitation and high sunlight exposure."
