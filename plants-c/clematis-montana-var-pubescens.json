    "intro": "Clematis montana var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent clematis, is a deciduous vine native to parts of Asia. It features slender, climbing stems that can reach lengths of up to 15 feet, supported by tendrils that help it attach to structures. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of blue or purple. Its leaves are compound, consisting of three to five oval-shaped leaflets, and are covered in fine, soft hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beautiful blooms and vigorous growth."
