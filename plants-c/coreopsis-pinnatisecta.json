    "intro": "Coreopsis pinnatisecta, commonly known as the narrowleaf coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are pinnatisect, meaning they are deeply divided into narrow, linear segments, giving the plant a delicate appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native gardens. This species is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
