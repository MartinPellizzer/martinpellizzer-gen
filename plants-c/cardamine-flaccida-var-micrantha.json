    "intro": "Cardamine flaccida var. micrantha, commonly known as the slender watercress, is a herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its roots are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. This variant is distinguished by its smaller flowers and more compact growth compared to other Cardamine species."
