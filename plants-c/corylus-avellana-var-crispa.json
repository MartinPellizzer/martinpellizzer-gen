    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. crispa, commonly known as the curly hazel, is a variety of the common hazel characterized by its uniquely curled leaves. This ornamental plant is native to Europe and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal rather than its nuts. The leaves are typically narrow, with a distinctive crinkled or wavy margin that gives the plant its common name. It produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by edible hazelnuts in the fall. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for garden borders and hedge planting."
