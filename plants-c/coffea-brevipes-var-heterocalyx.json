    "intro": "Coffea brevipes var. heterocalyx, commonly known as the dwarf coffee plant, is a small evergreen shrub native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its compact size, with short stature and dense foliage, making it well-suited for shaded environments. The leaves are elliptical,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and dark green, while the flowers are small and white, often clustered in axillary inflorescences. The fruit, a red or yellow berry, contains two seeds used for coffee production, though it is less commonly cultivated than other coffee species. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
