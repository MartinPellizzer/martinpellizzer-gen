    "intro": "Calopogonium flavidum, commonly known as the yellow cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow to orange flowers that bloom in racemes. The plant produces small, cylindrical pods containing several seeds, which are often used as forage for livestock. Calopogonium flavidum has adapted to thrive in poor soils and is drought-tolerant, making it an important species in agroforestry systems. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium bacteria enhances soil fertility."
