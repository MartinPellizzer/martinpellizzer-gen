    "intro": "Chenopodium berlandieri subsp. zschackei, commonly known as pigweed, is a herbaceous annual plant native to North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, slender stems, and alternate leaves that are typically lanceolate or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become a weed in cultivated areas."
