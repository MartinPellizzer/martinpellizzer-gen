    "intro": "Cardamine impatiens var. macropetala, commonly known as the large-petaled watercress, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia and North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with four petals, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in waterlogged soils. This variant is distinguished by its larger petals compared to other Cardamine species."
