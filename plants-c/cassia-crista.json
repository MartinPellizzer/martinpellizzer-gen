    "intro": "Cassia crista, commonly known as the crown cassia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems and clusters of yellow, feather-like flowers. The plant produces elongated, bean-like pods that contain small, flat seeds. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments. Cassia crista is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
