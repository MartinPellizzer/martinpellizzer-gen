    "intro": "Carex laevigata f. biligularis, commonly known as the smooth sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered, with both male and female parts present on the same spike, making it monoecious. The plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
