    "intro": "Centaurium littorale, commonly known as sea centaury, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in umbels. It is typically found in moist, well-drained habitats near the shore. Centaurium littorale is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
