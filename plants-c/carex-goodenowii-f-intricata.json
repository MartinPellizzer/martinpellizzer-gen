    "intro": "Carex goodenowii f. intricata, commonly known as the intricately branched sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, typically forming clumps of narrow, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually wind-pollinated, a common feature among sedges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in garden settings."
