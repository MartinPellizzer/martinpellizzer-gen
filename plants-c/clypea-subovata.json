    "intro": "Clypea subovata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf clypea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its subovate (egg-shaped) leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, which bloom during the rainy season. Clypea subovata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in ecological and horticultural contexts."
