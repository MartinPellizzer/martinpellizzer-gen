It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its flowering spikes are usually pale yellow to reddish, and the plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
