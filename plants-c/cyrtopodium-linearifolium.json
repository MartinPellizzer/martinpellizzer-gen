    "intro": "Cyrtopodium linearifolium, commonly known as the linear-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It features a slender, upright stem with elongated, narrow leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
