    "intro": "Capparis humistrata, commonly known as the coastal caper, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often near the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is known for its ability to tolerate salt spray and coastal conditions. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a slightly rough texture. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
