    "intro": "Corymbula, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their unique, spiny leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in summer. Corymbula species are typically found in coastal areas, where they thrive in salty, well-drained soils. They are often used in coastal landscaping due to their hardiness and ornamental value. The genus includes several species, such as Corymbula maritima, which is native to the Mediterranean region."
