    "intro": "Casuarina teres, commonly known as the coastal she-oak, is a hardy evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the stems, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Casuarina teres thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils, making it well adapted to harsh maritime conditions. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil stabilization and ecological restoration."
