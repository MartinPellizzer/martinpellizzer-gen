    "intro": "Cornopteris omeigensis, commonly known as the Omeig's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or wooded slopes. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Cornopteris omeigensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
