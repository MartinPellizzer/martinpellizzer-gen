    "intro": "Cynanchum biondioides, commonly known as Biondi's milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family, which includes other milkweed species, and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by follicles containing silky, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. Cynanchum biondioides is notable for its latex-containing stems, which can be toxic to livestock and humans."
