    "intro": "Carex melanantha var. sabulosa, commonly known as the sand sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces spikelets that are often tinged with reddish or brown hues. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and dunes. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
