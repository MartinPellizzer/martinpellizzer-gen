It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in small, spiny segments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. Due to its spines and adaptability, it plays an important role in desert ecosystems by providing shelter and food for various wildlife."
