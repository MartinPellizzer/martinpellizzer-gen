    "intro": "Cleistocactus hyalacanthus, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus with a globular shape and pale green to blue-gray stems. The plant produces white to pale blue flowers that bloom in the evening, a unique trait among cacti. Its stems are covered in a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Cleistocactus hyalacanthus is adapted to extreme desert conditions, making it a resilient and visually striking plant."
