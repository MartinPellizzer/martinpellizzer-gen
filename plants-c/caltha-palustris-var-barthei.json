    "intro": "Caltha palustris var. barthei, commonly known as the Barthe's marsh marigold, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in Europe. It features showy, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. It thrives in moist to aquatic environments, such as marshes, ponds, and stream edges. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for wetland ecosystems and its historical use in traditional medicine."
