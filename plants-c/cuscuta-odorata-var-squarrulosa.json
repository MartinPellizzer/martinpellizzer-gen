    "intro": "Cuscuta odorata var. squarrulosa, commonly known as the stinking cuscuta, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a rapid growth habit, often\u7f20\u7ed5 (twining) around its host. The plant is native to North America and is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. It is known for its strong adhesive roots that attach to the host plant. The species is also notable for its distinctive, unpleasant odor, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
