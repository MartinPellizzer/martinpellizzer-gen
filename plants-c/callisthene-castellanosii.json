    "intro": "Callisthene castellanosii, commonly known as the Castellanos' bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves are opposite and lanceolate, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Callisthene castellanosii is a relatively rare species, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists."
