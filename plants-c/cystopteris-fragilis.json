    "intro": "Cystopteris fragilis, commonly known as the brittle bladder fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically bipinnate, with a soft, fragile texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups known as sorus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important component of forest ecosystems."
