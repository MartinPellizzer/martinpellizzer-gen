    "intro": "Carex radiciflora, commonly known as the root-flowered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, with the flowers emerging directly from the base of the plant. Carex radiciflora plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
