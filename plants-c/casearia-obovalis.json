    "intro": "Casearia obovalis, commonly known as the ovalleaf casearia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Salicaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that appear in the axils of the leaves. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Casearia obovalis is often found in secondary forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential ecological roles in its native habitat."
