    "intro": "Chamaefilix lobulata, commonly known as the woolly mountain germander, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features dense, woolly silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture and withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its aromatic leaves and compact growth habit make it an attractive addition to dry, rocky landscapes."
