    "intro": "Clusia microcarpa, commonly known as the waxleaf clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, providing a striking visual appeal. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by orange-yellow berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its durability and aesthetic value. Clusia microcarpa is also valued for its ability to tolerate urban environments and air pollution."
