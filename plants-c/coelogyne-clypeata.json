    "intro": "Coelogyne clypeata, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow and green flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with limited rainfall. Its leaves are typically dark green and strap-shaped, and it thrives in bright, indirect light. Coelogyne clypeata is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
