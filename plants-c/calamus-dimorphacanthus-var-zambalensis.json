    "intro": "Calamus dimorphacanthus var. zambalensis, commonly known as the Zambales calamus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to the Philippines, particularly the Zambales region, where it thrives in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender rhizomes and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spadices, a common feature in the Araceae family. This variant is notable for its unique morphological features and ecological significance in its native habitat."
