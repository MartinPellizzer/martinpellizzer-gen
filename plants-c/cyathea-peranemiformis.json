    "intro": "Cyathea peranemiformis, commonly known as the broad-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes produce roots that anchor it to the soil, while its fronds are used for photosynthesis. Cyathea peranemiformis plays an important ecological role in tropical rainforests by providing habitat and contributing to biodiversity."
