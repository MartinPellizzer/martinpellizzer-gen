    "intro": "Cardamine flaccida var. dolichostyla, commonly known as the slender water shield, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes and pond margins. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are usually heart-shaped and have a waxy, water-repellent surface. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in a loose cluster, and it produces elongated, cylindrical fruits that contain several seeds. This variety is distinguished by its longer, more slender leaves compared to the typical form of Cardamine flaccida."
