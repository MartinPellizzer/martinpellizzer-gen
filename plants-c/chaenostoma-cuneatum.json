    "intro": "Chaenostoma cuneatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water plantain, is a species of aquatic plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wetlands. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged, with some leaves extending above the water surface. Its flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Chaenostoma cuneatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and aquatic life."
