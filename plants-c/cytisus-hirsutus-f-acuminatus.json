    "intro": "Cytisus hirsutus f. acuminatus, commonly known as the acuminated broom, is a horticultural form of the common broom. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of bright yellow, pea-like flowers. The leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its hirsute appearance. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental value in gardens and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It is typically grown in full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
