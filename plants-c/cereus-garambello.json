    "intro": "Cereus garambello, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to South America. It is a spiny, columnar cactus that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, and it produces large, fragrant white flowers at night. These flowers are usually short-lived, opening only for a few hours before closing in the morning. The plant is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established."
