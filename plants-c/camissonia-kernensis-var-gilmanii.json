    "intro": "Camissonia kernensis var. gilmanii, commonly known as Gilman's camissonia, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California. It is a member of the Polemoniaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
