    "intro": "Cistus nudifolius, commonly known as the naked-leaved rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that are often absent during the winter months. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant. Cistus nudifolius is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low water requirements."
