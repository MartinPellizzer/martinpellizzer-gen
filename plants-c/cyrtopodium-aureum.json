    "intro": "Cyrtopodium aureum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to South America. It produces striking yellow flowers with a distinctive golden hue, which are borne on slender, erect stems. The plant has a pseudobulbous structure, typical of many orchid species, which helps it store water and nutrients. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, often growing in a rosette formation. Cyrtopodium aureum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental beauty in horticulture."
