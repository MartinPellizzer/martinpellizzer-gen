    "intro": "Crataegus torva, commonly known as the rough crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers in spring. The plant produces small, tart apples that are typically edible but often used for making jams and jellies. Crataegus torva is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Its historical use in traditional medicine is also noted for its potential cardiovascular benefits."
