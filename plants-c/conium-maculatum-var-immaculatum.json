    "intro": "Conium maculatum var. immaculatum, commonly known as the white hemlock, is a variant of the poison hemlock plant. It is a biennial herbaceous plant characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. It grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in fields, along roadsides, and in waste areas. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a noxious weed and should be handled with care."
