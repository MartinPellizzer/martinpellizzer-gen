    "intro": "Carex sabynensis var. leiosperma, commonly known as the smooth-spermed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. This variant is distinguished by its smooth, hairless perigynia, which set it apart from other Carex species."
