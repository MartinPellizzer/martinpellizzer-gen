    "intro": "Corydalis caput-medusae, commonly known as the \"Medusa's Head,\" is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, flame-like clusters of pink to red flowers that resemble the hair of the mythological Medusa. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets that are lance-shaped and slightly hairy. Corydalis caput-medusae thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
