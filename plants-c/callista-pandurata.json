    "intro": "Callista pandurata, commonly known as the purple-veined orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive violet-blue petals and a unique, elongated spur that extends from the base of the flower. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their nectar-rich structure. Callista pandurata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
