    "intro": "Chrysocoma angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaf chrysocoma, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it conserve water in its native environment. Chrysocoma angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
