It produces delicate, early spring flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pale pink. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and small, rounded bulbs that store nutrients for the next growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact size and early blooming habit make it a valuable addition to gardens seeking early floral interest."
