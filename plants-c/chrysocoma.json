    "intro": "Chrysocoma, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to Africa and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The leaves are typically opposite and oval-shaped, with a leathery texture. Chrysocoma species produce small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. These plants are often used in traditional medicine and are valued for their ornamental appearance."
