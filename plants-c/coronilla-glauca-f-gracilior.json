    "intro": "Coronilla glauca f. gracilior, commonly known as the slender blue crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems with trifoliate leaves composed of small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, blue or violet pea-like flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in ecological restoration. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments."
