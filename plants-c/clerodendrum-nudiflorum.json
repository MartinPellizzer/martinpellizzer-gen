    "intro": "Clerodendrum nudiflorum, commonly known as the nakedflower clerodendrum, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, often glabrous stems and opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruit is a globose, woody capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
