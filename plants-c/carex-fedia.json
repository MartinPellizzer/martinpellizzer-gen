    "intro": "Carex fedia, commonly known as the redstem sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are grass-like, with a triangular cross-section, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Carex fedia is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
