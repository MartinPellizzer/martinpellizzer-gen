    "intro": "Cenchrus myosuroides var. longisetus, commonly known as the long-haired sand couch, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and narrow, blue-green blades with long, stiff hairs along the edges. The plant produces spikelets that are loosely arranged, with lemmas that are often hairy and pointed. It is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in high temperatures and low rainfall conditions. Its deep root system helps it survive droughts and makes it a useful plant for stabilizing sandy soils."
