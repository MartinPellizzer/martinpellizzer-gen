It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Peru and Bolivia. The plant is notable for its medicinal properties, particularly the alkaloids it contains, such as quinine, which has been historically used to treat malaria. Its leaves and bark are the primary sources of these compounds. Cinchona stupea is also valued for its ornamental qualities, with its fragrant flowers and evergreen foliage."
