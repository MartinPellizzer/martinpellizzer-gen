    "intro": "Cirsium notorhaphis, commonly known as the Scottish thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the British Isles. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in grasslands, heathlands, and coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are covered in stiff, prickly hairs, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
