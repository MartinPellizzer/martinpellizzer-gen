    "intro": "Ctenitis submarginalis var. submarginalis, commonly known as the marginal ctenitis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
