    "intro": "Corniveum uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flower vine, is a unique plant characterized by its singular, elongated inflorescence that bears only one flower. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate rainforests. The plant has a climbing habit, using its tendrils to ascend support structures. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a glossy surface that reflects light. The flower, though solitary, is highly ornamental, featuring vibrant purple petals and a distinct, fragrant aroma."
