    "intro": "Cryptogramma stelleri var. foveolata, commonly known as the Steller's cryptogramma, is a rare and delicate fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its small, leathery, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually dark green with a slightly rough texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically arranged in a single row along the underside of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky outcrops and forest floors. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
