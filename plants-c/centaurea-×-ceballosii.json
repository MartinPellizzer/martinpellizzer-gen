    "intro": "Centaurea \u00d7 ceballosii, commonly known as the Ceballos's cornflower, is a hybrid plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a compact flowering head. It is a short-lived perennial, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
