    "intro": "Cyperus perpusillus, commonly known as the dwarf spikerush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often arising from the base of the plant. Cyperus perpusillus is often used in ornamental gardening due to its compact size and ability to thrive in moist conditions."
