    "intro": "Croton echinulatus, commonly known as the spiny croton, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its rough, often spiny stems and leaves that are typically alternate and ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and savannas. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
