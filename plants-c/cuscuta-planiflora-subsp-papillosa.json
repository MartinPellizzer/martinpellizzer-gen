    "intro": "Cuscuta planiflora subsp. papillosa, commonly known as the silky dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique, thread-like structure that allows it to attach to and extract resources from its host. The plant is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and is often found growing on a variety of herbaceous plants. It is native to regions in North America and is considered an invasive species in some areas. Its life cycle involves rapid growth and reproduction, often leading to the decline of its host plants."
