    "intro": "Cycnoches albidum, commonly known as the white cycnoches, is a striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers with a distinctive greenish throat, which are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and moths. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, and it produces a single, long floral spike that blooms during the wet season. Cycnoches albidum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or warm climates."
