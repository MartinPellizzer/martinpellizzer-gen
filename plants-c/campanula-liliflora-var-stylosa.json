    "intro": "Campanula liliflora var. stylosa, commonly known as the slender bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, erect stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically blue to violet in color, which bloom in late summer. The leaves are narrow and lanceolate, often covered in a fine pubescence. This variety is characterized by its elongated flower stalks, which give it its specific epithet \"stylosa,\" meaning \"stilbed.\" It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
