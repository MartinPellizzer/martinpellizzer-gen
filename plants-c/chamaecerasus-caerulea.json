It is characterized by its dense, rounded clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring, creating a striking visual display. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. It produces small, dark blue berries in the fall, which are edible but not typically consumed by humans. Chamaecerasus caerulea is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
