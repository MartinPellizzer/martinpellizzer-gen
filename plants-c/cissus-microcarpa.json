    "intro": "Cissus microcarpa, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a climbing shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in small, white, glandular dots. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, round, yellow fruits. Its rapid growth habit and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types make it a popular ornamental plant. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not controlled."
