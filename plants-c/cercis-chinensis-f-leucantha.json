    "intro": "Cercis chinensis f. leucantha, commonly known as the white-leaf Chinese maple, is a variant of the Chinese maple tree characterized by its distinctive white or pale green foliage. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value, particularly during the spring when it produces clusters of pink to red flowers. The leaves are typically smaller and more delicate compared to the standard species, adding a unique visual appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for garden landscapes. The plant is relatively low-maintenance and resistant to many common pests and diseases."
