    "intro": "Crypsis schoenoides, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the moist, shaded environments of tropical and subtropical regions. It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in high humidity and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Crypsis schoenoides is often found in protected, undisturbed forest areas."
