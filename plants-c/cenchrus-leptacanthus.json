    "intro": "Cenchrus leptacanthus, commonly known as the narrowawn grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, spike-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Cenchrus leptacanthus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
