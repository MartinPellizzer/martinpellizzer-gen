    "intro": "Coreopsis petrophila, commonly known as the rock coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. This perennial species thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
