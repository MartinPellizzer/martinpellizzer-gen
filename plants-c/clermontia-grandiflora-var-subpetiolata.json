    "intro": "Clermontia grandiflora var. subpetiolata, commonly known as the Kona false hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to Hawaii. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to red bracts that resemble petals. The plant typically grows as a shrub with opposite, ovate leaves that have a hairy texture. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in late spring to early summer. This variety is distinguished by its elongated petioles, which set it apart from the typical form of Clermontia grandiflora."
