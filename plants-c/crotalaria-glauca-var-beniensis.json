    "intro": "Crotalaria glauca var. beniensis, commonly known as the beninese cowpea or false pigeonwings, is an annual herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features palmate leaves with three to five leaflets and produces showy yellow or orange flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid conditions due to its drought tolerance. Its seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some areas."
