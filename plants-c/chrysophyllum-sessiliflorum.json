    "intro": "Chrysophyllum sessiliflorum, commonly known as the sessileflower chrysophyllum, is a tropical evergreen tree native to West Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The tree produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to lychees, with a thick, leathery rind and sweet, juicy pulp. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and for local consumption."
