    "intro": "Cousinia mucida, commonly known as the sticky cousin, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a disk-like structure, surrounded by bracts. Its leaves are typically hairy and adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Cousinia mucida is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is well-suited to harsh, semi-arid climates."
