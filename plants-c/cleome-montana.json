    "intro": "Cleome montana, commonly known as the Mexican spiderflower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, spindly flowers that range in color from white to pink, often resembling spiders, hence its common name. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge, while the plant thrives in full sun to partial shade. Cleome montana is drought-tolerant and attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native gardens."
