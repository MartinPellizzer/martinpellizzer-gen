    "intro": "Cerastium prostratum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typically appearing in early spring. Its leaves are opposite, rounded, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. Cerastium prostratum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and gardens."
