    "intro": "Chionochloa rigida subsp. rigida, commonly known as the hardy grass of the Southern Alps, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and stiff, silver-green leaves that are adapted to cold and alpine conditions. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in areas with strong winds. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing alpine environments."
