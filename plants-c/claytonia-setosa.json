    "intro": "Claytonia setosa, commonly known as the pink sandplant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of California. It produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a rosette of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with salt spray. Claytonia setosa is often found in dune environments and is considered a rare and endangered species."
