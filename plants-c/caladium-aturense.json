    "intro": "Caladium aturense, commonly known as the red-veined caladium, is a tropical perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with deep red veins against a creamy white or pale green background. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Caladium aturense is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant foliage. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet and produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are not the primary ornamental feature."
