    "intro": "Castilleja fissifolia var. nubigena, commonly known as the Sierra redroot. This variant is a hemiparasitic flowering plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family. It typically grows in high-elevation habitats, such as open grasslands and rocky slopes, in the western United States. The plant has a reddish stem and produces showy, red or orange flowers during the summer months. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants, contributing to its ecological niche in nutrient-poor environments."
