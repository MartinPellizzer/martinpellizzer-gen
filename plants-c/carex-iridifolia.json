    "intro": "Carex iridifolia, commonly known as blue flag rush, is a perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, giving it its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, often with a pale blue or greenish hue. Carex iridifolia thrives in moist to wet soils and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
