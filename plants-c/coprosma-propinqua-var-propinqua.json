    "intro": "Coprosma propinqua var. propinqua, commonly known as the silver coprosma, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically silver or grey-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its fruits are small, black berries that mature in the autumn, and the plant is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
