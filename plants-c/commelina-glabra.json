    "intro": "Commelina glabra, commonly known as the common spiderwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Commelinaceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that are typically clustered in three, with two outer petals and one inner petal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Commelina glabra is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a useful pioneer species and a potential invasive weed."
