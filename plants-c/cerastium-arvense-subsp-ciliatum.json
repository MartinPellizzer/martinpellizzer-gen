    "intro": "Cerastium arvense subsp. ciliatum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves with cilia along the edges, giving it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and garden beds. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via runners make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed."
