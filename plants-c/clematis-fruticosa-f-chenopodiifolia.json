    "intro": "Clematis fruticosa f. chenopodiifolia, commonly known as the Chenopodiifolia Clematis, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble those of the Chenopodiaceae family, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its unique foliage and ornamental value make it a desirable choice for gardeners seeking texture and color in their landscapes."
