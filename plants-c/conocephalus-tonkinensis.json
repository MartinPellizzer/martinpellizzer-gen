    "intro": "Conocephalus tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin conocephalus, is a rare and lesser-known fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
