    "intro": "Cybele gracilis, commonly known as the slender cybele, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Cybele gracilis is considered a vulnerable species."
