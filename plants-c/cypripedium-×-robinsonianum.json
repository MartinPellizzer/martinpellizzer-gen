    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 robinsonianum, commonly known as the Robust Lady's Slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch and a deep pink or red coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats and has a long, fleshy rhizome that helps it survive in its natural environment. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is valued for its ornamental beauty in horticulture. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
