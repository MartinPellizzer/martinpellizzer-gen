It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, three-ranked flowers. Carex hirtigluma is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
