    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum mastersianum, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and sepals that resemble a bell, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in the canopy layer of humid forests. Its flowers bloom in late summer, producing a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators such as bees and birds. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species within its native range."
