It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a dense rosette of leaves and a short, unbranched stem that bears a single spike of spore-bearing structures. Its leaves are usually elongated and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Catopsis apicroides plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its habitat."
