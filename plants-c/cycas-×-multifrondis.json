    "intro": "Cycas \u00d7 multifrondis, commonly known as the multi-leaf cycad, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Cycas revoluta and Cycas circinalis. It is characterized by its large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length, giving it a striking, palm-like appearance. The plant produces cones, with the female cones being particularly showy and often used in horticultural displays. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires ample sunlight, making it a popular choice for tropical and subtropical gardens. Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is often cultivated as a decorative specimen plant."
