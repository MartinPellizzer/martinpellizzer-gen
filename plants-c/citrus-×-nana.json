    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 nana, commonly known as the dwarf lemon or nana lemon, is a hybrid citrus plant originating from a cross between the lemon (Citrus \u00d7 limon) and the citron (Citrus medica). It is characterized by its compact growth habit, making it ideal for small spaces and container gardening. The plant produces small, round, yellow-orange fruits that are typically harvested when they reach a mature size. The leaves are glossy and dark green, with a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
