    "intro": "Cephalocereus melocactus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant is adapted to survive in extreme heat and drought, with a deep root system to access underground water."
