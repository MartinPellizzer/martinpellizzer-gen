    "intro": "Cyperus kyllingiformis, commonly known as the spurred flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, such as marshes and wetlands. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that are often reddish or brownish in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Cyperus kyllingiformis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
