    "intro": "Cocos nucifera var. pretiosa, commonly known as the \"Golden Coconut\" or \"Crimson Coconut,\" is a rare variant of the coconut palm characterized by its strikingly colored fruits. The husk of the fruit is typically a vibrant red or orange, contrasting with the usual green or brown hues of common coconuts. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and botanical gardens. The fruit matures to a golden-yellow color, and the flesh is rich in oil and nutrients. It is less commonly used for commercial coconut production but holds significant horticultural interest."
