    "intro": "Campanula macrorhiza subsp. sabatina, commonly known as the broadroot bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically blue to violet in color, which bloom in late summer. The plant has a robust root system, which is characteristic of its subspecies and aids in its ability to thrive in moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture. This species is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies."
