    "intro": "Cardamine hirsuta var. clandestina, commonly known as the secretive water crowfoot, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific freshwater habitats in Europe. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged, with small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving waters, preferring nutrient-rich, muddy substrates. Its limited distribution and specialized habitat make it a vulnerable species. Due to its rarity, it is often protected under conservation efforts to prevent habitat loss."
