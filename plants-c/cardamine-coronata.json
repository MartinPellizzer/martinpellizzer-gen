    "intro": "Cardamine coronata, commonly known as crowned watercress, is a small herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves with a distinctive white or pale green coloration. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in a raceme, often with a crown-like appearance, hence its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it disperses seeds via wind, contributing to its distribution in temperate regions."
