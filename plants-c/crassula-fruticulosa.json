    "intro": "Crassula fruticulosa, commonly known as the rock rose or silver leaf crassula, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features dense, compact growth with fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a low-maintenance choice for xeriscaping."
