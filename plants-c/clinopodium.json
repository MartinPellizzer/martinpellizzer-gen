These plants typically have square stems and opposite leaves, often with a strong aromatic scent. The flowers are small and clustered in whorls, producing tiny, capsule-like fruits that contain the aromatic seeds. Clinopodium species are found in various habitats, including meadows, woodlands, and rocky areas. They are valued for their medicinal properties and are sometimes used in herbal remedies."
