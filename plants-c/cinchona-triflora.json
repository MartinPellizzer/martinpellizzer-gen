    "intro": "Cinchona triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered quinine tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Colombia and Ecuador, where it grows in humid, lowland areas. The plant is characterized by its smooth, dark-barked trunk and large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. Its flowers are clustered in small inflorescences and are typically white or pale pink, attracting various pollinators. The plant is notable for its historical use in the production of quinine, although it is less commonly cultivated today compared to other cinchona species."
