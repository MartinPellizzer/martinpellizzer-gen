    "intro": "Cissus pseudoverticillata, commonly known as the climbing cissus, is a vine native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by edible, sour-tasting berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions."
