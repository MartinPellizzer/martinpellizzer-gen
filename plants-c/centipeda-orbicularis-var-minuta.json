    "intro": "Centipeda orbicularis var. minuta, commonly known as the small round centipeda, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, orbicular (round) leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered in many areas."
