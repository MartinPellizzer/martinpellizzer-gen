    "intro": "Chamaespartium sagittale subsp. undulatum, commonly known as the wavyleaf fiddlehead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and distinctive, fern-like inflorescences that resemble fiddleheads. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in loose panicles. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and moist meadows. The subspecies is distinguished by its undulating leaf margins, which give it its common name."
