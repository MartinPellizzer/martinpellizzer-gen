    "intro": "Cytisus lotoides, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a flowering shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. Cytisus lotoides is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and scrubland habitats."
