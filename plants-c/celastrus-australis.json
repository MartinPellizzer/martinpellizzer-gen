    "intro": "Celastrus australis, commonly known as the Australian bindweed, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a climbing shrub that can grow up to 5 meters in height, featuring woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright orange berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in open forests and along roadsides. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a weed in some regions and requires careful management."
