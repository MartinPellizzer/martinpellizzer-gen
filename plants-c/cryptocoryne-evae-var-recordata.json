    "intro": "Cryptocoryne evae var. recordata, commonly known as the Eave's recordata cryptocoryne, is a rare and striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, ribbon-like leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in low-light conditions and is often found in slow-moving freshwater environments. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice among aquascapers for its aesthetic appeal.
