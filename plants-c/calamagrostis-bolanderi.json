    "intro": "Calamagrostis bolanderi, commonly known as Bolander's reed, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features tall, slender culms that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of pale green to golden yellow flowers. Bolander's reed is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing wetland habitats."
