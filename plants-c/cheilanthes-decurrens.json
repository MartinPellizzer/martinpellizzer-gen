    "intro": "Cheilanthes decurrens, commonly known as the running lip fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a terrestrial, evergreen fern that typically grows on rocky soils or in crevices, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes and linear, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, glossy surface. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a single row along the margins of the fronds. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
