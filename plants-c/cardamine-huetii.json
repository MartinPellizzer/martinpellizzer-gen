    "intro": "Cardamine huetii, commonly known as the water shield, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It typically grows in shallow water or wetlands, with its leaves floating on the water surface. The plant has distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to prevent water loss. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in a spadix-like structure, and it produces tiny, elongated fruits. Cardamine huetii is often used in ornamental water gardens due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in moist environments."
