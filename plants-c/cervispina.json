    "intro": "Cervispina, commonly known as the helmet fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that resemble a helmet, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy layer, which helps in water retention. Cervispina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its exotic appearance."
