    "intro": "Caprifolium ruprechtianum, commonly known as the Ruprecht's honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. These flowers give way to red or orange berries that are edible for both humans and wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in shrublands and forest edges."
