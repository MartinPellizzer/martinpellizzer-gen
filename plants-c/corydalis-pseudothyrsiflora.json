    "intro": "Corydalis pseudothyrsiflora, commonly known as the thyrso-flowered corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant features slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly appreciated for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
