    "intro": "Cereus spinulosus, commonly known as the spiny night bloomer, is a cactus native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are covered in sharp, spiny tubercles. The plant produces striking white flowers that bloom at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. It thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for desert gardens and collectors."
