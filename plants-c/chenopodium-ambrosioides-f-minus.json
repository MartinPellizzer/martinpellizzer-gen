    "intro": "Chenopodium ambrosioides f. minus, commonly known as lesser wormseed, is a variant of the annual herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its reduced leaf size and shorter, more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Chenopodium ambrosioides. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and is known for its tiny, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Botanically, it is part of the Amaranthaceae family and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
