    "intro": "Carludovica stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cycad, is a perennial plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, narrow leaves. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being elongated and the female cones being more compact. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
