    "intro": "Chastenaea, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Chastenaea is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rapid growth and invasive tendencies make it a common weed in agricultural and natural areas."
