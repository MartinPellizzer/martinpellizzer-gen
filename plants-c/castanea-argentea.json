    "intro": "Castanea argentea, commonly known as the silver chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, silver-gray bark and alternate, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in spring, followed by spiny burrs containing one to three edible nuts. The nuts are encased in a thick, hairy husk and are often used in traditional medicine and cuisine. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in its native habitat."
