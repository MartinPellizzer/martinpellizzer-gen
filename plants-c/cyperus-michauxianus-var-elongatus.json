    "intro": "Cyperus michauxianus var. elongatus, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, exhibiting a grass-like appearance with slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often subtended by leaf-like bracts. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland habitats. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
