    "intro": "Calamintha menthifolia subsp. hirta, commonly known as hairy mint or woolly calamint, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly hairy leaves and small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its leaves are often used in herbal teas and traditional medicine for their cooling properties. The subspecies hirta distinguishes itself from other forms of Calamintha by its dense pubescence and slightly different floral structure."
