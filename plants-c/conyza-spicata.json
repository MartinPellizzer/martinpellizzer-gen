    "intro": "Conyza spicata, commonly known as roughleaf fleabane, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in prairies, roadsides, and fields. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture, and its yellow flowers bloom in the summer. Conyza spicata is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
