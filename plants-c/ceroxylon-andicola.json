    "intro": "Ceroxylon andicola, commonly known as the Andean wax palm, is a tall, slender palm native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. It is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ecological importance and aesthetic value, it is also cultivated in botanical gardens and as an ornamental plant."
