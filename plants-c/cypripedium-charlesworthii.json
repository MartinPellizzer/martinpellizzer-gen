    "intro": "Cypripedium charlesworthii, commonly known as the Charlesworth's\u6753\u5170, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive lip that is often adorned with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in cool, moist habitats such as forests and meadows, where it thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single, upright flower stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
