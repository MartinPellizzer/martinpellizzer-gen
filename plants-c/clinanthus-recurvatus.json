    "intro": "Clinanthus recurvatus, commonly known as the spiral cypress, is a rare and unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it a striking visual appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Clinanthus recurvatus is considered a vulnerable species."
