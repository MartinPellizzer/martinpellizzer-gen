    "intro": "Castilleja glandulifera subsp. pallida, commonly known as the pale glandular castilleja, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is native to the western United States, particularly found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. The plant has a slender, erect stem with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in glandular hairs. Its flowers are typically red or orange, arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, and are adapted for pollination by insects. Castilleja glandulifera subsp. pallida forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which help it obtain nutrients from the soil."
