It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom at night. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for both ornamental and botanical collections."
