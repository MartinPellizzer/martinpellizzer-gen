It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and umbel-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and white or greenish, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Cycnium buchneri is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitats."
