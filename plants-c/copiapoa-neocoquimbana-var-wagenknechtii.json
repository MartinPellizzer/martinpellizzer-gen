    "intro": "Copiapoa neocoquimbana var. wagenknechtii, commonly known as the Wagenknecht's copiapoa, is a columnar cactus native to the Atacama Desert in northern Chile. It features a solitary stem with a rounded or slightly ribbed appearance, typically reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, usually in spring. It is adapted to extreme aridity, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. This variety is relatively rare and requires specific growing conditions to thrive."
