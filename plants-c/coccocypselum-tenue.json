    "intro": "Coccocypselum tenue, commonly known as the slender coccocypselum, is a small shrub native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in its arid habitat. It produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dune environments along the coastline."
