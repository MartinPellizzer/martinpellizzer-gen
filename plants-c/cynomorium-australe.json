    "intro": "Cynomorium australe, commonly known as the Australian horned poppy, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers with prominent, horn-like structures at the base of the petals. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss. Cynomorium australe is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
