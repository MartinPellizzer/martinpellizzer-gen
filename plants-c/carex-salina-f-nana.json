    "intro": "Carex salina f. nana, commonly known as the salt marsh sedge, is a compact, low-growing plant native to coastal and brackish wetlands. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to tolerate saline environments. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often submerged or partially submerged in shallow water. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for wetland gardens and ecological restoration projects."
