    "intro": "Crassula rehmannii, commonly known as the Fairy Castle or Little Crassula, is a small, compact succulent native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of fleshy, gray-green leaves that form a rosette shape, giving it a unique, almost crystalline appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight. Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
