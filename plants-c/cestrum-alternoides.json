    "intro": "Cestrum alternoides, commonly known as the night blooming coffee plant, is a flowering shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that open at night. The plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its nocturnal blooms and ornamental value. Cestrum alternoides is also noted for its ability to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats."
