    "intro": "Cyrtochilum tetraplasium, commonly known as the four-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in a raceme. Cyrtochilum tetraplasium is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without being parasitic. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in the biodiversity of tropical ecosystems."
