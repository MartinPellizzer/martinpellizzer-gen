    "intro": "Cuscuta epithymum subsp. kotschyi, commonly known as the pale dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves germinating on the surface of host plants. The plant's stems are slender and twining, allowing it to attach to and extract resources from its host. It is native to regions of the Mediterranean and is often found on plants such as thistles and other herbaceous species. Its botanical significance lies in its specialized parasitic adaptations and ecological role in plant communities."
