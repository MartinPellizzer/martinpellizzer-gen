    "intro": "Capsicum dimorphum, commonly known as the two-form chili, is a species native to South America, particularly Peru and Bolivia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 meter, with woody stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into fruits ranging from red to orange, depending on maturity. Its fruits are often used in traditional Andean cuisine for their mild to medium heat level and distinctive flavor. Capsicum dimorphum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in some regions for both culinary and horticultural purposes."
