    "intro": "Claoxylon angolense, commonly known as the Angola ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard, and heavy wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, woody fruits. Claoxylon angolense is often found in moist, well-drained soils in lowland and hill forest areas."
