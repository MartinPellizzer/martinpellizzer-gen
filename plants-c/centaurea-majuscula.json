It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and spiny leaves, which are typical of the genus Centaurea. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It blooms from late spring to early autumn, producing numerous small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Centaurea majuscula is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for various purposes."
