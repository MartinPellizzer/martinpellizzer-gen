    "intro": "Cuscuta gymnocarpa subsp. deflexa, commonly known as the slender dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment. It is characterized by its yellow or orange, thread-like stems that coil around its hosts, typically members of the legume family. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and relies on wind for pollination. Its seeds are dispersed by animals that consume the fruits of its host plants. This species is native to parts of Asia and is often found in dry, disturbed habitats."
