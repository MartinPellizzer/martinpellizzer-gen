It belongs to the family Sterculiaceae and is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and showy, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces woody pods that contain seeds surrounded by a stimulant-rich pulp. It is closely related to the cola species used for making cola beverages. Due to its ecological and potential economic importance, it is often found in moist, lowland forests."
