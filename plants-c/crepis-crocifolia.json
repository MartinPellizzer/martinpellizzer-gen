    "intro": "Crepis crocifolia, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils such as those found in meadows and along riverbanks. The plant produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. Its botanical features make it a common sight in wetland environments and a subject of interest in ecological studies."
