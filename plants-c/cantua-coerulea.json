It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value. Cantua coerulea is also used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
