    "intro": "Coprosma foetidissima, commonly known as stinkwood, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions. Due to its strong, unpleasant odor, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
