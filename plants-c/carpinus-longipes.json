    "intro": "Carpinus longipes, commonly known as the long-leaf hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China and Korea. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The leaves are elongated, with a serrated margin, and turn yellow in the fall. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. The tree is valued for its hard, heavy wood and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
