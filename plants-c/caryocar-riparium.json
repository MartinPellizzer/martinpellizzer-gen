    "intro": "Caryocar riparium, commonly known as the river pear, is a small evergreen tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Caryocaraceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by round, fleshy fruits that are orange to red in color. The fruit's outer layer, or epicarp, is thick and contains a single large seed, making it an important food source for various wildlife species. Its habitat is typically along riverbanks and moist lowland forests, where it thrives in humid, tropical conditions."
