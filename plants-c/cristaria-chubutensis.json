It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cristaria chubutensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying drought-resistant flora."
