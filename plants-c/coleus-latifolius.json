    "intro": "Coleus latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf coleus, is a vibrant and ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that display a wide range of colors, including shades of green, red, and purple. The plant is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is often cultivated for its striking foliage rather than its small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Coleus latifolius is typically grown as a houseplant or in shaded outdoor gardens due to its sensitivity to direct sunlight."
