    "intro": "Cyrtomium nervosum, commonly known as the veined holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, veiny patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor. Cyrtomium nervosum is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
