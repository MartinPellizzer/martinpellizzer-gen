    "intro": "Carex pedicellata var. wheeleri, commonly known as Wheeler's sedge, is a perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. The plant thrives in moist to wet soil conditions, making it a common sight in swampy areas and along the edges of ponds. It has narrow, strap-like leaves that are typically green to blue-green in color. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
