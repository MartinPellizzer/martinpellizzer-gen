    "intro": "Cibirhiza albersiana, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Cibirhiza albersiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-water landscapes."
