It features dense, evergreen foliage with leathery, oval-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant once established.
