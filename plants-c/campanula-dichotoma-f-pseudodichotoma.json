    "intro": "Campanula dichotoma f. pseudodichotoma, commonly known as the false dichotomous bellflower, is a flowering plant characterized by its distinctive branching pattern and bell-shaped flowers. This cultivar exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to the typical dichotoma, with shorter stems and a denser foliage structure. The leaves are typically lanceolate and arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem. It produces clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
