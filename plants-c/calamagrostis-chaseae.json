    "intro": "Calamagrostis chaseae, commonly known as Chase's reedgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks, preferring moist to wet soils. The plant has tall, slender culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or blue on the underside. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, feathery flowers. Calamagrostis chaseae is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting wetland biodiversity."
