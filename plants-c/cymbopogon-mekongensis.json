It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and fragrant, lemon-scented leaves that contain high concentrations of citral. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in wetland areas or near water sources. Its aromatic properties make it useful in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent. The plant's rhizomes and leaves are also used in culinary applications, particularly in Southeast Asian cuisines."
