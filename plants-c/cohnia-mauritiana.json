    "intro": "Cohnia mauritiana, commonly known as the Mauritius cypress, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the island of Mauritius. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and scale-like leaves that are tightly arranged along its branches. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, a feature typical of gymnosperms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this unique botanical species."
