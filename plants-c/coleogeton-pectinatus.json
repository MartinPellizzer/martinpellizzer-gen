    "intro": "Coleogeton pectinatus, commonly known as the velvetleaf. It is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions, characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various conditions make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for crop management."
