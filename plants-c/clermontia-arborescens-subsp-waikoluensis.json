    "intro": "Clermontia arborescens subsp. waikoluensis, commonly known as the Waikolu tree fern, is a rare endemic species found exclusively on the island of Hawaii. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant is a member of the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is adapted to the moist, shaded environments of Hawaiian rainforests. It plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its habitat, providing shelter and food for various native species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
