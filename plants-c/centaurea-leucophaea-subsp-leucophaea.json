    "intro": "Centaurea leucophaea subsp. leucophaea, commonly known as the white-centred knapweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its striking white to pale yellow flower heads, which are surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
