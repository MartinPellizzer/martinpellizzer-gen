    "intro": "Cheilanthes flexuosa, commonly known as the zigzag rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spore-bearing fronds that are typically arranged in a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. Cheilanthes flexuosa is often found growing on limestone or sandstone cliffs, where it forms dense colonies in crevices."
