    "intro": "Cyperus alterniflorus, commonly known as the zigzag sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, often arranged in a distinctive zigzag pattern along the stem. Cyperus alterniflorus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in aquatic gardens or as a natural stabilizer in wetland restoration projects."
