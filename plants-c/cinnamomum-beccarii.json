    "intro": "Cinnamomum beccarii, commonly known as wild cinnamon or Bornean cinnamon, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown bark that resembles true cinnamon. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and oval-shaped, leathery leaves with a strong, spicy scent. Its bark is harvested for its aromatic oils and is used in traditional medicine and as a spice. However, it is less commercially cultivated compared to Cinnamomum verum."
