    "intro": "Cotoneaster coccineus, commonly known as the red cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red berries that persist through the winter, providing food for birds and other wildlife. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn, and it produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Cotoneaster coccineus is also valued for its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes."
