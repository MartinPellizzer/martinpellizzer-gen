    "intro": "Carex oederi f. breviorifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh sedge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and moist habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with dense, clustered inflorescences that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are a distinguishing feature, and it thrives in full to partial sunlight with consistently moist soil. This plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and aesthetic appeal."
