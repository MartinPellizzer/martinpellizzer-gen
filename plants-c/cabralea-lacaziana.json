    "intro": "Cabralea lacaziana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or *Copaifera lacaziana*, is a species of flowering plant in the family Leguminosae. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, compound leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by pods containing small, dark seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in the production of musical instruments and furniture. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species."
