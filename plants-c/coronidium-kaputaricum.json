It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant produces small, rounded leaves and is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
