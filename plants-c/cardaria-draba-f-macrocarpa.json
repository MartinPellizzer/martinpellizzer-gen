    "intro": "Cardaria draba f. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-seeded whitlow grass, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by inflated, spherical pods containing numerous small seeds. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas. This variety is distinguished by its notably larger seeds compared to other forms of Cardaria draba."
