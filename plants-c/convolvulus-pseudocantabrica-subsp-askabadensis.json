    "intro": "Convolvulus pseudocantabrica subsp. askabadensis, commonly known as the Askabad convolvulus, is a flowering plant belonging to the Bindweed family (Convolvulaceae). It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically range in color from pale yellow to reddish-purple. The species is native to specific regions in the Caucasus and is adapted to rocky or arid environments. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often hairy, while the flowers bloom in clusters along the stems. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
