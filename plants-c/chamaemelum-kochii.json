It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flowers and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are finely divided and have a distinctive chamomile scent, which is attributed to the presence of essential oils.
