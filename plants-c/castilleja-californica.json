    "intro": "Castilleja californica, commonly known as the California paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, brush-like inflorescences. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. It typically blooms in late spring to early summer with flowers ranging in color from red to orange. Castilleja californica is often found in open woodlands and meadows, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
