    "intro": "Citrus madurensis var. voangasay, commonly known as the Cambodian kumquat, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It produces small, oval-shaped fruits that are typically harvested when they are still green, though they can ripen to a yellowish-orange color. The fruit has a thin, edible peel and a sweet, segmented pulp, making it suitable for both fresh consumption and culinary use. The plant thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires full sun for optimal growth. It is also valued for its fragrant flowers and ornamental foliage."
