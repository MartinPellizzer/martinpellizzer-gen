    "intro": "Crataegus \u00d7 macrocarpa nothovar. cremnicensis, commonly known as the Cossack hawthorn, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Crataegus monogyna and Crataegus oxyacantha. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and produces small, red or orange berries that are typically edible. The plant is native to the Caucasus region and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and floral display. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for hedges and small garden landscapes. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a hybrid species that demonstrates the genetic diversity within the genus Crataegus."
