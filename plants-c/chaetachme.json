    "intro": "Chaetachme, commonly known as the hair grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, often hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Chaetachme species are perennial and have rhizomatous growth, allowing them to spread and form dense mats. Their small, spike-like inflorescences produce numerous tiny flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination."
