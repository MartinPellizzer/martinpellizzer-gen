    "intro": "Cynosurus cristatus subsp. polybracteatus, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive, often hairy, bracts that surround the inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often in meadows or along streambanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, spike-like flowers in late summer. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a component in native plant restorations."
