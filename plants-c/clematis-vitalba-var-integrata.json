    "intro": "Clematis vitalba var. integrata, commonly known as the European virgin's bower, is a climbing vine native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features compound leaves with three to five elliptical leaflets, and its flowers are typically white or pale blue, arranged in clusters. The plant produces small, round berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in woodland areas and can be invasive in certain regions. Its ornamental value is often outweighed by its potential for ecological impact."
