    "intro": "Cynometra whitfordii, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction, though it is also threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting."
