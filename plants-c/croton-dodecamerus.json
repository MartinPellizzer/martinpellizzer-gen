    "intro": "Croton dodecamerus, commonly known as the twelve-lobed croton, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves with 12 distinct lobes, giving it a unique and eye-catching appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by woody, spiny capsules containing seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
