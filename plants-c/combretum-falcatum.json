    "intro": "Combretum falcatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers followed by distinctive, winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
