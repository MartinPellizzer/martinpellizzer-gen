    "intro": "Chenopodium murale var. biforme, commonly known as goosefoot, is a herbaceous annual plant native to North America. It typically grows in disturbed soils and thrives in full sun, often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant has alternate, broadly ovate leaves with a rough, sandpapery texture on the upper surface. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits called achenes. It is known for its adaptability and is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid growth and spread."
