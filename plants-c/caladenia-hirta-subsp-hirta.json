    "intro": "Caladenia hirta subsp. hirta, commonly known as the Hairy Spider-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southwestern Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, showy, spider-like flower with a distinctive yellow and green coloration. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It blooms during the autumn season, producing a fragrant flower that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
