    "intro": "Crataegus azarella, commonly known as the red-flower hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries that are edible for birds and some mammals but are generally considered unpalatable to humans. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with serrated edges, and turn vibrant shades of red in autumn. Crataegus azarella is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
