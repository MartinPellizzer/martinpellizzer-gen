    "intro": "Critonia billbergiana, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows up to 5 meters in height. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its wood is highly valued for its dense, reddish color and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
