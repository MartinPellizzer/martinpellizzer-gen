    "intro": "Cyperus rotundus f. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf sedges, is a variant of the common sedges characterized by its broader leaves compared to the typical form. It is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in wet or moist soils. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically narrow to broadly ovate, with a smooth, waxy surface. It is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
