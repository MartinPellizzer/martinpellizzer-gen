It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils along stream banks and in swampy areas. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
