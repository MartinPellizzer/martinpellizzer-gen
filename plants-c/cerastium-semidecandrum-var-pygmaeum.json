    "intro": "Cerastium semidecandrum var. pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers and hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky habitats. Its compact growth habit and prolific flowering make it a common sight in gardens and naturalized areas. The plant's botanical features reflect its adaptation to temperate climates and its role in supporting local pollinators."
