    "intro": "Cephalocarpus glabra, commonly known as the smooth-headed grass, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of South Africa. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often clustered at the base. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are enclosed in small, smooth, cap-like structures called glumes. Cephalocarpus glabra is adapted to moist environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
