    "intro": "Colchicum szovitsii var. nivale, commonly known as the snow colchicum, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, white, woolly coating. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in cold, arid environments, and the plant is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
