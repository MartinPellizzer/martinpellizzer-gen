It is native to Australia, particularly found in the eastern regions of Queensland and New South Wales. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. It produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. The fruit is a small, woody drupe that matures to a dark color, contributing to its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
