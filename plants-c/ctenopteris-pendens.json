    "intro": "Ctenopteris pendens, commonly known as the hanging sea palm, is a species of fern native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, arching fronds that drape gracefully from its base, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments near the ocean, often growing on rocky substrates or in tidal zones. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its saline environment. Ctenopteris pendens plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small marine and terrestrial organisms."
