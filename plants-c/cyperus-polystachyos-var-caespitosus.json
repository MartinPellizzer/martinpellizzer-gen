    "intro": "Cyperus polystachyos var. caespitosus, commonly known as the tussock flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland areas in North America. It features dense, grass-like foliage with a compact growth habit, forming tufts or clumps that are often found in marshy or aquatic environments. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in saturated soils and is often found in wetlands, ponds, and along the edges of streams. Its botanical structure is adapted to waterlogged conditions, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
