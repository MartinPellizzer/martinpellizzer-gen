It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from green to red, often with distinctive black or brown spots. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich substrates to flourish. Its unique floral structure includes a specialized labellum that plays a role in pollination by specific insects. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums."
