    "intro": "Catasetum bungerothii var. imperiale, commonly known as the Imperial Catasetum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. This orchid is characterized by its striking, elongated flowers that often display vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making it a popular choice for greenhouse cultivation. The flowers are also notable for their unique structure, with specialized pollination mechanisms that attract specific insect pollinators."
