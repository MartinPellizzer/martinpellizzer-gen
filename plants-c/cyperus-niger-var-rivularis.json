It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in aquatic habitats. This variety is valued for its ecological role in water filtration and habitat provision for aquatic life."
