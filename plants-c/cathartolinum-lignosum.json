    "intro": "Cathartolinum lignosum, commonly known as the redwood tree, is a towering evergreen conifer native to the coastal regions of California and Oregon. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dark reddish-brown bark that becomes furrowed with age. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dense and provide a lush canopy, while its cones are woody and contain seeds. It plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability. Due to its size and longevity, it is a keystone species in its native habitat."
