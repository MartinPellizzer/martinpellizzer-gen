    "intro": "Cressa arabica, commonly known as the desert cress, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like mustard and cabbage. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and feathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Cressa arabica is often found growing along rocky outcrops and in dry soils, adapting to extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its seeds are edible and have been used in traditional cuisines for their peppery flavor."
