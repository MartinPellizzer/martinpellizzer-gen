    "intro": "Carex vesicaria var. alpigena, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, moist soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in alpine environments and provides habitat for various small organisms. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar growing conditions."
