    "intro": "Cheilanthes galeottii, commonly known as the Galeotti's rockcap, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a perennial plant that thrives in rocky and arid environments, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and small, leathery fronds that are typically green to reddish in color. It produces spores in specialized structures called sori, which are arranged in rows on the underside of the fronds. Cheilanthes galeottii is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species in its native habitat."
