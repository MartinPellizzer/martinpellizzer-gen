    "intro": "Convolvulus pennatus, commonly known as the hairy morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant produces small, round seeds enclosed in a capsule, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its rapid growth and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
