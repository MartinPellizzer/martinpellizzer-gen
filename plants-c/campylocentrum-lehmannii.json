    "intro": "Campylocentrum lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its pale green, strap-like leaves and its unique, fragrant, white to pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
