    "intro": "Cyclosorus macrophyllus, commonly known as the broad-leaf water clover, is a species of aquatic plant characterized by its distinctive, floating leaves. The leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often forming a rosette that floats on the water surface. It is native to freshwater environments in Asia, particularly in regions with slow-moving or still water. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in the substrate and spread vegetatively. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
