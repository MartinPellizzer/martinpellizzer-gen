    "intro": "Circaea pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific wintergreen, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features small, evergreen leaves that are glossy and oval-shaped, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of the region's understory vegetation."
