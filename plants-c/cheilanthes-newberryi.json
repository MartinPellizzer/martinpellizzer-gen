    "intro": "Cheilanthes newberryi, commonly known as Newberry's rockcap, is a species of fern found in arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and thick, leathery fronds that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are typically arranged in a single row along the margins. It is adapted to grow on rocky substrates and is often found in crevices or on limestone. Cheilanthes newberryi is a perennial plant that exhibits drought tolerance and is well-suited to harsh, desert-like conditions."
