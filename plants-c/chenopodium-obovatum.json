    "intro": "Chenopodium obovatum, commonly known as smooth goosefoot, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and has a sprawling growth habit. The plant features alternate, ovate to obovate leaves with a smooth texture and a slightly hairy underside. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces dry, three-angled fruits. Chenopodium obovatum is often used in traditional medicine and is also a common weed in agricultural settings."
