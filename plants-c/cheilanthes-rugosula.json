    "intro": "Cheilanthes rugosula, commonly known as the rock fern or rough rock fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brown, woolly scales. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and in dry, well-drained soils, demonstrating its adaptability to arid environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Cheilanthes rugosula is a resilient plant that thrives in harsh conditions, making it a common sight in desert and semi-desert regions."
