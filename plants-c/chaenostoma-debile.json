    "intro": "Chaenostoma debile, commonly known as the slender water-milfoil, is a small aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. It produces tiny, floating flowers that are usually white or pale pink in color. Chaenostoma debile plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic insects and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
