    "intro": "Calothyrsus californica, commonly known as the California buckthorn, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, dark berries that provide food for wildlife. The plant has small, oval leaves with a slightly rough texture and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
