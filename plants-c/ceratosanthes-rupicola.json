    "intro": "Ceratosanthes rupicola, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of fragrant, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Ceratosanthes rupicola is an important species for pollinators and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
