    "intro": "Crepidium fasciatum, commonly known as the streaked orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and linear, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, which are often subtended by leaf-like bracts. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
