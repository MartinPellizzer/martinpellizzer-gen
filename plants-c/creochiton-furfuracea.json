    "intro": "Creochiton furfuracea, commonly known as the hairy woodlouse, is a terrestrial isopod belonging to the family Porcellanidae. It is characterized by its segmented, flattened body covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like setae, which provide it with a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. This species is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as under rocks, logs, or leaf litter, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its exoskeleton is composed of chitin and is often covered in a waxy layer that aids in moisture retention. Creochiton furfuracea plays a role in decomposing organic matter and contributing to nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems."
