    "intro": "Cymbopetalum monospermum, commonly known as the flame violet, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to purple. The plant produces small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure."
