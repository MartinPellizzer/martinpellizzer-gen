    "intro": "Cactus stellatus var. texanus, commonly known as the Texas star cactus, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a distinctive star-shaped appearance with sharp, spiny segments that radiate from a central stem. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its desert habitat. This variety is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
