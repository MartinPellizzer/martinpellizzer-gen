    "intro": "Capsella difformis, commonly known as the common mouse-ear or mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that resemble mouse ears, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils. Capsella difformis is an annual plant that completes its life cycle within one growing season."
