    "intro": "Conyza baumii, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is an annual herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture, and it produces small, yellow disk flowers that develop into fluffy, white to brown seeds. Conyza baumii is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain ecosystems. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it a common weed in agricultural and natural areas."
