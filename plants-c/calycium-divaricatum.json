    "intro": "Calycium divaricatum, commonly known as the silver leaf cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing structure and its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it has a distinctive silvery appearance due to its dense covering of fine hairs. Calycium divaricatum is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
