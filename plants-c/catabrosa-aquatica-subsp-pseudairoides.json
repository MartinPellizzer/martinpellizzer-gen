    "intro": "Catabrosa aquatica subsp. pseudairoides, commonly known as the water catabrosa, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands, where it forms dense underwater vegetation. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged, with some emergent foliage near the water's surface. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in spikes, and it produces small, round fruits that float on the water. This subspecies is valued for its role in stabilizing water ecosystems and providing habitat for aquatic life."
