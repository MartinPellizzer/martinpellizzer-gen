    "intro": "Coronilla juncea subsp. ramosissima, commonly known as slender field vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by narrow, bean-like pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
