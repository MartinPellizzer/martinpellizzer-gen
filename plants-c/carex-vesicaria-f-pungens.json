    "intro": "Carex vesicaria f. pungens, commonly known as the spiked bur reed, is a perennial sedge native to wetland environments in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces spikes of small, greenish-brown flowers that develop into cylindrical, spiky seed heads. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective plant for stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
