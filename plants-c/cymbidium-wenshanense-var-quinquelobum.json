    "intro": "Cymbidium wenshanense var. quinquelobum, commonly known as the Wenshan quinquelobum orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting orchid blooms that typically appear in shades of red and orange. The plant features robust pseudobulbs and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in cool, high-altitude environments with high humidity and well-draining soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
