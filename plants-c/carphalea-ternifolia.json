    "intro": "Carphalea ternifolia, commonly known as the three-leaved carphalea, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, trifoliate leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Carphalea ternifolia is valued for its ornamental foliage and its role in supporting local pollinators."
