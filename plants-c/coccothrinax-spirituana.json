    "intro": "Coccothrinax spirituana, commonly known as the Key West palm, is a member of the Arecaceae family and is native to the Florida Keys and the Bahamas. It is a small, slender palm with a single trunk and pinnately compound leaves that are typically bright green. The plant produces small, white flowers that develop into round, red fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to salt spray and sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
