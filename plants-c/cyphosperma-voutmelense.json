    "intro": "Cyphosperma voutmelense, commonly known as the Voutmelense Cyphosperma, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of West Africa. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes trees and shrubs characterized by their often aromatic wood and unique leaf structures. The plant typically features compound leaves with opposite arrangement and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellow in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are often dispersed by wind or animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
