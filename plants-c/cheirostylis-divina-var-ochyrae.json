    "intro": "Cheirostylis divina var. ochyrae, commonly known as the Ochyrae orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fragrant flowers that display a blend of white and pink hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, often arranged in a rosette pattern to maximize light absorption. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
