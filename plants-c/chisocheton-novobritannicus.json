    "intro": "Chisocheton novobritannicus, commonly known as the New Britain chisocheton, is a species of flowering plant native to the rainforests of New Britain, an island in the Solomon Islands. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other tropical hardwoods. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. It produces woody capsules containing several seeds, and it is often found in lowland and montane forest habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its family."
