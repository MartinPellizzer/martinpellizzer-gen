    "intro": "Codivalia lappacea, commonly known as the lappacean bellflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue to white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cold, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Codivalia lappacea is considered a species of conservation concern."
