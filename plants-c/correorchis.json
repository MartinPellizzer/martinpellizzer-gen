    "intro": "Correorchis, commonly known as the fairy orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, often colorful flowers that resemble small, intricate butterflies or insects. They are typically found in temperate regions and thrive in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Correorchis species have specialized roots that absorb nutrients from the soil, and their flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees and flies. The genus includes several species, each with unique floral structures and ecological adaptations."
