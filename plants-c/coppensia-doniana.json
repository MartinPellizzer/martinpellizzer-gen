It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in seasonal environments. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions.
