    "intro": "Coryanthes speciosa, commonly known as the giant coryanthe, is a striking tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, featuring intricate patterns and vibrant colors. The plant has a unique structure with a central column and a modified leaf-like structure called a \"lip\" that attracts pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
