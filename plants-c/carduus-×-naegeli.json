It is characterized by its large, spiny leaves and showy purple or pink flower heads that resemble thistles. The plant is native to Europe but has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It can reach heights of up to 2 meters, making it a striking but sometimes invasive species. Its botanical features include a robust root system and a composite flower structure typical of the daisy family."
