It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, exhibiting drought tolerance. Its yellow flowers resemble those of sunflowers, hence its common name, and it often forms dense, low-growing mats. Cousinia heliantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
