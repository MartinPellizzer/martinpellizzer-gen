    "intro": "Clinostylis, commonly known as the \"butterfly plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their striking, butterfly-like flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, pink, and purple. Clinostylis species are typically shrubs or small trees, native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. They produce capsules as fruits, which contain numerous small, flat seeds. The leaves are usually opposite, ovate, and have a velvety texture, adding to the plant's ornamental appeal."
