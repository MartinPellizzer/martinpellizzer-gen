    "intro": "Carduus rothrockii, commonly known as Rothrock's thistle, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is native to the western United States, particularly found in California and Nevada, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Rothrock's thistle plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its environment."
