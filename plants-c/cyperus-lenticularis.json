    "intro": "Cyperus lenticularis, commonly known as the water wheel plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its cylindrical, often ribbed stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters at the base of the stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in wetland environments. Cyperus lenticularis is often found in marshes, ponds, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
