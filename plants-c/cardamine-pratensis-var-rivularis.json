    "intro": "Cardamine pratensis var. rivularis, commonly known as the water corydalis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, stream banks, and other damp habitats, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of delicate, white or pale pink flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in suitable environments. The species is often found in calcareous soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting insect populations."
