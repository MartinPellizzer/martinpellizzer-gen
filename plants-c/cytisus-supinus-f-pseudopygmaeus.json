    "intro": "Cytisus supinus f. pseudopygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf broom, is a compact, low-growing shrub belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the genus Cytisus. This form is a naturally occurring variant of Cytisus supinus, distinguished by its more compact growth habit and smaller foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal environments. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
