It is characterized by its small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a faintly fragrant aroma. The plant has glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil.
