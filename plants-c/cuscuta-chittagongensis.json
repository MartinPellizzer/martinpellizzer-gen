    "intro": "Cuscuta chittagongensis, commonly known as the Chittagong dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the family Convolvulaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, attaching itself via haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Bangladesh and India. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
