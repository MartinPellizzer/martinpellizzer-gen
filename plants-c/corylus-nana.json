    "intro": "Corylus nana, commonly known as the dwarf hazelnut, is a small deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It produces small, rounded nuts enclosed in a hairy husk, which mature in the fall. The plant has alternate, simple leaves that are oval to elliptical in shape and have a serrated margin. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Corylus nana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its compact size and autumn color."
