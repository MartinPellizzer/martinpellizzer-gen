It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has adapted to the tropical climate with its succulent leaves and salt-tolerant properties. Cyanea larrisonii is an important component of Hawaii's coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various native species. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a significant subject of study in botanical research."
