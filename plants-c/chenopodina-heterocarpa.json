    "intro": "Chenopodina heterocarpa, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual shrub with hairy, succulent stems that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its leaves are typically spine-tipped, providing a defense against herbivores. Chenopodina heterocarpa has a shallow root system that allows it to quickly absorb surface water after rainfall. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing food for desert wildlife."
