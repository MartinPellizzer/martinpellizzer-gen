    "intro": "Cnidoscolus spinosus, commonly known as the spiny huito, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, spiny fruits containing a starchy, tuberous seed. It is often cultivated for its edible parts, though its spines can make handling challenging. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appearance and traditional uses in local cultures."
