    "intro": "Centaurea marginata, commonly known as the coastal centaury, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and spiny, hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, sandy soils, and rocky habitats, showing a high tolerance for salt and wind. Its flowering period occurs from late spring to early autumn, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Centaurea marginata is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and its historical use in traditional medicine."
