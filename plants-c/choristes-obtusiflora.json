    "intro": "Choristes obtusiflora, commonly known as the blunt-flowered choristes, is a species of flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, sandy soils along streambanks and in wetlands. The plant features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive bluish tinge. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Choristes obtusiflora plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
