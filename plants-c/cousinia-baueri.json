    "intro": "Cousinia baueri, commonly known as the Bauer's cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Cousinia baueri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
