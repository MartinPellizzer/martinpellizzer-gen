    "intro": "Carex repanda, commonly known as the broadleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike of small, three-ranked flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Carex repanda is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
