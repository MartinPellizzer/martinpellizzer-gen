    "intro": "Carex divisa subsp. ammophila, commonly known as the sand sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal and sandy environments. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to reddish in color. This subspecies is adapted to well-drained, sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common species in dune ecosystems. It plays a vital role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion. The plant is often found in maritime regions of Europe and North America."
