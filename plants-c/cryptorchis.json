    "intro": "Cryptorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for photosynthesis, making it a unique epiphyte. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on the trunks of trees in wetlands. Due to habitat destruction and its secretive nature, Cryptorchis is considered a critically endangered species."
