    "intro": "Cyperus consocius, commonly known as the swamp spikerush, is a flowering plant belonging to the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like leaves and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes are often submerged, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands. Cyperus consocius plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
