    "intro": "Carex sempervirens var. asiatica, commonly known as Asiatic sedge, is a perennial plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms compact clumps, with narrow, dark green leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces spikes of small, cream-colored flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by cylindrical seed heads. It thrives in moist to wet conditions, making it suitable for wetlands, streambanks, and garden ponds. Asiatic sedge is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
