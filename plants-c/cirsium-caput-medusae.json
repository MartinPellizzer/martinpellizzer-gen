    "intro": "Cirsium caput-medusae, commonly known as the Medusa's Head, is a striking perennial thistle native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, purple to pinkish purple flower heads that resemble a crown. The plant produces a single, showy composite flower made up of numerous small florets, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in stiff, bristly hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Cirsium caput-medusae is often found in dry, sunny grasslands and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
