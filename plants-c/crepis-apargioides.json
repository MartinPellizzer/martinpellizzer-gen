    "intro": "Crepis apargioides, commonly known as the silver hair-grass, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are silver-haired, giving it a distinctive appearance, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Crepis apargioides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
