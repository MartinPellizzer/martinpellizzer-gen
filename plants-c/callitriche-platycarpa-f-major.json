    "intro": "Callitriche platycarpa f. major, commonly known as the broad-fruited water starwort, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It typically grows in shallow water, such as ponds, streams, and wetlands, and has small, floating or submerged leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are usually clustered in a spike-like arrangement. Its fruits are distinctive, being broad and flattened, which aid in seed dispersal. The species is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments."
