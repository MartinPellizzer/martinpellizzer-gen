    "intro": "Carex trisperma f. billingsii, commonly known as the Billings sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various organisms. The leaves are generally narrow, linear, and have a distinctive blue-green hue, contributing to its ornamental value in wetland gardens."
