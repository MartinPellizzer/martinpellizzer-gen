    "intro": "Crassina linearis, commonly known as the linear sea grass, is a marine flowering plant found in shallow coastal waters. It has long, narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are adapted to withstand strong water currents. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by wind or water. Crassina linearis plays an important role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for marine life. Its distribution is largely restricted to temperate regions along the Atlantic coast."
