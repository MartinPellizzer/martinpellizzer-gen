    "intro": "Calystegia subvolubilis, commonly known as the morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It produces trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, often colorful blooms in shades of purple, pink, and white. Its rapid growth habit makes it a common weed in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to twine around supporting structures."
