    "intro": "Chiapasia nelsonii, commonly known as the Nelson's chiapasia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks of trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a smooth, waxy surface, while its flowers display vibrant colors ranging from pink to red. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Chiapasia nelsonii is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
