    "intro": "Calophyllum rubiginosum, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its thick, corky bark that helps it withstand saltwater and tidal forces. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Its pneumatophores, or breathing roots, allow it to absorb oxygen from the air in waterlogged soils. This species plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting diverse marine and terrestrial ecosystems."
