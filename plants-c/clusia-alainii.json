    "intro": "Clusia alainii, commonly known as the Alain's glorybower, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the Lesser Antilles. It belongs to the Clusiaceae family, also known as the guttiferae family, and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are thick, waxy, and often have a glossy appearance, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, tropical habitat. Clusia alainii is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in warm climates."
