    "intro": "Coelogyne sulawesiensis, commonly known as the Sulawesi orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia. It features a pseudobulb that supports its growth and produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive yellow and green coloration. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are often fragrant and bloom during the wet season, making it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is sometimes cultivated in conservation programs."
