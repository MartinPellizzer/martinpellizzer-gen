    "intro": "Calanthe raishaensis, commonly known as the Raisha orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, lance-shaped leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its flowers, which bloom in spring, are usually white or pale pink with a distinctive lip. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
