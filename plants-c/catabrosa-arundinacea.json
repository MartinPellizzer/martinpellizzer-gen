    "intro": "Catabrosa arundinacea, commonly known as the sweet flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy areas in Asia and Europe. It features long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are typically borne on slender stalks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, capable of storing nutrients and enabling vegetative propagation. Catabrosa arundinacea is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent."
