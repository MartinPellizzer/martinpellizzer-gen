    "intro": "Commiphora arenaria, commonly known as the desert myrrh, is a small shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces a resinous sap that has been traditionally used for medicinal and aromatic purposes. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited rainfall. Its ecological role includes providing shelter and food for various desert wildlife."
