    "intro": "Colchicum chalcedonicum, commonly known as the Chalcedony Colchic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It produces striking violet to purple flowers with a distinctive, spurred shape, typically blooming in late summer. The plant features a robust, fleshy corm that serves as its storage organ, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are basal, broad, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
