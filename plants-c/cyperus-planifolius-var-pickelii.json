    "intro": "Cyperus planifolius var. pickelii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Australia. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually narrow and flat, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its flowering stems are often shorter than the leaves and bear small, inconspicuous spikes of pale brown or greenish flowers. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
