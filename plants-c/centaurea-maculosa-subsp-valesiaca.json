    "intro": "Centaurea maculosa subsp. valesiaca, commonly known as the spotted knapweed, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking purple to pink flowers and serrated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a taproot system and produces numerous small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems."
