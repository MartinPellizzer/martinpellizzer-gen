    "intro": "Chondrocarpus triflorus, commonly known as the three-flowered spikerush, is a perennial sedge native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, three-flowered spikes that are typically green or brown in color. The plant thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils. Its rhizomes form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Chondrocarpus triflorus plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity and maintaining wetland habitats."
