    "intro": "Calyptranthes yaquensis, commonly known as the Yaqu\u00e9n snowberry, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Peru. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its small, berry-like fruits are edible and serve as a food source for various wildlife. Due to habitat loss, Calyptranthes yaquensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
