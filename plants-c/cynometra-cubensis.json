    "intro": "Cynometra cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban ironwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and parts of the Bahamas. It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The tree has simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in panicles, while the fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cynometra cubensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
