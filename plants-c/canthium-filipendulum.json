    "intro": "Canthium filipendulum, commonly known as the slender spurge, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often pubescent. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia, a typical feature of the spurge family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Canthium filipendulum is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested."
