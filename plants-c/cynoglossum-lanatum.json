    "intro": "Cynoglossum lanatum, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, woolly stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically violet or blue in color, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky habitats. Cynoglossum lanatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
