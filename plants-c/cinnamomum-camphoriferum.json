    "intro": "Cinnamomum camphoriferum, commonly known as the Chinese camphor tree, is a deciduous tree native to southern China and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, camphor-containing wood, which has been historically valued for its medicinal and commercial uses. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark purple berries containing winged seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a distinctive, slightly serrated margin. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland forests."
