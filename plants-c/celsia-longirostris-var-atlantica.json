    "intro": "Celsia longirostris var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic celsia, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic coast. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and requires ample sunlight. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and moderate coastal winds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
