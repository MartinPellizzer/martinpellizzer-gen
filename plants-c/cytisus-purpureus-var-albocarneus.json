    "intro": "Cytisus purpureus var. albocarneus, commonly known as the white-flowered broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe. It features slender, woody stems and is characterized by its clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and rocky habitats. This variety is less common than the typical Cytisus purpureus and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
