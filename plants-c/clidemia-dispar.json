It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with showy flowers. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. Clidemia dispar produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecosystems where it thrives."
