    "intro": "Carex latisquamea, commonly known as the broad-scaled sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces cylindrical spikelets that bear small, inconspicuous flowers, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Carex latisquamea is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
