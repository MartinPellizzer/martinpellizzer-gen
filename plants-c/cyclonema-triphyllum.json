    "intro": "Cyclonema triphyllum, commonly known as the three-leaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swamps. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, violet-blue flowers in clusters. Its berries, which are toxic to humans and animals, are often mistaken for edible fruits. Cyclonema triphyllum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for certain wildlife species."
