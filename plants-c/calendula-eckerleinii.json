    "intro": "Calendula eckerleinii, commonly known as the Eckerlein's marigold, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Asteraceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers with radiating petals, typical of the calendula genus. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare species with limited horticultural use."
