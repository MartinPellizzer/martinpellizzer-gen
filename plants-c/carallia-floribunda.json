    "intro": "Carallia floribunda, commonly known as the red-flowered beautyberry, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces striking clusters of bright red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native gardens. The leaves are elliptical with a slightly serrated edge and turn reddish in the autumn."
