    "intro": "Cerastium pumilum var. divaricatum, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial herb native to Europe. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. The flowers are white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems, and bloom in early spring. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its delicate structure and ability to spread via runners make it a common sight in moist, temperate regions."
