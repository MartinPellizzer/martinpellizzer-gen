    "intro": "Chromolaena myriocephala, commonly known as the spreading crownleaf, is a shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinct, slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as roadsides and clearings. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
