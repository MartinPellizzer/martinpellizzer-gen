    "intro": "Cyrtochilum costatum, commonly known as the wavy-lip orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, wavy-lip petals that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Cyrtochilum costatum produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, which bloom during the warmer months. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil, making it well-suited to its natural habitat."
