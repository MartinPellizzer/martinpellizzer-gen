    "intro": "Calea pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved calea, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a distinct, waxy appearance. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
