    "intro": "Cyclanthera trigonoloba var. caudata, commonly known as the long-tailed bitter melon, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces elongated, green fruits that turn orange when ripe, often with a distinctive tail-like appendage at the base. The flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in racemes, typical of the Cucurbitaceae family. It is valued for its edible fruits, though they are known for their bitter taste and are often used in traditional cuisines."
