    "intro": "Chorizema varium var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf chorizema, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with compact, rosette-forming leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or rocky habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
