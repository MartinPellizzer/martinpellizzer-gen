    "intro": "Cassine affinis, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to reveal three winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Cassine affinis is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils."
