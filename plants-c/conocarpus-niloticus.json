    "intro": "Conocarpus niloticus, commonly known as the African mangrove, is a tropical tree species native to the coastal regions of Africa. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in saline and brackish water environments, making it a key component of mangrove ecosystems. The plant has a robust root system that helps stabilize shorelines and prevent erosion. Its leaves are typically alternate and ovate, with a waxy surface that reduces water loss. Conocarpus niloticus also plays a vital role in providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
