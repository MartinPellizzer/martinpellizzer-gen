    "intro": "Carex alterniflora var. aureobrunnea, commonly known as the golden brown sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green with a distinctive golden-brown hue along the edges. The plant produces spikes of small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in a loose, cylindrical shape. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshes, pond margins, and along streams. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
