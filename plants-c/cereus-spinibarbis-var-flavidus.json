It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are covered in sharp, spiny ridges. The plant produces large, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming at night. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to survive. Due to its striking appearance and unique adaptations, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and cactus collections."
