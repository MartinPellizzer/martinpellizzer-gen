    "intro": "Coryphantha neovivipara var. arizonica, commonly known as the Arizona live-bearing cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green and covered in white to yellow spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted foliage. It is a succulent, meaning it stores water in its stems to survive in arid environments. This variety is particularly noted for its viviparous reproduction, where seeds are produced on the plant's surface and can germinate before falling to the ground."
