    "intro": "Cryptantha dimorpha, commonly known as the two-form cryptantha, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the western United States, particularly found in California and Nevada, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, and its leaves are typically trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets. Cryptantha dimorpha is a perennial herb that produces distinctive, two-lobed seed pods, which contribute to its common name. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in chaparral and sagebrush ecosystems."
