    "intro": "Cynodon sudeticus, commonly known as the Sudetic buffalo grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and dense, fine-textured foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Cynodon sudeticus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
