It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed areas. Its leaves are covered in dense, sharp prickles, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The species is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other thistle and daisy species."
