    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 lebaudyanum, commonly known as the hybrid white lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is a hybrid between Cypripedium micranthum and Cypripedium yunnanense, exhibiting a unique combination of floral characteristics from both parents. The plant produces large, showy flowers with a white pouch-like lip and greenish-yellow petals, often adorned with purple veins. It thrives in cool, shaded environments with moist, well-drained soil, typically found in forested areas. Due to its rarity and aesthetic appeal, it is highly valued in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
