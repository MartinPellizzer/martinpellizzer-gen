    "intro": "Carex fissuricola, commonly known as the fissured sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-white flowers in the summer. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and colonize new areas. Carex fissuricola is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
