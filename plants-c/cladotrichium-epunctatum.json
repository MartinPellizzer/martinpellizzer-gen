    "intro": "Cladotrichium epunctatum, commonly known as the punctate leaf mallow, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, often appearing in the axils of the leaves. Its root system is fibrous, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Cladotrichium epunctatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
