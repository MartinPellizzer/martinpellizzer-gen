    "intro": "Cestrum cahosianum, commonly known as the Chagos nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Chagos Archipelago in the Indian Ocean. It is characterized by its striking, tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has simple, ovate leaves and produces small, orange-red berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to salt spray and sandy soils. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
