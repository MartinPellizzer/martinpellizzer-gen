    "intro": "Cyperus cymbiformis, commonly known as the flatleaf flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a dense cluster of small, spike-like inflorescences at the base. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Cyperus cymbiformis thrives in wet or moist environments, making it a common sight in marshy areas and along water bodies."
