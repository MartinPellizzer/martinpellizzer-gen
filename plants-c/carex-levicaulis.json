    "intro": "Carex levicaulis, commonly known as the slender flat-sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, typical of many sedges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems. Carex levicaulis is often found in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian habitats."
