    "intro": "Cassia maritima, commonly known as sea cassia, is a tropical shrub native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces bright yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom from summer to fall. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Cassia maritima is often found in sandy or saline soils, adapting well to coastal environments."
