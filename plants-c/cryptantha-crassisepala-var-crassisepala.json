It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant taxonomy."
