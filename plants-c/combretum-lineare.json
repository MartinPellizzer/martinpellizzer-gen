    "intro": "Combretum lineare, commonly known as the linear combretum, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in savannas and woodland areas. The bark and leaves of Combretum lineare have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and astringent properties."
