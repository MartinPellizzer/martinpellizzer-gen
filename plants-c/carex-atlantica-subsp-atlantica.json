    "intro": "Carex atlantica subsp. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear brownish to greenish flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tidal marshes and along the edges of freshwater wetlands. It has a robust rhizomatous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its ability to tolerate salt spray and fluctuating water levels."
