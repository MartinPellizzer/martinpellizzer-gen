    "intro": "Calycosia lageniformis, commonly known as the bottlebrush cupplant, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, bottle-shaped bracts that enclose the small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Calycosia lageniformis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
