    "intro": "Convallaria majalis var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved lily of the valley, is a variant of the lily of the valley plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a toxic cardiac glycoside called convallatoxin, which makes it potentially harmful if ingested. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its ornamental value is appreciated in gardens, though care must be taken due to its poisonous nature."
