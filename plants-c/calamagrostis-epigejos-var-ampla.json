    "intro": "Calamagrostis epigejos var. ampla, commonly known as the giant switchgrass, is a tall, perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often gray-green in color. The plant produces panicles of small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for erosion control and wildlife habitat. Its ornamental value comes from its striking fall color and ability to form dense clumps."
