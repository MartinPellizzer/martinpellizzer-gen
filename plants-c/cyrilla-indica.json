    "intro": "Cyrilla indica, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It has glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. Cyrilla indica thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
