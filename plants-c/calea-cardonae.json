    "intro": "Calea cardonae, commonly known as the sacred candle plant, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, candle-like inflorescence composed of bright yellow tubular flowers that bloom at night. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy species adapted to desert environments. Its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit make it a popular choice for xeriscaping. The plant's ability to store water in its thick stems and leaves further enhances its resilience in dry climates."
