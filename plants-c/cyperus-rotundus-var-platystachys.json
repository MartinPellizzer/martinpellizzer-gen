    "intro": "Cyperus rotundus var. platystachys, commonly known as marsh flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower spikes that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive. The species is characterized by its ability to tolerate a wide range of soil conditions and water levels."
