    "intro": "Catapodium rigidum var. multiflorum, commonly known as the clustered catapodium, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright, rigid stems that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which are typically green to reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue due to a waxy coating. This species is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as scrublands and coastal areas."
