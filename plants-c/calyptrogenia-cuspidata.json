    "intro": "Calyptrogenia cuspidata, commonly known as the hooded lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in cool, moist environments. It is characterized by its distinctive, leaf-like thallus with a dense, leathery upper surface and a more delicate, filamentous lower layer. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, with the fungal component providing structure and the algal component contributing to photosynthesis. It is typically found on bark, rocks, or soil in temperate regions. Calyptrogenia cuspidata is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants."
