    "intro": "Colletia articulata, commonly known as the jointed candelabra cactus, is a succulent plant native to South America. It is characterized by its branching, cylindrical stems that are often segmented and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its unique structure and adaptability make it a popular choice for desert gardens and cactus collections."
