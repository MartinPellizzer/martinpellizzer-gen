    "intro": "Connarus pickeringii, commonly known as the Pickering's connarus, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a small, evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows in dense, shaded undergrowth. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often green or yellowish, and it produces small, fleshy berries as its fruit. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Connarus pickeringii is highly vulnerable to extinction."
