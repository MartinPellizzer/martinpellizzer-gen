    "intro": "Convolvulus subacaulis, commonly known as the slender bindweed, is a herbaceous annual plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Convolvulus subacaulis is adapted to arid conditions, making it a common weed in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
