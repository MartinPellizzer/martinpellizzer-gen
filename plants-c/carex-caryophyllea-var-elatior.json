    "intro": "Carex caryophyllea var. elatior, commonly known as the tall spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces tall, cylindrical spikes of small, pale green to brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variety is distinguished by its taller stature compared to other Carex species, making it a notable feature in wetland ecosystems."
