It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a contrasting lip. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and its leaves are strap-like and arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting mix for optimal growth.
