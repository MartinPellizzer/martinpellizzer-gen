    "intro": "Cyclosorus rigidus, commonly known as the rigid water clover, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It is characterized by its dense, floating mats of narrow, ribbon-like leaves that form a dense cover on the water surface. The plant lacks true roots and instead has rhizoids that anchor it to submerged substrates. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters near the water's surface. Cyclosorus rigidus is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, contributing to water clarity by reducing algal growth."
