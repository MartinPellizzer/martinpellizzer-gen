    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 amblycarpa, commonly known as the rough lemon, is a hybrid citrus plant originating from a cross between the citron (Citrus medica) and the lemon (Citrus limon). It is characterized by its thick, rough, and often fissured rind, which is a distinguishing feature from other citrus species. The plant is typically shrub-like or small tree, with dark green, oval-shaped leaves and fragrant white flowers. Its fruit is generally small, green, and less juicy compared to other citrus fruits, with a high concentration of citric acid. It is primarily grown for its ornamental value and as a source of citronella oil, which is used in perfumes and as a natural insect repellent."
