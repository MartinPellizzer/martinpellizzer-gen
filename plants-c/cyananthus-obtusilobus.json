    "intro": "Cyananthus obtusilobus, commonly known as the blunt-lobed bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Cyananthus obtusilobus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, colorful blooms."
