    "intro": "Catasetum \u00d7 splendens var. imperiale, commonly known as the imperial orchid, is a hybrid orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature vibrant red or orange hues with contrasting white or yellow markings. The plant produces specialized pollination structures called \"trigger hairs\" that respond to the touch of certain pollinators, such as bees. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light and well-draining soil. Its botanical significance lies in its role in horticultural breeding and its unique adaptations for pollination."
