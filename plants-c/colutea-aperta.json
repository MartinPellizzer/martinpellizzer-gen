    "intro": "Colutea aperta, commonly known as the broadleaf cowpea or the yellow larkspur, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, yellow flowers. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and waste grounds. Colutea aperta is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
