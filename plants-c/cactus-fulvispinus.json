    "intro": "Cactus fulvispinus, commonly known as the golden spiny cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual element to its desert habitat. Its spines, which are often yellow or orange in color, serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Cactus fulvispinus is also adapted to tolerate extreme temperatures and can thrive in well-drained sandy or rocky soils."
