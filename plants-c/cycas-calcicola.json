    "intro": "Cycas calcicola, commonly known as the limestone cycad, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils, which are typical of its natural habitat. Its reproductive structures include a large, spiky male cone and a smaller, multi-seeded female cone. Cycas calcicola is a slow-growing, long-lived plant that plays a significant role in its ecosystem."
