    "intro": "Convolvulus alsinoides, commonly known as the common morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is a herbaceous annual that produces trumpet-shaped flowers, typically in shades of pink, purple, or white. The plant has tendrils that help it climb and twine around supports, giving it a vine-like growth habit. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. The flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name."
