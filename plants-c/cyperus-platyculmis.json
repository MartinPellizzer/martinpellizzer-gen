It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in wetland and marshy environments. The plant produces tiny, three-petaled flowers that are typically green or brown in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in suitable habitats."
