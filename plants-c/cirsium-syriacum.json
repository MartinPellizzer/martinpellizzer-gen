    "intro": "Cirsium syriacum, commonly known as the Syrian thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of 60\u2013120 cm and features rough, spiny leaves with a silvery underside. The plant produces purple to pink flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Cirsium syriacum is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, such as grasslands and woodland edges."
