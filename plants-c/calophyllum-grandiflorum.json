    "intro": "Calophyllum grandiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered calophyllum, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, glossy green leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The tree is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some traditional uses in local cultures."
