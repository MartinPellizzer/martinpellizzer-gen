    "intro": "Cystopus pectinifer, commonly known as the featherleaf lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its foliose growth form, with a thallus that is typically greenish to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga, and a fungal partner from the Ascomycota division. It is often found on tree bark and rocks in temperate forest environments. Cystopus pectinifer is notable for its distinctive, feathery lobes that give it its common name."
