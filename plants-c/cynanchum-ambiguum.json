    "intro": "Cynanchum ambiguum, commonly known as the ambiguous milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its slender stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its fruit is a follicle containing toxic seeds. Cynanchum ambiguum is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by livestock and wildlife."
