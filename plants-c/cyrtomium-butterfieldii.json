    "intro": "Cyrtomium butterfieldii, commonly known as the Butterfield's holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, upright form. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups known as sorus. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Cyrtomium butterfieldii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
