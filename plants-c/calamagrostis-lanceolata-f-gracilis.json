    "intro": "Calamagrostis lanceolata f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender silvergrass, is a compact, ornamental grass that features narrow, silver-blue foliage. It is a frost-tolerant perennial that thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces delicate, feathery plumes in late summer, adding a soft, ethereal texture to the landscape. Its upright growth habit makes it ideal for rock gardens, borders, or as a ground cover. It is valued for its low maintenance and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
