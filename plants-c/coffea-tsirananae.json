    "intro": "Coffea tsirananae, commonly known as the Madagascar coffee, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Madagascar. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows in the humid, shaded understory of tropical rainforests. The plant produces small, oval-shaped red berries that contain two seeds, which are used to make coffee. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and has a unique genetic makeup that distinguishes it from other coffee species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a critically endangered plant."
