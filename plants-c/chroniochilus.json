    "intro": "Chroniochilus, commonly known as the sacred orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plants typically have small, delicate flowers with intricate patterns, often featuring a prominent lip that serves as a landing platform for pollinators. They are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, and require well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to their rarity and beauty, Chroniochilus species are highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and conservationists alike."
