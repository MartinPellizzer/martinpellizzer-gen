    "intro": "Caroxylon melananthum, commonly known as the black-flowered sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish to reddish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Caroxylon melananthum is well-suited to sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities."
