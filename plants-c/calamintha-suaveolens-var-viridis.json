    "intro": "Calamintha suaveolens var. viridis, commonly known as green lemon balm, is a variant of the lemon balm species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with aromatic, slightly fuzzy leaves that emit a fresh, citrus-like scent. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often used in herbal teas and aromatherapy for its calming properties. The variety 'viridis' is distinguished by its more vibrant green leaf color compared to the standard lemon balm."
