    "intro": "Chlorophytum engleri var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spider plant, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to Southeast Asia. It features long, arching leaves that are narrow and often have a slightly wavy edge, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers on slender stalks, which are followed by bright blue or purple berries. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance of low light and minimal water requirements. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for hanging baskets and as a decorative houseplant."
