    "intro": "Castilleja mearnsii, commonly known as Mearns' paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes hemiparasitic plants that derive some nutrients from their host species. The plant is characterized by its showy, red to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are scale-like and often hidden beneath the stems, while its roots form connections with the roots of neighboring plants. Castilleja mearnsii is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges."
