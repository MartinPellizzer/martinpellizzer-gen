    "intro": "Carex pilosa var. auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often adorned with distinctive auriculate (ear-like) projections at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a popular choice for wetland restoration and native plant gardens."
