    "intro": "Calceolaria hastata, commonly known as the spurred calceolaria, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its unique, spurred calyx that resembles a small pouch, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine conditions. Its flowers are usually violet or purple in color, and they bloom during the cooler months. Calceolaria hastata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
