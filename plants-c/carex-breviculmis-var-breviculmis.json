    "intro": "Carex breviculmis var. breviculmis, commonly known as the short-bracted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to brown in color, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
