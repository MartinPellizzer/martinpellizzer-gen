    "intro": "Caraguata bracteosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Brazilian velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Caraguata bracteosa is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in warm, humid climates. It is often found in disturbed areas and along riverbanks, where it can spread rapidly due to its prolific seed production."
