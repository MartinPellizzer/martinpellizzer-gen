    "intro": "Cicca pentandra, commonly known as the five-angled cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its slow growth and long lifespan make it a symbol of resilience in its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, Cicca pentandra is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
