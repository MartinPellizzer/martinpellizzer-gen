    "intro": "Calorhabdos venosa, commonly known as the veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, veined leaves that are often a deep green with contrasting markings. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically during the wet season. Calorhabdos venosa is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both ornamental and horticultural purposes."
