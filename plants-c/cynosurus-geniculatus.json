    "intro": "Cynosurus geniculatus, commonly known as the bent grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often curved stems and small, narrow leaves that form dense, low-growing mats. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stems, and its flowers are typically wind-pollinated. Cynosurus geniculatus thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
