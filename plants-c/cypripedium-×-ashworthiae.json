    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 ashworthiae, commonly known as the Ashworth's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate light without being exposed to direct sunlight. Its flowers are usually pink or white with a yellow or orange lip, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. This orchid is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts due to its rarity and unique appearance."
