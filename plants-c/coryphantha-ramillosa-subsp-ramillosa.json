    "intro": "Coryphantha ramillosa subsp. ramillosa, commonly known as the ramillowsa cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a globular or cylindrical stem that is typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces showy yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It has a shallow root system and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it drought-tolerant."
