    "intro": "Carex pensylvanica var. livoniensis, commonly known as the Livonia sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This variety is typically found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in late spring to early summer, which are often surrounded by bracts. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective plant for erosion control and wetland restoration projects."
