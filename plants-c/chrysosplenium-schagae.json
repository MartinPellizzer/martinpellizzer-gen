    "intro": "Chrysosplenium schagae, commonly known as the Schagae's golden spleenwort, is a member of the Saxifragaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant's leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces spores rather than seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
