    "intro": "Cyperus eglobosus, commonly known as the globular flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond edges, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Cyperus eglobosus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability to various aquatic conditions."
