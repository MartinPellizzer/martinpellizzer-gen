    "intro": "Cienfuegosia somaliana, commonly known as the Somali cienfuegosia, is a rare flowering plant native to the dry, arid regions of Somalia. It belongs to the family Ctenolophonaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments with deep root systems and thick, waxy leaves to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change."
