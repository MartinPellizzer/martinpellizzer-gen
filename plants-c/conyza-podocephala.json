    "intro": "Conyza podocephala, commonly known as the white cocklebur, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its prickly, spiny leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces numerous seeds enclosed in a spiny, spherical fruit called a schizocarp. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas. Conyza podocephala is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
