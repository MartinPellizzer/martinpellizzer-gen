    "intro": "Calamus cawa, commonly known as the sweet flag, is a perennial wetland plant native to Asia and parts of North America. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in marshy or wet soil, often near water bodies, and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. The plant's distinctive fragrance is due to the presence of volatile oils in its leaves and stems."
