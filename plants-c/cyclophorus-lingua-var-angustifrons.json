    "intro": "Cyclophorus lingua var. angustifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cyclophorus, is a species of flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
