    "intro": "Campanula prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features creeping stems that often lie close to the ground, forming a dense mat of foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically oval or lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Campanula prostrata is well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
