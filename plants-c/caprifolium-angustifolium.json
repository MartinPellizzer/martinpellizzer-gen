    "intro": "Caprifolium angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, arching stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or yellow, which give way to red, fleshy berries in the autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. Its berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife."
