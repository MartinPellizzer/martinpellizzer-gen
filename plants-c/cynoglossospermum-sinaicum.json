It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
