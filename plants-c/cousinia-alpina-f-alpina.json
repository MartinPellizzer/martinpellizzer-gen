    "intro": "Cousinia alpina f. alpina, commonly known as the alpine cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with silver-gray foliage and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in dry, rocky, and alpine environments, often found at high altitudes. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for harsh, arid conditions. The inflorescence consists of dense clusters of bracteate flowers, which are adapted for pollination by wind and insects."
