    "intro": "Commiphora somalensis, commonly known as Somali myrrh, is a small, deciduous shrub native to the dry regions of Somalia and neighboring parts of East Africa. It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes frankincense and myrrh-producing species. The plant is characterized by its aromatic resinous sap, which is harvested to produce a fragrant gum used in traditional medicine and incense. Its leaves are elliptic and glossy, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects. Commiphora somalensis thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils and in coastal areas."
