It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands. This form is particularly adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient and hardy plant."
