    "intro": "Cajanus indicus, commonly known as pigeon pea, is an annual leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant is well adapted to warm climates and is often cultivated for its high protein content in its seeds. Cajanus indicus has a deep root system that helps it thrive in poor soils and is drought-tolerant. It also plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility."
