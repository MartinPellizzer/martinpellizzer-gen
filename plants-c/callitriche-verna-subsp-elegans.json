    "intro": "Callitriche verna subsp. elegans, commonly known as the spring water-starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant native to Europe. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often in ponds, ditches, and stream margins. The plant features tiny, star-shaped white flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, floating or submerged, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is an important part of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
