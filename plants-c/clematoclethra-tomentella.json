    "intro": "Clematoclethra tomentella, commonly known as the woolly clematoclethra, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft-textured appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
