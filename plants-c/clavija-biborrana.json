    "intro": "Clavija biborrana, commonly known as the red-barked willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking red-brown bark, which peels in thin layers to reveal a lighter inner layer. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Clavija biborrana is often used in ornamental gardening for its unique bark and seasonal interest."
