    "intro": "Cybianthus morii, commonly known as the Morii's candleflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is a flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae, characterized by its tall, candle-like stems and showy yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its coastal habitat. Cybianthus morii is known for its seasonal blooming, typically occurring in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
