    "intro": "Cephalophora litoralis, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Atlantic. It is characterized by its striking, spiky blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its salty, windy habitat. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found growing along the shorelines. Cephalophora litoralis is well adapted to coastal conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species."
