    "intro": "Cydonia vulgaris var. marmorata, commonly known as the marbled peach, is a cultivated variety of the peach tree characterized by its distinctive marbled or mottled skin. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to Asia, particularly China. The plant produces sweet, juicy fruits with a tender flesh and a mild, aromatic flavor. It is typically grown in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth. The marbled appearance of its fruit is due to unique pigmentation patterns in the skin."
