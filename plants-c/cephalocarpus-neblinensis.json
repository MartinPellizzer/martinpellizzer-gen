    "intro": "Cephalocarpus neblinensis, commonly known as the misty-headed plant, is a unique species native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, helmet-shaped fruiting bodies that give it its scientific name. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with dense foliage, often forming a low shrub. Its leaves are typically small,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, high-altitude habitat. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unusual morphology and potential ecological role in its ecosystem."
