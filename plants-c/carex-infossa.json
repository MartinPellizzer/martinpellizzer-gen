    "intro": "Carex infossa, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Carex infossa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in wet environments."
