    "intro": "Carex tomentosa f. grasmanniana, commonly known as the Grasmanian sedge, is a variant of the common sedge, characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and pond edges, and prefers partial to full shade. The plant features narrow, cylindrical leaves that are covered in a fine, woolly layer of hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is valued in ecological landscaping for its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
