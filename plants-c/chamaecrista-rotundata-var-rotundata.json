It is characterized by its small, yellow, pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces distinctive, spiny seed pods that contain small, hard seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its growth habit makes it both a weed and a potential forage plant in certain environments."
