    "intro": "Cynanchica suberosa, commonly known as the woody milkweed, is a perennial plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and milky sap, which are typical features of the Asclepiadaceae family. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture. Cynanchica suberosa is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
