    "intro": "Chromolaena leptocephala, commonly known as the stinging nettle tree, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds with tufts of silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Its stems and leaves contain irritant chemicals, similar to those found in stinging nettle, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. This species is often found in disturbed habitats and is sometimes considered an invasive plant in certain regions."
