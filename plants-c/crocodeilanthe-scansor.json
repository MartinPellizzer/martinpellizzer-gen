    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe scansor, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, creeping rhizomes that allow it to climb and attach to trees or other structures. The plant produces small, clustered fronds with a distinctive, serrated edge. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. Crocodeilanthe scansor thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests."
