    "intro": "Celmisia rotundifolia, commonly known as the rounded-leaved celmisia, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and hairy, rounded leaves. The plant produces daisy-like flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which bloom in spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
