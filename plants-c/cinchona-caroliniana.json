    "intro": "Cinchona caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina quinine tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in the Carolinas and parts of Florida. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a capsule that contains seeds, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments. The tree has historical significance due to its use in the production of quinine, though it is not as widely cultivated as other cinchona species."
