    "intro": "Cyperus macropus, commonly known as the broad-leaved flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are broad and flat, with a distinctive blue-green color, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are often inconspicuous. Cyperus macropus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
