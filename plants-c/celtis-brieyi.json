    "intro": "Celtis brieyi, commonly known as the Mexican hackberry, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to parts of Central America and northern South America. It belongs to the Elaeocarpaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, round berries that are edible for some wildlife but not typically consumed by humans. Celtis brieyi is often found in moist, well-drained soils in lowland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
