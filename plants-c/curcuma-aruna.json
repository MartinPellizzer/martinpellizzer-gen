    "intro": "Curcuma aruna, commonly known as the red ginger or Aruna turmeric, is a rhizomatous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family and is characterized by its ornamental foliage and striking orange-red flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white and green. Its rhizomes, while not as widely used as those of turmeric, contain compounds with potential medicinal properties. Curcuma aruna is valued both for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and for its traditional uses in herbal medicine."
