It is a succulent species characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Calandrinia involucrata is often found in disturbed soils and can be a common weed in agricultural areas."
