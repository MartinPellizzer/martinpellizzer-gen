    "intro": "Camissonia claviformis subsp. yumae, commonly known as the Yuma's keyleaf scale, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the Sonoran Desert of the United States and Mexico. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are tightly clustered around a central stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to their lack of showy petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
