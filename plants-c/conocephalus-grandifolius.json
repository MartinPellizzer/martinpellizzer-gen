    "intro": "Conocephalus grandifolius, commonly known as the large-leaf conocephalus, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking, fragrant flowers with a complex structure typical of the Orchidaceae family. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing epiphytically on trees or rocks. Its flowering period typically occurs during the wet season, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
