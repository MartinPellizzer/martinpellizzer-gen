    "intro": "Cynorkis sigmoidea, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family native to the tropical regions of Africa. This terrestrial orchid is characterized by its distinctive zigzag-shaped leaves, which give it its common name. It produces small, delicate flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with purple markings, often blooming during the rainy season. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and conservation efforts."
