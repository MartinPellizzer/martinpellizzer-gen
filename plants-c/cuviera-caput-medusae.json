    "intro": "Cuviera caput-medusae, commonly known as the crown-of-thorns, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features a short, thick stem with numerous fleshy, spiny branches that resemble a crown. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in hot climates. Cuviera caput-medusae is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
