    "intro": "Cerastium uniflorum, commonly known as the one-flowered mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with hairy, succulent stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Cerastium uniflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in garden settings for its delicate appearance."
