It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
