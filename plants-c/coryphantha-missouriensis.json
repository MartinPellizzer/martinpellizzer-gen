    "intro": "Coryphantha missouriensis, commonly known as the Missouri prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the central United States. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in spiny areoles, which bear clusters of white, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Coryphantha missouriensis plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and birds, by providing nectar and shelter."
