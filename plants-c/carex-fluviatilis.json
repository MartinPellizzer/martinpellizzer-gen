    "intro": "Carex fluviatilis, commonly known as the river sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, featuring grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, stabilizing riverbanks and preventing erosion. Carex fluviatilis plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
