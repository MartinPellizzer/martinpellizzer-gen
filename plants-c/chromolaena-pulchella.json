    "intro": "Chromolaena pulchella, commonly known as the purple false hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in clusters. Chromolaena pulchella is known for its rapid growth and is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and forest edges."
