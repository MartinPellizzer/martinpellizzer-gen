    "intro": "Caraipa melhemiana, commonly known as the Melhem's caraipa, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the family Cactaceae, which includes many cactus species, though it is not a true cactus. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, brightly colored flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its succulent leaves and deep root system. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
