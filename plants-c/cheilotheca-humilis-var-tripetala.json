    "intro": "Cheilotheca humilis var. tripetala, commonly known as the three-lobed cheilotheca, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tiny, white to pale yellow florets arranged in compact clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland habitats, where it contributes to the local biodiversity. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
