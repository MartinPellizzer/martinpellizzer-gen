    "intro": "Calanthe baconii, commonly known as the bacon's calanthe, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its elegant, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Calanthe baconii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
