    "intro": "Corallorhiza leimbachiana, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is a mycoheterotroph, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients. The plant produces small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late summer, often in shaded, moist woodlands. Its roots are specialized to form symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, which provide essential carbohydrates. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation efforts."
