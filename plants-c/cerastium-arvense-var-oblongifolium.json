    "intro": "Cerastium arvense var. oblongifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, woolly leaves that are elliptical in shape, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, rounded fruits. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
