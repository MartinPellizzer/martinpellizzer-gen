    "intro": "Castilleja pallida, commonly known as the pale Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, reddish-orange inflorescences that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its host plants for nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Castilleja pallida plays a role in supporting pollinators and is often found in association with native grasses and forbs."
