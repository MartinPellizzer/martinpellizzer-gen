    "intro": "Cephalanthera conferta, commonly known as the clustered lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and its distinctive inflorescence of small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in a loose spiral. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It produces a single, fleshy, yellowish rootstock and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Cephalanthera conferta is a perennial species that blooms in late spring to early summer."
