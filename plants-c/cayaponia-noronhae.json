    "intro": "Cayaponia noronhae, commonly known as the Brazilian nightshade, is a climbing shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and tobacco. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom at night. Its fruits are edible and have a mild, sweet taste, though they contain solanine, a toxic alkaloid. Due to habitat loss, Cayaponia noronhae is considered endangered and is of interest for conservation and botanical research."
