    "intro": "Cylindropuntia whipplei subsp. whipplei, commonly known as the whipplei cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, segmented stems that are covered in clusters of small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its adaptations include succulent stems for water storage and spines for protection against herbivores. This species is well-suited to arid environments and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats."
