    "intro": "Claytonia demissa, commonly known as the spring beauty, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features delicate, nodding flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its preferred moist, woodland habitats. Its root system consists of short, tuberous roots that store nutrients and allow it to survive harsh winter conditions. Claytonia demissa is often found in shaded areas, such as along forest floors or in rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid environments."
