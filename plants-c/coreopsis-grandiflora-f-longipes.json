    "intro": "Coreopsis grandiflora f. longipes, commonly known as the long-peduncled coreopsis, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, bright yellow ray flowers surrounded by dark orange disk florets, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems that can reach up to 2 feet in height, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. The variety 'longipes' is distinguished by its longer peduncles, which elevate the flower heads above the foliage."
