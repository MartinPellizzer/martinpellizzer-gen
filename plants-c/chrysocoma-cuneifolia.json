    "intro": "Chrysocoma cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf chrysocoma, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its woody stems are often branched and can grow up to several meters in height, making it a prominent feature in its natural habitat. Chrysocoma cuneifolia is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in traditional medicine by local communities."
