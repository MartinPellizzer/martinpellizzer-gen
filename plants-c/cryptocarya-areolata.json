    "intro": "Cryptocarya areolata, commonly known as the rough-leaved cryptocarya, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its rough, textured leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal and lowland forest environments, often in damp, shaded areas. Its fruit is a woody drupe that contains a single seed, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for native wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
