    "intro": "Chamelaucium roycei, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a small shrub native to the coastal regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in winter. The plant has adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is highly drought-tolerant. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, often covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Chamelaucium roycei plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
