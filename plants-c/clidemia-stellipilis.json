    "intro": "Clidemia stellipilis, commonly known as the star-haired mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and small, white flowers. The plant has a woody stem and produces small, red berries that are dispersed by birds. It grows on the branches of trees and shrubs, often forming dense clusters. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and health of its host plants."
