    "intro": "Cyperus aristatus var. runyonii, commonly known as the Runyon flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. It has fibrous roots and is adapted to tolerate flooded conditions, making it a common species in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats. Its presence is often an indicator of healthy wetland ecosystems."
