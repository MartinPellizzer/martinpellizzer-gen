    "intro": "Coprosma \u00d7 kirkii, commonly known as the kirk\u2019s coprosma, is a hybrid evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and showy, red or orange berries that appear in clusters. The plant typically grows in coastal and lowland areas, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are glossy and often have a slight pubescence, while the stems are woody and can become quite branched over time. Coprosma \u00d7 kirkii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to form dense thickets."
