It is characterized by its triangular, jointed stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late summer. Native to wetland environments, it thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are often green or reddish in color. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
