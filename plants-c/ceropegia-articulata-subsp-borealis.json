    "intro": "Ceropegia articulata subsp. borealis, commonly known as the Arctic moonvine, is a succulent plant native to northern regions of North America. It features trailing stems with opposite, fleshy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color, adapted for pollination by specific insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover in arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
