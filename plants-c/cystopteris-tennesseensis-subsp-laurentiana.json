    "intro": "Cystopteris tennesseensis subsp. laurentiana, commonly known as the Laurentian water fern, is a rare fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with finely divided pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in stream banks and along rocky outcrops. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in the genus Cystopteris. This subspecies is notable for its limited distribution and ecological specificity, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
