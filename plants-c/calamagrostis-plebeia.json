    "intro": "Calamagrostis plebeia, commonly known as the common reedgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to wet soils. The plant has tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, with narrow, blade-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a dense panicle of spikelets, which are small, clustered flower clusters. Calamagrostis plebeia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
