    "intro": "Cyperus sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian flatsedge, is a perennial herb native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green or brown. The plant thrives in wetland habitats, including marshes and stream banks, and is adapted to moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its presence in various wetland ecosystems. Cyperus sandwicensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
