    "intro": "Cydonia communis, commonly known as the quince, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It produces a fragrant, yellow or orange fruit that is typically harvested in late autumn. The fruit has a rough, bark-like skin and a sweet, aromatic pulp when ripe. The plant has pinnately compound leaves and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible fruit. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a cold winter to break dormancy and produce fruit."
