    "intro": "Conyza cuneata, commonly known as horseweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, white to yellowish composite flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. It produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread. Conyza cuneata is often considered a weed but has some medicinal uses in traditional herbal practices."
