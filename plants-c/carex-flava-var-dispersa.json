    "intro": "Carex flava var. dispersa, commonly known as the yellow sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its spreading growth habit and pale yellow inflorescence compared to the typical form of Carex flava."
