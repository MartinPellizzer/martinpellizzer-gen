It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, making it an effective pioneer species in disturbed or wet habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
