    "intro": "Cupania glauca, commonly known as the white-leaf cupania, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, white or pale green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, fleshy fruits. Its growth habit is compact, with multiple stems that can reach up to 3 meters in height. Cupania glauca is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks."
