    "intro": "Cardamine macrophylla var. crenata, commonly known as the broad-leaf watercress, is a perennial herb native to moist woodland areas in North America. It features alternate, trifoliate leaves with broad, heart-shaped leaflets that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender, upright stems. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils, making it a common sight in streamside habitats. The species is valued for its peppery flavor and is sometimes used in salads or as a garnish."
