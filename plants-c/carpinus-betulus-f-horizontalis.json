It is characterized by its distinctive horizontal branching pattern, which sets it apart from the typical vertical growth of the species. The plant has small, ovate leaves with a glossy upper surface and a pale underside. It produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, dark blue berries. This ornamental tree is often cultivated for its unique appearance and adaptability to various soil conditions."
