It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cordylanthus rigidus is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
