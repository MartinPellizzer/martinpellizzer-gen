    "intro": "Cyperus pulcher var. prasinus, commonly known as the Emerald Grass or Green Cyperus, is a flowering plant in the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with a striking green hue, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, thriving in areas with consistently moist soil. Its slender, cylindrical stems are often clustered together, forming a compact, low-growing plant. The inflorescence consists of small, spike-like clusters of flowers, which are usually green or brown in color."
