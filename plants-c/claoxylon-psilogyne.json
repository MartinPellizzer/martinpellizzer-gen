    "intro": "Claoxylon psilogyne, commonly known as the African yellowwood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Claoxylon psilogyne is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also used in traditional medicine."
