It typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are blue to purple in color, arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and bloom from late spring to early summer. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
