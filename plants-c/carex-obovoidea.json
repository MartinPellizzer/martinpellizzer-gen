    "intro": "Carex obovoidea, commonly known as the broad-ovate sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, cylindrical cluster. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, which are usually borne on a spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Carex obovoidea is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
