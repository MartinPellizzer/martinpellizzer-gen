    "intro": "Cuviera crinita, commonly known as the curly hair fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The leaves are bioluminescent, a unique trait that helps it attract nocturnal pollinators."
