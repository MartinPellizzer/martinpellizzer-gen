    "intro": "Cissus zombitsy, commonly known as the zombie vine, is a climbing plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Vitaceae and is characterized by its trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Cissus zombitsy is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
