    "intro": "Cardamine flaccida subsp. minima, commonly known as the small-flowered water crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, shaded habitats in temperate regions. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often near streams and wetlands. Its rhizomatous root system helps it spread and establish in suitable environments. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
