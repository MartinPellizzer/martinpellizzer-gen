    "intro": "Cassia meelii, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a distinctive yellowish-green color. The plant produces bright orange to red flowers in clusters, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are encased in long, narrow pods that split open when mature. Cassia meelii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
