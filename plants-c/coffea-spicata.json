    "intro": "Coffea spicata, commonly known as the spiny coffee plant, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its spiny branches and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries containing the seeds used for coffee. Its botanical features make it distinct from other coffee species, though it is less commonly cultivated for commercial coffee production. The plant's adaptability to various soil types and climate conditions contributes to its presence in diverse ecosystems."
