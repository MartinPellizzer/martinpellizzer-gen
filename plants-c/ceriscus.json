It is characterized by its striking, often blue or purple, ray flowers and spiky, bract-like leaves. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and saline soils, showcasing their adaptability to harsh environments. The flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, dry fruits called cypsela. Ceriscus species are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and resilience."
