    "intro": "Canthium egregium, commonly known as the giant spurred spurge, is a striking member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and showy, spiny floral structures. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that are often surrounded by fleshy, colorful bracts. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its invasive potential in some areas, it requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption."
