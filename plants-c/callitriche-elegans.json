    "intro": "Callitriche elegans, commonly known as the water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and marshes. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, opposite, oval-shaped leaves. Its flowers are tiny, white or pale blue, and are arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. Callitriche elegans is an important part of aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish."
