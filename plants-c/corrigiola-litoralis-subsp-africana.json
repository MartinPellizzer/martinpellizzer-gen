    "intro": "Corrigiola litoralis subsp. africana, commonly known as the African sea blite, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and coastal environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, often in areas with high salt exposure. The plant has small, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, edible seeds. This subspecies is native to Africa and is valued for its nutritional content and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
