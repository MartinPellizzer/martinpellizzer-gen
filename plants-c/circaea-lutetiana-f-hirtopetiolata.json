    "intro": "Circaea lutetiana f. hirtopetiolata, commonly known as the hairy-petioled wood sorrel, is a botanical variant of the common wood sorrel. It is characterized by its hairy stems and petioles, which distinguish it from the typical form. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive white or pale green coloration. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. This subspecies is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
