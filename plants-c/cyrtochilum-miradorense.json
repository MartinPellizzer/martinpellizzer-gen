    "intro": "Cyrtochilum miradorense, commonly known as the Mirador orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming during the dry season. Its roots are specialized for epiphytic growth, allowing it to thrive on tree trunks and branches. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
