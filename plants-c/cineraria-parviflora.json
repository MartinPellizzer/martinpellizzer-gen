    "intro": "Cineraria parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered cineraria, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows as a low-growing shrub with silvery-gray foliage that helps reflect sunlight in its native arid environment. It produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in spring and summer, adding a delicate touch to gardens. Cineraria parviflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
