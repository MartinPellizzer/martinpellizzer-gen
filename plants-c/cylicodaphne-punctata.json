    "intro": "Cylicodaphne punctata, commonly known as the bamboo palm, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often mistaken for bamboo, though it is actually a member of the Arecaceae family. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets that give it a feathery appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, round fruits that are often consumed by wildlife. Cylicodaphne punctata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
