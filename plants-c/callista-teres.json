    "intro": "Callista teres, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Callista teres thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland forests or along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a valuable ornamental plant and an invasive species in some regions."
