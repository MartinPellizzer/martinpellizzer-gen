    "intro": "Claytonia spatulifolia, commonly known as the spoonleaf springbeauty, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves and produces clusters of delicate, white or pinkish flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. It is a herbaceous perennial that blooms from March to May depending on the region. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological importance in early-season pollination networks."
