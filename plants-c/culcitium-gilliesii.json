It belongs to the family Flacourtiaceae and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous bark has historically been used by M\u0101ori for making baskets, ropes, and other woven items. Culcitium gilliesii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
