    "intro": "Cicuta virosa f. longiinvolucellata, commonly known as the long-involucelated water hemlock, is a variant of the water hemlock species characterized by its distinctive floral structure. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia, typically found in moist, shaded environments such as stream sides and woodland areas. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, umbrella-like clusters called umbels. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with finely toothed margins, and it is known for its highly toxic sap containing cicutoxin. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided by both livestock and humans, making it a plant of caution rather than cultivation."
