    "intro": "Chuquiraga tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly chuquiraga, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Chuquiraga tomentosa is often used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
