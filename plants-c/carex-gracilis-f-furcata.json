    "intro": "Carex gracilis f. furcata, commonly known as the forked sedge, is a variant of the slender sedge, characterized by its distinctive branching inflorescence. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly rough texture. The flowering spikes, which are usually two to three in number, are arranged in a way that gives the plant its common name."
