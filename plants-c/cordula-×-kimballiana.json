    "intro": "Cordula \u00d7 kimballiana, commonly known as the hybrid cordula, is a rare ornamental plant belonging to the family Ericaceae. It is a hybrid between Cordula europaea and Cordula trachysperma, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parent species. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and valuable addition to botanical collections."
