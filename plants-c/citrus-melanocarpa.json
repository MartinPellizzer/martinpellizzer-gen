It produces small, round fruits that are typically dark purple to black when mature, though they can also be yellow or orange. The fruit has a thick, aromatic rind and a tart, acidic pulp with a unique flavor profile. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and used in traditional medicine. The plant prefers warm, humid climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
