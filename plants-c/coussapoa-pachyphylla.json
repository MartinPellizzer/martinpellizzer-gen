    "intro": "Coussapoa pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved pittosporum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Pittosporaceae. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its native environment. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. It is often found growing in coastal or forested areas, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
