    "intro": "Citrus australasica var. sanguinea, commonly known as the blood orange. This variant is characterized by its distinctive deep red or purple pigmentation in the fruit's flesh, which is due to high concentrations of anthocyanins. The plant is a small evergreen shrub native to Australia, typically growing in coastal areas with well-drained soils. Its leaves are glossy and elliptical, while the flowers are fragrant and white. The fruit is generally smaller than common citrus fruits and is prized for its unique color and flavor."
