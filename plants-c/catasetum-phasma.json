    "intro": "Catasetum phasma, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous inflorescence and its unique, ghost-like appearance, which gives it its common name. The plant is epiphytic, growing on trees and other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically white or pale in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of a ghost or spirit. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Catasetum phasma is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
