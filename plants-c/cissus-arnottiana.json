    "intro": "Cissus arnottiana, commonly known as the climbing cissus, is a vigorous vine native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by distinctive, triangular, waxy fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular choice for trellises and vertical gardens."
