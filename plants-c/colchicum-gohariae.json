    "intro": "Colchicum gohariae, commonly known as the Gohari colchicum, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Colchicaceae and is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces distinctive, spurred flowers that are adapted to attract specific pollinators. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
