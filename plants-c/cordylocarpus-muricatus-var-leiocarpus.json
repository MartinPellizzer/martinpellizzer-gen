    "intro": "Cordylocarpus muricatus var. leiocarpus, commonly known as the smooth-fruited sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, blue-violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dune environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well adapted to harsh coastal conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil."
