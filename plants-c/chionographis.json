    "intro": "Chionographis, commonly known as the snowgrass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere, where it thrives in cold, harsh environments. The plants typically have low-growing, mat-forming growth habits with small, often hairy leaves. Their flowers are usually white or pale blue, arranged in compact clusters, and bloom during the short summer season. Chionographis species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in extreme climates."
