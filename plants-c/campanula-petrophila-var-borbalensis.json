    "intro": "Campanula petrophila var. borbalensis, commonly known as the Borb\u00e1len campanula, is a rare and endemic species native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its bell-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky and limestone-rich soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to withstand harsh mountain conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
