    "intro": "Cinnagrostis rupestris, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments in North America. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to its rocky surroundings. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in crevices or on slopes where moisture is limited. Due to its hardy nature and ability to colonize difficult terrain, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
