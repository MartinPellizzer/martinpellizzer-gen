    "intro": "Corallocarpus palmatus, commonly known as the palmate corallocarpus, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its palm-like leaves that are deeply lobed and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense undergrowth of rainforests. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
