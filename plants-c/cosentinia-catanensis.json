    "intro": "Cosentinia catanensis, commonly known as the Catanese cosentinia, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Sicily. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
