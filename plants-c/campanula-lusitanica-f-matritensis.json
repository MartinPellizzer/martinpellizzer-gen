    "intro": "Campanula lusitanica f. matritensis, commonly known as the Madrid bellflower, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
