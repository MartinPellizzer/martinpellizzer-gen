It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and elongated, narrow leaves with a striated appearance. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and it is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Crotalaria striata typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod, and the plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
