    "intro": "Carex paupercula subsp. irrigua, commonly known as the slender sedges, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. This subspecies is native to regions with moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It has a robust root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant is relatively low maintenance and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and aesthetic value."
