    "intro": "Cuscuta decora var. neuropetala, commonly known as the pink morning glory, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in the morning. The plant has a slender, winding stem that twines around its host, forming a dense network of parasitic connections. Its seeds are small and dry, often dispersed by wind or animals. This species is native to North America and is commonly found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
