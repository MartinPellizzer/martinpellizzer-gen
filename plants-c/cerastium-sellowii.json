It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its mat-forming habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically features hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are usually pink or white, blooming in early spring, and it thrives in rocky or sandy soils. Cerastium sellowii is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
