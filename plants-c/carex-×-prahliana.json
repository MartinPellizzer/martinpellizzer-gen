    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 prahliana, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Carex stricta and Carex lyngbyei, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant forms dense, grass-like clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often dark green in color. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wetlands, and is commonly found in temperate regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a resilient and persistent species in its native habitat."
