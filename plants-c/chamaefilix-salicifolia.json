It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has linear, willow-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Chamaefilix salicifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
