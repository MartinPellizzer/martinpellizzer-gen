    "intro": "Calandrinia capituligera, commonly known as the desert four o'clock, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Portulacaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the late afternoon. The plant produces small, bead-like fruits called elaterium, which contain seeds dispersed by wind. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its ability to store water and reduce transpiration. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in xerophytic plant adaptations."
