    "intro": "Cuscuta pulcherrima, commonly known as the golden dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow-orange flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often found on various shrubs and trees. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and sometimes through human activity. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
