    "intro": "Chrysothamnus collinus, commonly known as the silverleaf goldenbush, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in dense, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in branched inflorescences. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert environments. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid climates and it is sometimes used in xeriscaping."
