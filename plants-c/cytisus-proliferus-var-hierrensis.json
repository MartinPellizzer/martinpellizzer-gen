It is characterized by its dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces long, slender pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in coastal or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
