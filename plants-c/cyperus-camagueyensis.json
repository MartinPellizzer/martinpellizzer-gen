    "intro": "Cyperus camagueyensis, commonly known as the Camag\u00fcey flatsedge, is a species of flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba, and thrives in wetland environments such as marshes and shallow water areas. The plant has slender, grass-like stems and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically pale green to brown in color. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Cyperus camagueyensis is often found in disturbed wetlands and can be an indicator of environmental changes in its ecosystem."
