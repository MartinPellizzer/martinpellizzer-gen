    "intro": "Calonemorchis longiclavata, commonly known as the long-clawed orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and linear, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with a distinctive long, narrow spur, which is a defining botanical feature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is a subject of interest in both botanical research and horticultural cultivation."
