    "intro": "Convolvulus arvensis, commonly known as field bindweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped pink or white flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to persist in various soil types and thrive in disturbed environments. Its vines can grow up to 3 meters long, and it is known for its aggressive spreading habit. Field bindweed is considered a noxious weed in many regions due to its tenacity and difficulty in eradication."
