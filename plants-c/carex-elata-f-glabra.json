It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of a tall, cylindrical spike that bears small, wind-pollinated flowers. The smooth, glabrous leaves and robust growth habit make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in wetland habitats."
