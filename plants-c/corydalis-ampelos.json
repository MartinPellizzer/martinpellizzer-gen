    "intro": "Corydalis ampelos, commonly known as the hanging corydalis, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its slender, trailing stems that often hang from rock crevices or cliffs. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or purple, with two upper petals that are broader than the lower ones. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stems, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Corydalis ampelos is valued in horticulture for its ability to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils and its long blooming period."
