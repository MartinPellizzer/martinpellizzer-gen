It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its striking clusters of violet-blue berries. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous. The berries, which are edible when ripe, are a key feature of the plant and attract various bird species."
