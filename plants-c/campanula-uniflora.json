    "intro": "Campanula uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear a single, bell-shaped flower at the top of each stem, typically in shades of blue or purple. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Campanula uniflora thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or alpine settings. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its delicate, bell-like blooms."
