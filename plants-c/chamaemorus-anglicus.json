    "intro": "Chamaemorus anglicus, commonly known as the Scottish heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Scottish Highlands and northern England. It features small, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and moorland habitats. Chamaemorus anglicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
