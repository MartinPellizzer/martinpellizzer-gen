It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces distinctive, hooked fruit capsules that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant ecology and botany."
