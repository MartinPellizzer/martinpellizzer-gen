    "intro": "Cyperus virginicus, commonly known as the common flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, such as marshes, swamps, and wetlands. The plant has slender, grass-like stems and produces small, triangular spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the plant. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it is often found in disturbed or muddy soils. Cyperus virginicus plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
