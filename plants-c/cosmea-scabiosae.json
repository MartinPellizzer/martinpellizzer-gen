It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that are often arranged in a basal rosette, and its stems are upright with a woolly texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine habitats.
