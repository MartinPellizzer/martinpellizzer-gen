    "intro": "Celtis salomonensis, commonly known as the Solomon Islands hackberry, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the Pacific islands, particularly the Solomon Islands. It belongs to the Cannabaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by small, round berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe. Celtis salomonensis is often found in lowland forests and is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used for construction and tool-making."
