    "intro": "Cruckshanksia capitata var. densifolia, commonly known as the dense-leaved cruckshanksia, is a distinctive plant with unique botanical features. It is characterized by its dense, overlapping foliage that gives it a compact and bushy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically borne on short, sturdy stems. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a slightly waxy texture, which helps in reducing water loss. This variety is often found in shaded, moist environments, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens."
