    "intro": "Centaurea micrantha var. laxa, commonly known as the lax centaury, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant produces bracts that are often mistaken for flowers, a characteristic common in the genus Centaurea. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and prolonged blooming period."
