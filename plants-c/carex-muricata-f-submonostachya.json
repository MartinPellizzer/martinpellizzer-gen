    "intro": "Carex muricata f. submonostachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a variant of the common bulrush, characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. It is a perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments, often found in temperate regions. The plant has a robust rhizomatous root system that helps stabilize soil and filter water. Its flowers are typically greenish or brownish, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in wetland restoration and its ornamental appeal in water gardens."
