    "intro": "Cryptandra arbutiflora, commonly known as the honeycomb bush, is a shrub native to western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruits are woody capsules that split open to release seeds. Cryptandra arbutiflora is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland heathlands."
