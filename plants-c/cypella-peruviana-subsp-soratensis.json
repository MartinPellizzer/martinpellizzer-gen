It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
