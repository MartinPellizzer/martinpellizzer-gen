    "intro": "Coix lacryma-jobi var. gigantea, commonly known as Job's tears or Chinese pearl millet, is a member of the grass family (Poaceae). It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and distinctive, drooping, tear-shaped seeds that are often used in traditional medicine and cuisine. The plant is native to East Asia and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its seeds are encased in a hard, fibrous outer layer, which makes them resistant to drying out. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal, with its tall, elegant appearance making it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
