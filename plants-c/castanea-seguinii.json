    "intro": "Castanea seguinii, commonly known as the Seguin chestnut, is a species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Mexico. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10 to 15 meters, featuring broad, ovate leaves with a rough, hairy texture on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in panicles, followed by spiny, capsule-like fruits that contain one or two edible nuts. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in the Castanea genus, with unique adaptations to its native habitat."
