    "intro": "Cyclamen aestivum, commonly known as the summer cyclamen, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and showy, spurred flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of about 15-20 cm, with hairy stems and fleshy, tuberous roots that help it survive dry periods. Its flowers come in shades of pink, red, and white, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Cyclamen aestivum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its beauty and seasonal blooming."
