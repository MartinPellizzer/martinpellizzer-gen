    "intro": "Chaetochloa forbesiana, commonly known as the Forbe's hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, hair-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowering stems produce small, spikelet-like inflorescences, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland gardens."
