    "intro": "Ceraia papilionifera, commonly known as the butterfly bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive butterfly-like shape. The plant produces elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is valued for both its ornamental appeal and nutritional properties. Ceraia papilionifera is also an important plant in agroforestry systems due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
