    "intro": "Cousinia adnata, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a perennial herb that grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in high-altitude environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of silky hair, helping to reduce water loss. Cousinia adnata is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
