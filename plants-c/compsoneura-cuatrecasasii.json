It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its unique leaf morphology and flowering structure. The plant exhibits a climbing habit, with compound leaves that have a distinctive venation pattern. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its fruits are follicles that release seeds through a specialized mechanism. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Compsoneura cuatrecasasii is considered a species of conservation concern."
