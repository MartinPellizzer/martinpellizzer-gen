    "intro": "Capsella batavorum, commonly known as the common mouse-ear or mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters, featuring small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, round seed pods that split open when mature. Capsella batavorum is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
