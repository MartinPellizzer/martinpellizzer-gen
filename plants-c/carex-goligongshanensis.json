    "intro": "Carex goligongshanensis, commonly known as the Goligongshan sedge, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the mountainous regions of southwest China. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and stream sides. It produces small, clustered spikelets that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Carex goligongshanensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
