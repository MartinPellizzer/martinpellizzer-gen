It is native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a slender, upright stem with clusters of delicate, butterfly-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. Camutia blooms during the spring and early summer, producing a fragrant nectar that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a valuable species in both horticultural and conservation contexts."
