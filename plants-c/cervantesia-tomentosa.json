    "intro": "Cervantesia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly cervantesia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by small, leathery fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is sometimes cultivated in arid gardens for ornamental purposes."
