    "intro": "Cuscuta balansae var. socotrensis, commonly known as the Socotra dodder, is a parasitic plant native to the Arabian Peninsula, particularly Socotra Island. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, attaching itself with specialized haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, vine-like structure. It is adapted to arid environments and exhibits rapid growth when it comes into contact with a suitable host. Its unique ecological role makes it an important subject in studies of parasitic plant biology."
