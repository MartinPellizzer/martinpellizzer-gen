It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often before its foliage emerges. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in dry conditions. Cerastium crassipes is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky habitats, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
