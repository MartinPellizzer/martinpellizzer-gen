    "intro": "Carlina macrophylla, commonly known as the bigleaf cudweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features a rosette of large, waxy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-centered flower heads that bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. Its botanical structure supports its role as a nectar source for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
