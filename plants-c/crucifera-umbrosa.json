    "intro": "Crucifera umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow mustard, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth. Its seeds are encased in a capsule, a common feature among members of the crucifer family. Due to its preference for low-light conditions, it is often found in areas with dense vegetation."
