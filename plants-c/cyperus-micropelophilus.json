    "intro": "Cyperus micropelophilus, commonly known as the dwarf flatsedge, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit. It is a small, herbaceous plant typically found in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, clustered inflorescences produce tiny, three-lobed flowers that are usually pale green to brown in color. Cyperus micropelophilus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
