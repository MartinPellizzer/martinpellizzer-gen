It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered in soft, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils. It is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas."
