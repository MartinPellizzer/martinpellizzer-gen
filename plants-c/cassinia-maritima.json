    "intro": "Cassinia maritima, commonly known as sea cassinia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, which are characteristic of the Asteraceae family. It has silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in its arid coastal environment. Cassinia maritima is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
