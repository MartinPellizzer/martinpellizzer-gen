    "intro": "Conostylis rogeri, commonly known as the coastal conostylis, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae and is characterized by its erect, often hairy stems and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically from spring to early summer. Conostylis rogeri is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common sight in coastal dunes and heathlands. Its ecological importance includes providing nectar for native pollinators and stabilizing coastal vegetation."
