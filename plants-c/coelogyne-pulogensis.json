    "intro": "Coelogyne pulogensis, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers and long, pendant-like blooms that appear during the late summer to early autumn. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are strap-like and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Coelogyne pulogensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a suitable environment."
