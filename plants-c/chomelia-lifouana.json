It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
