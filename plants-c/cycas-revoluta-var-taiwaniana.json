    "intro": "Cycas revoluta var. taiwaniana, commonly known as the Taiwan cycad, is a rare variant of the cycad species native to Taiwan. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnate, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces cones, with male cones bearing numerous pollen sacs and female cones producing ovules that develop into seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, requiring well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
