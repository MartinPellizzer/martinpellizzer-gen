    "intro": "Calytriplex, commonly known as desert parsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the western United States and northern Mexico. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Calytriplex is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
