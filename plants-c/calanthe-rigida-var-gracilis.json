    "intro": "Calanthe rigida var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender hardy orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features a compact, rhizomatous growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences bearing small to medium-sized flowers with three sepals and three petals. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and adaptability to cooler, moist environments."
