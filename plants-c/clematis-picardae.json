    "intro": "Clematis picardae, commonly known as the flame clematis, is a vigorous climbing vine native to South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a yellow throat. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are covered in fine, rusty-colored hairs. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners looking to add dramatic floral displays. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
