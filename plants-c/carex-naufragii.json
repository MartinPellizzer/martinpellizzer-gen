    "intro": "Carex naufragii, commonly known as the shipwreck sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its small, clustered flowers appear in late spring to early summer, and it produces three-sided, spike-like inflorescences. Carex naufragii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in damp conditions."
