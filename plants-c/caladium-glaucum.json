    "intro": "Caladium glaucum, commonly known as the silverleaf caladium, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that often display a variegated pattern of white, pink, and green. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and prefers partial to full shade. Its foliage is the main ornamental feature, making it popular as a decorative houseplant or in garden landscapes. Caladium glaucum is typically propagated through tuberous roots, which can be planted in well-draining soil during the spring season."
