    "intro": "Chamaerhodiola fastigiata, commonly known as the dwarf fireweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Chamaerhodiola fastigiata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
