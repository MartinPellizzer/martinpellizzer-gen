It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments, often found in lowland rainforests. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, enhancing nutrient absorption. The fronds are used in traditional practices and are also valued for their ornamental appeal."
