    "intro": "Cyperorchis \u00d7 woodlandensis, commonly known as the woodland marsh orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces showy, orchid-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it an interesting subject for botanical study."
