    "intro": "Crotalaria perpusilla, commonly known as the dwarf rattlepod, is a small annual herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its small size and rapid growth, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
