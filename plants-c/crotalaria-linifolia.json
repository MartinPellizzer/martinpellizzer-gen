    "intro": "Crotalaria linifolia, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety layer of fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Native to Africa, it has been introduced to various regions, including the Americas, where it often becomes an invasive species. Its growth habits and reproductive strategies make it a significant weed in agricultural settings."
