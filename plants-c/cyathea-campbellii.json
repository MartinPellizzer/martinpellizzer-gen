    "intro": "Cyathea campbellii, commonly known as Campbell's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a robust rhizome system that supports its growth and helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds can grow up to 3 meters in length, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Cyathea campbellii is often found in forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions."
