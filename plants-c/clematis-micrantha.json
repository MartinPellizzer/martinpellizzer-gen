    "intro": "Clematis micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It features slender, twining stems that can reach lengths of up to 15 feet, allowing it to climb trees and shrubs. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a slightly hairy texture. Clematis micrantha is valued in gardens for its ornamental flowers and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable climates."
