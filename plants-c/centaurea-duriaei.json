It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and spiny leaves, which are typical of the genus Centaurea. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. It blooms from late spring to early autumn, producing clusters of small, showy flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.
