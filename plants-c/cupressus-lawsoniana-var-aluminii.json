    "intro": "Cupressus lawsoniana var. aluminii, commonly known as the Lawson's cypress variant, is a rare subspecies native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green foliage that remains throughout the year. The plant exhibits dense, scale-like leaves arranged in flat sprays, typical of the Cupressaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically unique species."
