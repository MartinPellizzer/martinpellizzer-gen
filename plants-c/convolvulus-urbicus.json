    "intro": "Convolvulus urbicus, commonly known as city bindweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the bindweed family (Convolvulaceae). It is a perennial herb that typically grows in disturbed soils and urban environments, such as sidewalks and vacant lots. The plant produces small, pale pink or white flowers with five petals, and its leaves are heart-shaped with a hairy texture. Its stems are twining and can climb or spread along the ground, often forming dense mats. It is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and can be considered an invasive species in some regions."
