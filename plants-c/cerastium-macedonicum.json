It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky slopes. Cerastium macedonicum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
