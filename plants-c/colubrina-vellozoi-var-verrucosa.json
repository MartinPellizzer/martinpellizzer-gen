    "intro": "Colubrina vellozoi var. verrucosa, commonly known as the rough colubrina, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in rough, scaly bark, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy texture with a slightly serrated edge. The rough colubrina is adapted to sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and dunes."
