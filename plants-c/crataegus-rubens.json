    "intro": "Crataegus rubens, commonly known as the red hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and oval-shaped leaves that turn a striking red or orange in the fall. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus rubens thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in native plant gardens and natural habitats."
