It is characterized by its upright, spiny stems and basal rosettes of gray-green, hairy leaves. The plant produces purple to pinkish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spherical heads. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
