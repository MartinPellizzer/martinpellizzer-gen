    "intro": "Chrysopsis villosa var. hispida, commonly known as the hispid chrysopsis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green foliage and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The varietal name \"hispida\" refers to the plant's rough, bristly texture."
