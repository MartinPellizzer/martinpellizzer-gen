    "intro": "Coix barbata, commonly known as the hairy bamboo or wild millet, is a member of the grass family Poaceae. It is native to East Asia and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and distinctive hairy nodes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are encased in a hard, fibrous shell, which can be processed into a nutritious grain. Coix barbata is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
