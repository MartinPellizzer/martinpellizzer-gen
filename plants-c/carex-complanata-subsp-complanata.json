    "intro": "Carex complanata subsp. complanata, commonly known as the flat-leaved sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, flat leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a key role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
