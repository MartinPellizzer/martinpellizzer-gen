    "intro": "Calceolaria alata subsp. antioquiensis, commonly known as the Antioquian slipper orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped calyces that enclose the flowers, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests. Its flowers are usually violet or purple, with a striking contrast against its green foliage. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
