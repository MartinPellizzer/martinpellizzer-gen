    "intro": "Campylopora, commonly known as the sea fan, is a type of stony coral found in tropical and subtropical marine environments. It belongs to the order Gorgonacea and is characterized by its branching, fan-like structure composed of calcium carbonate. The polyps of Campylopora are small and often covered in symbiotic algae, which contribute to its vibrant colors. It plays a crucial role in reef ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine organisms. Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is often used as an indicator of reef health."
