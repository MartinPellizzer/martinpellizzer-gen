    "intro": "Cyanea sessilifolia, commonly known as the Hawaiian hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly Hawaii. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy texture, while its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Cyanea sessilifolia plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing nectar for native birds and insects."
