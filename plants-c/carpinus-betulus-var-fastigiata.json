    "intro": "Carpinus betulus var. fastigiata, commonly known as the columnar hornbeam, is a striking deciduous tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, upright growth habit, which makes it ideal for small spaces or as a specimen plant. The tree has small, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn, adding seasonal interest. Its bark is smooth and greyish-brown, becoming fissured with age. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
