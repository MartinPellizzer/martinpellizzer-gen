    "intro": "Castilleja integrifolia var. chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapan redshank, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the cloud forests of southern Mexico. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host for water and nutrients, forming a symbiotic relationship with various grasses and shrubs. It is often found in shaded, moist environments and is noted for its striking floral display. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered vulnerable and is of interest in botanical conservation efforts."
