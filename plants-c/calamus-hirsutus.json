    "intro": "Calamus hirsutus, commonly known as hairy calamus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Asia. It features long, slender rhizomes that grow horizontally beneath the water's surface. The plant produces tall, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in dense spikes near the water's edge. Calamus hirsutus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
