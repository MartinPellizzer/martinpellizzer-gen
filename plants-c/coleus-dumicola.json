It is characterized by its hairy, succulent leaves that are often tinged with red or purple hues. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or violet in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and drought-resistant gardens."
