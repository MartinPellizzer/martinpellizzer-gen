    "intro": "Castilleja oreopola subsp. olympica, commonly known as the Olympic mountain milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its bright red to orange flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
