It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and dry forests. The plant produces showy, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a waxy texture, while the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
