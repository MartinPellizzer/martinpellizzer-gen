It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a unique appearance. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread along the forest floor. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with a complex structure that enhances its ornamental value. Ctenopteris pruinosa thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
