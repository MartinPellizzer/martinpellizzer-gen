    "intro": "Calycolpus legrandii, commonly known as the legrand's calycolpus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the Caribbean islands, particularly Cuba and Hispaniola, where it thrives in moist, tropical environments. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often found in coastal areas and humid forests, where it plays a role in local ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
