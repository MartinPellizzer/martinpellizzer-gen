    "intro": "Chaerophyllum orthostylum, commonly known as the upright hogweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors. The plant features a tall, unbranched stem with large, compound leaves that are deeply lobed. Its small, white flowers are arranged in an umbel, typical of the carrot family. It is sometimes considered invasive in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
