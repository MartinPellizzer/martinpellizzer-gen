    "intro": "Conanthera johowii, commonly known as the Johow's false lily, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its umbel-like inflorescence. The plant features delicate, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, typical of the Apiaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Conanthera johowii is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
