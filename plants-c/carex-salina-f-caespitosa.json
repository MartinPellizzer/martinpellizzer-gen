    "intro": "Carex salina f. caespitosa, commonly known as salt meadow sedge, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and forms compact clumps, hence the subspecific name *caespitosa*. The plant thrives in saline or brackish wetlands, often found in tidal marshes and salt marshes. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand salt spray and wind. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
