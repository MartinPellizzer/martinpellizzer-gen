    "intro": "Cakile lanceolata var. integrifolia, commonly known as the coastal bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific coast of North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its fleshy, lobed leaves and small white or yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal dunes and shorelines. Its capsules produce numerous small seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its colonization of coastal environments. The species is adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient component of coastal ecosystems."
