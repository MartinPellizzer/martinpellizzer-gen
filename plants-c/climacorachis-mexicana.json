    "intro": "Climacorachis mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican mountain orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in cloud forests or on rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a short, fibrous root system adapted to its rocky habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
