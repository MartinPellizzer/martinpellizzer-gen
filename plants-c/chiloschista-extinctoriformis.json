    "intro": "Chiloschista extinctoriformis, commonly known as the flame violet, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to violet. The plant typically grows in rocky crevices and requires a cool, moist environment to thrive. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture, while its flowers bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, Chiloschista extinctoriformis is considered a critically endangered species."
