It is native to the mountainous regions of Fujian Province in China, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers. It is often found in shaded, forested areas and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
