    "intro": "Carduus confertus, commonly known as the common thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows. Its leaves are covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which contribute to its rough texture. The flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, and are visited by various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
