    "intro": "Carex brachystachys var. refracta, commonly known as the short-stalked sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in wetlands, swamps, or along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in wetland restoration projects. The variety refracta is distinguished by its shorter stamen clusters compared to the typical form of Carex brachystachys."
