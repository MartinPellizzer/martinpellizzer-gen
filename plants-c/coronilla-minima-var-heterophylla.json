    "intro": "Coronilla minima var. heterophylla, commonly known as the small crown vetch, is a low-growing perennial legume native to southern Europe. It features trifoliate leaves with finely toothed margins and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has a fibrous root system and is often found in dry, rocky soils. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for erosion control and ornamental use in gardens."
