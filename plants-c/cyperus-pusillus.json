    "intro": "Cyperus pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf sedges, is a small herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with slender, triangular stems and small, grass-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are often pale green or brown, arranged in spikelets. Cyperus pusillus thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
