    "intro": "Cyrtorchis crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its robust, fleshy leaves and distinctive, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure and vibrant colors make it a popular choice for both horticultural collections and botanical studies. Cyrtorchis crassifolia is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
