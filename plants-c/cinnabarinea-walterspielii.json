    "intro": "Cinnabarinea walterspielii, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its elongated, pale pink or white petals and a distinctive, ghostly appearance that gives it its common name. Native to the tropical regions of South America, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
