    "intro": "Ceratophyllum inerme, commonly known as the hornwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Ceratophyllaceae. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and small, scale-like leaves that give it a feathery appearance. This plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its stem, which is adapted for aquatic environments. It thrives in freshwater habitats and is often found in slow-moving or still waters. Ceratophyllum inerme is known for its ability to provide oxygen and habitat for aquatic life."
