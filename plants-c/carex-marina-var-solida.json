    "intro": "Carex marina var. solida, commonly known as the solid sea sedge, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. This variety is adapted to saline and brackish environments, making it a hardy plant in coastal ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize sandy or muddy shores. The plant plays an important role in preventing erosion and providing habitat for various coastal organisms."
