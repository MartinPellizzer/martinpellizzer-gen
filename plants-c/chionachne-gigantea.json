    "intro": "Chionachne gigantea, commonly known as the giant snowgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers during the summer months. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of tundra ecosystems."
