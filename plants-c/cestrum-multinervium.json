    "intro": "Cestrum multinervium, commonly known as the fragrant nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting moths and other nocturnal pollinators. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its pleasant nocturnal fragrance."
