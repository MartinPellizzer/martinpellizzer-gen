    "intro": "Cornus albida, commonly known as white dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its showy, white bract-like flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its bark is smooth and gray, often peeling in thin layers, and it has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated margin. Cornus albida thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
