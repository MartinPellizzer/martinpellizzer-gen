    "intro": "Calytrix cupressifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved calytrix, is a small evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features dense, compact foliage with narrow, dark green leaves that are arranged in a compact, upright habit. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salty air and well-drained soils. Calytrix cupressifolia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
