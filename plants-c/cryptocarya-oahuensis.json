    "intro": "Cryptocarya oahuensis, commonly known as the Oahu cryptocarya, is a rare endemic tree species native to the Hawaiian island of Oahu. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels and avocado trees, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as mesic forests and rock gardens. Its unique ecological role and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for conservationists. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it faces significant threats to its survival."
