It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, wetlands, and along riverbanks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, three-stamened flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Carex kenkolensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native environment."
