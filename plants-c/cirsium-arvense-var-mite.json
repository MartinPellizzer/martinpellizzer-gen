    "intro": "Cirsium arvense var. mite, commonly known as the common cocklebur, is a perennial weed native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and distinctive prickly, spherical fruit heads. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. Its flowers are yellow and appear in late summer, followed by the development of the burrs. Cirsium arvense var. mite is known for its aggressive growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
