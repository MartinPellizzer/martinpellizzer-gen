It is characterized by its low-growing habit and distinctive blue to purple flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its finely divided leaves and the presence of glandular hairs on its stems and leaves. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
