    "intro": "Cypripedium ernestianum, commonly known as the Ernestian lady's tresses, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of pale pink or white flowers that resemble a lace-like pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and meadows, often on acidic soils. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single, elongated spike of flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
