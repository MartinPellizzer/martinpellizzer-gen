    "intro": "Crypsis hadjikyriakou, commonly known as the Greek ghost flower, is a rare and elusive plant native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It is characterized by its small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer, often in shaded, rocky habitats. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that help it blend into its surroundings. Its botanical name reflects its secretive nature and the obscurity of its discovery. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
