    "intro": "Coincya pseudoerucastrum subsp. cintrana, commonly known as the slender water clover, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are borne on short pedicels. Its rhizomes help it spread vegetatively, allowing it to form dense mats in its environment. The species is adapted to nutrient-rich waters and can tolerate a range of water conditions."
