    "intro": "Corybas cryptanthus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a distinctive, showy flower that resembles a ghostly face, hence its common name. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and produces a single, pale green or white flower with a prominent, hood-like structure. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species."
