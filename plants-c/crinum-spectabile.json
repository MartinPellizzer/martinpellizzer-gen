    "intro": "Crinum spectabile, commonly known as the showy crinum, is a striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, showy white to pink flowers that have a strong, spicy fragrance. The leaves are broad, strap-like, and often persist through the winter, providing a lush green backdrop. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent rot. This plant is popular in gardens for its dramatic floral display and is often used in mixed borders or as a focal point in landscaped areas."
