    "intro": "Culcitium candidum, commonly known as the white bladdergrass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, white, bladder-like leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported diuretic properties. Culcitium candidum thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats."
