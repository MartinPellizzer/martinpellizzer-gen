These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa and are characterized by their showy, clustered flowers. The leaves are typically velvety and heart-shaped, often with a waxy coating. Ctenardisia species are popular as ornamental plants due to their vibrant colors and compact growth habit. They thrive in bright, indirect light and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
