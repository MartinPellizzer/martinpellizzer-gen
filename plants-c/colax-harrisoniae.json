It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
