    "intro": "Cheilanthes obducta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. Native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, it thrives in rocky soils and crevices. The plant is drought-tolerant and has adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically found on the underside of the fronds."
