    "intro": "Conyza lyrata, commonly known as the lyrata ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is an annual herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, pale yellow to white flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils. Conyza lyrata is often found in disturbed areas and is considered an indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
