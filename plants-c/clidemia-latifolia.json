    "intro": "Clidemia latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf clidemia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are broad and opposite, often with a waxy texture, and the flowers are usually pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Clidemia latifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in the humid climate."
