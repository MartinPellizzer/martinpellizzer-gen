    "intro": "Cynara cardunculus subsp. flavescens, commonly known as the globe thistle, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spherical, spiky blue or purple flower heads that resemble a globe, surrounded by dense, silver-gray foliage. The plant produces a milky latex when the stems or leaves are broken, which is a common feature in the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are usually broad and deeply lobed, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
