    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris viarum, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It features small, white or pink flowers and hairy, alternate leaves that are often lobed or notched. The plant produces small, round seeds enclosed in a structure called a silique, which is characteristic of the mustard family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it a common weed in many regions."
