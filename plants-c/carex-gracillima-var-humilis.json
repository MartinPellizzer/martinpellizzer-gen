    "intro": "Carex gracillima var. humilis, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wet or moist habitats in North America. It typically forms dense clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of inconspicuous greenish flowers in early summer, followed by dark, berry-like seeds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is a popular choice for wetland restoration and native plant gardens."
