    "intro": "Copiapoa cinerea subsp. eremophila, commonly known as the pale copiapoa, is a cacti species native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white to grayish spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the rainy season, typically in late winter to early spring. It is adapted to extreme arid conditions, storing water in its thick stems. This subspecies is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and over-collection."
