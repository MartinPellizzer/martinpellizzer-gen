It is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific, thriving in humid, shaded environments. This plant features a tall, unbranched trunk covered in a persistent, fibrous layer of old fronds. Its fronds are large, feather-like, and can grow up to several meters in length. Cyathea procera plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing shelter and contributing to soil stability."
