    "intro": "Coronilla glauca f. formosa, commonly known as the blue crown vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial legume characterized by its slender, trailing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system. The formosa form is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and slightly larger flowers compared to the typical variety."
