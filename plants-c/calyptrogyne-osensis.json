    "intro": "Calyptrogyne osensis, commonly known as the West Indian mangrove, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in saline and brackish water environments. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in greenish-white or pale yellow hues. Calyptrogyne osensis plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems, providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
