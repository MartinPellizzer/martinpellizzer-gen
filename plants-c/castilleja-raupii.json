    "intro": "Castilleja raupii, commonly known as the Raup's Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red, brush-like inflorescences. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for nutrients, often growing on grasses or shrubs. Its flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinator populations. Castilleja raupii is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
