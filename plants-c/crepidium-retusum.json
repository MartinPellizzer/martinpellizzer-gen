    "intro": "Crepidium retusum, commonly known as the broad-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to parts of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in a spike. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soil conditions. The orchid's reproductive strategy relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for successful seed germination."
