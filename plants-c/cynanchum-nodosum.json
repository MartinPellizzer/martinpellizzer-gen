    "intro": "Cynanchum nodosum, commonly known as the nodding milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Cynanchum nodosum is often found in grasslands and rocky areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
