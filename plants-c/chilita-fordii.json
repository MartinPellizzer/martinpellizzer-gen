    "intro": "Chilita fordii, commonly known as the Ford's chilita, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of China. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chilita fordii is considered a species of conservation concern."
