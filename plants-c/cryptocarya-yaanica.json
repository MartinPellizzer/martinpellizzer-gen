    "intro": "Cryptocarya yaanica, commonly known as the Yaanica laurel, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia, particularly in Queensland. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically elliptical and have a glossy surface. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by edible berries. Cryptocarya yaanica plays a role in its ecosystem as both a food source for native animals and a component of the forest understory."
