    "intro": "Claytonia multiscapa subsp. czukczorum, commonly known as the Alaska mountain chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Alaska. It features rosettes of fleshy, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, adapted to retain moisture in cold, arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine meadows. Its botanical structure reflects its adaptation to harsh, high-altitude conditions."
