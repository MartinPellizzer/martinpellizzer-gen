    "intro": "Ceratopteris thalictroides, commonly known as the running shield fern, is a member of the water fern family, Cyatheaceae. It is a perennial fern that exhibits a unique growth pattern, with a creeping rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds. The plant is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The fronds are typically green with a leathery texture, and the plant can be propagated through spores or by dividing the rhizome."
