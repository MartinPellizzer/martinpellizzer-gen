    "intro": "Cinchona lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf quinine tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries. It is part of the Rubiaceae family and is known for its historical use in the production of quinine. However, its botanical significance extends beyond medicinal applications, as it plays a role in the ecological systems of its native habitat."
