It features compound leaves with three to five elliptical leaflets, and its flowers are typically white or pale blue with five petals. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow berries that ripen to red, containing seeds dispersed by birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its natural habitat, making it a distinctive member of the Ranunculaceae family."
