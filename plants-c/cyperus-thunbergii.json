    "intro": "Cyperus thunbergii, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Southeast Asia. It features tall, slender stems that often grow in dense clumps, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered at the top of the stems. Cyperus thunbergii is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in wet or moist conditions. It is also valued for its role in wetland ecosystems, where it helps stabilize soil and provide habitat for various organisms."
