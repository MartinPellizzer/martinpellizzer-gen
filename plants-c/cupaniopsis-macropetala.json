    "intro": "Cupaniopsis macropetala, commonly known as the large-flowered cupaniopsis, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its showy, yellowish-green flowers clustered in spherical inflorescences. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible for some native animals. Cupaniopsis macropetala is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in dry, coastal environments."
