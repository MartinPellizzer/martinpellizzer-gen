    "intro": "Centronia neblinae, commonly known as the misty centronia, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences and small, pale greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures, typically found in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss. Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, Centronia neblinae is considered endangered."
