    "intro": "Cleistocactus villamontesii var. longiflorior, commonly known as the long-flowered cleistocactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows in rocky or limestone soils. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its unique flowering pattern and compact growth make it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
