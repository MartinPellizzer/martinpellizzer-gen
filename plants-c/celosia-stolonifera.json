    "intro": "Celosia stolonifera, commonly known as the flame flower or crown of thorns, is a tropical annual plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant, spiky bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant has a bushy growth habit and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the axils of its foliage. It thrives in warm, sunny conditions and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance. Celosia stolonifera is also known for its ability to propagate through both seeds and stolons, making it a resilient and easy-to-grow species."
