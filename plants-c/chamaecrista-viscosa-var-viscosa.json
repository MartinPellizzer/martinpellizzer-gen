It is characterized by its small, yellow, pea-like flowers and compound leaves with small, sticky glands. The plant produces elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands. Its sticky foliage and showy flowers make it a distinctive and sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
