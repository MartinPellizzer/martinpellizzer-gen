    "intro": "Colchicum autumnale subsp. pannonicum, commonly known as the Pannonian autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Southeastern Europe. It belongs to the family Colchicaceae and is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically basal and covered in a waxy coating. It produces distinctive red-brown capsules that contain toxic seeds, which are part of its defense mechanism against herbivores. This subspecies is often found in moist meadows and woodland edges, where it thrives in partial shade."
