    "intro": "Chamaesyce caecorum, commonly known as the blindweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically reaches a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters and has small, pale green to yellowish leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white, which bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Chamaesyce caecorum is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is considered a weed in some regions."
