    "intro": "Cynanchum blandum, commonly known as blue milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by seed pods that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Cynanchum blandum is also known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds and serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
