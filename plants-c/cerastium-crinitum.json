    "intro": "Cerastium crinitum, commonly known as the silky mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, silky white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along streambanks. Cerastium crinitum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in garden settings for its delicate foliage and early blooming habit."
