It belongs to the flowering plant family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white, woolly flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the dry season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Cordia galapagensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
