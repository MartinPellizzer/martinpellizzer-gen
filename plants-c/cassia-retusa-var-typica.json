    "intro": "Cassia retusa var. typica, commonly known as the Indian laburnum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and consist of several oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces bright yellow, pendulous flower clusters that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in long, narrow pods that split open to release winged seeds for wind dispersal. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
