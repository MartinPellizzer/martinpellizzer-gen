    "intro": "Ceropegia marlothii, commonly known as the African violet or the string of hearts, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. It thrives in partial shade and well-draining soil, often growing in rocky or sandy habitats. Ceropegia marlothii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
