It is characterized by its slender, pendant-like inflorescence and fragrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has strap-shaped, evergreen leaves and grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks. It prefers warm, humid environments with high light exposure and well-draining substrates. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated for its beauty and fragrance in both home and greenhouse settings."
