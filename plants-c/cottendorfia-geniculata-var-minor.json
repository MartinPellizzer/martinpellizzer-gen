    "intro": "Cottendorfia geniculata var. minor, commonly known as the lesser cottendorfia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom during the cooler months, and it is often found in grassland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
