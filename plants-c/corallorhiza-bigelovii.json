    "intro": "Corallorhiza bigelovii, commonly known as the bigelow's coralroot, is a species of orchid that lacks chlorophyll and is entirely dependent on mycorrhizal fungi for its nutrition. It is a small, herbaceous plant with a slender, branching stem and small, scale-like leaves. The flowers are typically pale yellow to orange-red, arranged in a loose spike, and are adapted for pollination by insects. This plant thrives in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. It is native to the central and eastern United States and is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
