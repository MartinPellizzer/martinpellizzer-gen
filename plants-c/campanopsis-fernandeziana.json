    "intro": "Campanopsis fernandeziana, commonly known as the Fernandez's bellflower, is a species of flowering plant native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats, thriving in the unique environmental conditions of its island home. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
