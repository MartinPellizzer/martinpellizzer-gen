    "intro": "Citharexylum caudatum, commonly known as the silky tamarind, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by elliptical, woody fruits. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Citharexylum caudatum thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish."
