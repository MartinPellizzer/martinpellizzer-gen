    "intro": "Cyclosorus albidipilosus, commonly known as the white-hairy cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its reproductive structures include small, yellowish flowers that develop into round, bladder-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
