    "intro": "Carex hamlinii, commonly known as Hamlin's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. Carex hamlinii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
