    "intro": "Coryphopteris pubirachis var. tahitensis, commonly known as the Tahitian hanger fern, is a fern species native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its long, drooping fronds that resemble hanging curtains, giving it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that help anchor it to moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is often found in humid, tropical forests where it thrives in shaded, well-drained soil."
