    "intro": "Celsia layardii, commonly known as the Layard's celsia, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to the arid regions of South America. It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low precipitation. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind. Celsia layardii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in dry gardens and rockeries."
