    "intro": "Cheilanthes peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in rocky, arid environments, often growing on limestone or granite substrates. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth form with dark green, leathery fronds that are resistant to drought. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This species is well adapted to harsh, dry conditions and is often found in crevices or on rock faces."
