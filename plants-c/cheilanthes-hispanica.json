    "intro": "Cheilanthes hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in Mediterranean climates. The plant has a short, thick rhizome with dense, clustered fronds that are leathery and dark green. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns. It is well adapted to dry environments and is often found in crevices or on rock faces."
