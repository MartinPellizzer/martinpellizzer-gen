    "intro": "Centaurea lydia, commonly known as Lydia's cornflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flower heads, which are surrounded by spiny, bristly leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread. Centaurea lydia is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
