    "intro": "Cyclosorus rostratus, commonly known as the rostrated water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically divided into four parts, resembling a cloverleaf shape. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures include tiny, spore-producing organs called sorus, which are located on the underside of the leaves. Cyclosorus rostratus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
