    "intro": "Caesalpinia corymbosa, commonly known as the flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its bright red or orange floral clusters, which resemble flames, and its compound leaves with small, oval leaflets. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain several seeds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, and it is drought-tolerant once established. The flame tree is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial in ecological restoration projects."
