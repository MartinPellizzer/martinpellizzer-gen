    "intro": "Cousinia simulatrix, commonly known as the false wormwood, is a flowering plant native to central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or arid environments. The plant features slender, hairy stems and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cousinia simulatrix is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
