    "intro": "Crataegus oxyacantha var. cremnicensis, commonly known as the Crimean hawthorn, is a rare and endemic species native to the Crimean Peninsula. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pinkish flowers in spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible but often contain seeds. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native region. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
