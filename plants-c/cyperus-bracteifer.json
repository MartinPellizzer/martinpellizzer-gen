It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a tight, cylindrical cluster. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are usually clustered at the tips of the stems. Cyperus bracteifer is often found in wet or moist soils, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
