    "intro": "Chondropetalum macrocarpum, commonly known as the giant horsetail, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that are covered in whorls of fertile and sterile branches. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are typical of its evolutionary lineage. Its leaves are reduced to scale-like structures, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This species is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
