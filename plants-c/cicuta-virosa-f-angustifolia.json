    "intro": "Cicuta virosa f. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved water hemlock, is a toxic member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and tall, hollow stems that often have a purple tinge. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters called umbels. It thrives in wet, disturbed soils along stream banks and in marshy areas. Due to its highly toxic sap and seeds, it is considered a dangerous plant that should be handled with care."
