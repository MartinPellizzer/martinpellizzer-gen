    "intro": "Cardamine jonselliana, commonly known as the Jonsell's watercress, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread gradually along the ground. The species is notable for its preference for calcareous soils and its role in supporting local insect populations."
