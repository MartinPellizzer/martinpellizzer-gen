    "intro": "Cotyledon semenovii, commonly known as the Semenov's cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Cotyledon semenovii requires well-draining soil and minimal watering to thrive."
