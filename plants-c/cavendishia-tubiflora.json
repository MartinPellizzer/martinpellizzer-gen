It is characterized by its vibrant yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, creating a dramatic visual display. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cavendishia tubiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
