    "intro": "Cakile lanceolata subsp. alacranensis, commonly known as the Mexican prickly cress, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its subspecies name, *alacranensis*, refers to its association with areas where scorpions (alacr\u00e1n) are common. This species plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying desert flora."
