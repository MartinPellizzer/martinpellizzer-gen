    "intro": "Ctenitis glabella, commonly known as the smooth frond fern, is a member of the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically smooth and uncreased. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology makes it a notable species in both horticultural and ecological contexts."
