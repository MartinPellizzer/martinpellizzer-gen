    "intro": "Cyrtomium aequibasis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorocarps, which are clustered at the base of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and garden cultivation."
