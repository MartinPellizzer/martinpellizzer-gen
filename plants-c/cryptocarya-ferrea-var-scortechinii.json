It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with dark, glossy foliage and a dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels and avocado trees, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
