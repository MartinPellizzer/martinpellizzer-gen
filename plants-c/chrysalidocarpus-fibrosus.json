    "intro": "Chrysalidocarpus fibrosus, commonly known as the fibrous screw pine, is a member of the Arecaceae family and is native to the Pacific Islands. It is a small to medium-sized palm characterized by its spirally arranged leaves and a slender, unbranched stem. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, round fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in coastal areas and is often used in traditional landscaping due to its ornamental value and salt tolerance. The fibrous screw pine is also valued for its hardy nature and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
