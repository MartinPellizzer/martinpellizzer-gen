    "intro": "Crescentia lethifera, commonly known as the deadly nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree with smooth, dark green leaves and produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range from white to purple. The plant is notable for its toxic berries, which contain tropane alkaloids such as atropine and scopolamine. These compounds have historically been used in traditional medicine and as a poison. Due to its toxicity, it is often considered a dangerous plant in both ecological and human contexts."
