    "intro": "Commiphora spinescens, commonly known as the African myrrh, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by distinctive, woody capsules containing aromatic resin. This resin, often referred to as myrrh, has been used traditionally for its medicinal and aromatic properties. Commiphora spinescens thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
