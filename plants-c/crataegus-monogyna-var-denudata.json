It is characterized by its smooth, often thornless stems and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with finely serrated margins, and turn red or orange in autumn. Its fruits are small, red berries that ripen in late summer and are an important food source for birds. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
