    "intro": "Cymbidiopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, featuring pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Cymbidiopsis has small, fleshy roots that help it absorb moisture from the air and rain. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
