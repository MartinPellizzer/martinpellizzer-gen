    "intro": "Cochlospermum wittei subsp. incanum, commonly known as the silverleaf cochlospermum, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its grayish-white, fuzzy leaves that give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Its small, woody fruits split open to release seeds, and the plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its unique foliage and vibrant floral display."
