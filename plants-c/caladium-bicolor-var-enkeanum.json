It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped leaves that come in shades of red, pink, and white, often with contrasting veins. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is typically grown as an annual in temperate regions due to its sensitivity to cold temperatures. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
