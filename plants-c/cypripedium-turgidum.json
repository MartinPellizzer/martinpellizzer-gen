    "intro": "Cypripedium turgidum, commonly known as the giant lady's slipper, is a striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky slopes. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. Cypripedium turgidum is a protected species due to habitat loss and over-collection."
