    "intro": "Crataegus linearis, commonly known as the slender hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched structure. The plant produces white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its leaves are elongated, lance-shaped, and have finely toothed margins, contributing to its ornamental value. Crataegus linearis is also valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
