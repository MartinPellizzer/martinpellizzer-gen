    "intro": "Ceratandra grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered spider-orchid, is a tropical orchid native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, spider-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink with a distinctive, elongated spur. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern. The orchid blooms during the dry season, producing fragrant flowers that attract specific pollinators such as bees and moths."
