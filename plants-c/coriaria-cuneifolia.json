It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are red berries that contain toxic seeds, making it important to handle with care. The plant is often found in coastal and moist woodland habitats."
