    "intro": "Centaurea cardanica, commonly known as the Cardan's centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bristly seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Centaurea cardanica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
