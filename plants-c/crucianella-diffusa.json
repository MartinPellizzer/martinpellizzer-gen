It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by water. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often growing in dune environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of coastal vegetation, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat diversity."
