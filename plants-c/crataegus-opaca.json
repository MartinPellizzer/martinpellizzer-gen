    "intro": "Crataegus opaca, commonly known as the American hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 feet, featuring thorny branches and dense, rounded foliage. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits called pomes. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated edges and a glossy upper surface. Crataegus opaca is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks, where it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
