    "intro": "Campanula divergens var. spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaf bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features striking bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped to spatulate leaves that are often covered in a fine, downy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
