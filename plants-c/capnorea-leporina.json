It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, pinkish-white flowers clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. The plant has delicate, hairy leaves that are often described as resembling a hare's foot, giving it its common name. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodland and grassland habitats. Capnorea leporina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
