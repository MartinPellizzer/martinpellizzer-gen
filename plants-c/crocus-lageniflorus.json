    "intro": "Crocus lageniflorus, commonly known as the giant crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter, typically in shades of yellow, orange, or red. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single flower per stem, which blooms in early spring. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The bulbs are toxic, so care should be taken when handling the plant."
