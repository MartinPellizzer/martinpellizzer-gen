    "intro": "Carex pediformis subsp. reventa, commonly known as the slender marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clumps with slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in spikelets that are clustered at the ends of its stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize wet areas effectively. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
