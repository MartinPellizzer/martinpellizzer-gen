    "intro": "Coelogyne malipoensis, commonly known as the Malipo orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in China, Vietnam, and Thailand. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its tropical and subtropical habitats. Coelogyne malipoensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
