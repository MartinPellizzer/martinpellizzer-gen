    "intro": "Cyperus commixtus, commonly known as the swamp arrowgrass, is a flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clusters of grass-like leaves. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, which are often surrounded by bracts. Cyperus commixtus is adapted to waterlogged conditions and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
