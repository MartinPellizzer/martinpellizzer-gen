    "intro": "Corybas finisterreanus, commonly known as the Southern Ghost Orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, hooded flower that resembles a ghostly face, with a distinctive white and green coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rainforest understoreys. It has a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, which is essential for its germination and growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
