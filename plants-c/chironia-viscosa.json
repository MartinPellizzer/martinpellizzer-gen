    "intro": "Chironia viscosa, commonly known as the sticky chironia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, hairy leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which can trap small insects. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. It thrives in humid environments and is often found in shaded, moist areas such as forests or along stream banks. Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study."
