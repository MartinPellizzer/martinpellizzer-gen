It is characterized by its hairy, linear leaves and small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this herbaceous perennial thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant's name refers to its leaf shape, which resembles a mouse's ear, and its flowering habit. It is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
