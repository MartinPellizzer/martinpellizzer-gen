    "intro": "Cynodon altior, commonly known as tall Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in warm climates and is often used for turfgrass due to its durability and rapid growth. Cynodon altior is also valued for its ability to withstand drought and heavy foot traffic."
