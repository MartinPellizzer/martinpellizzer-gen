    "intro": "Carex papillaticulmis, commonly known as the papillate sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to Central America and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats. Carex papillaticulmis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
