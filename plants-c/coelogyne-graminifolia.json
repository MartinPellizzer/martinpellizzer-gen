It is characterized by its long, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Coelogyne graminifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique floral display."
