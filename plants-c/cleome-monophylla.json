    "intro": "Cleome monophylla, commonly known as the yellow cleome, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom throughout the summer. The plant has palmate leaves with three to five lobes, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance ornamental plant. Cleome monophylla is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
