    "intro": "Chytroma praeclara, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and a distinctive bell-shaped flower that resembles a small horn. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the decomposing organic matter in the forest floor. Due to habitat loss, Chytroma praeclara is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
