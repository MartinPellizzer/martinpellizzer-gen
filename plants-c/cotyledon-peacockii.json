It is characterized by its striking, colorful leaves that resemble peacock feathers, with shades of pink, red, and orange. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It produces small, yellow flowers during the growing season, typically in spring or early summer. Cotyledon peacockii is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
