    "intro": "Castilleja parvula, commonly known as smallleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red, orange, or yellow flowers that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has modified stems that perform photosynthesis. It attaches to the roots of other plants to obtain water and nutrients, making it a partial parasite. Castilleja parvula thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges."
