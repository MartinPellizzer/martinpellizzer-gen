    "intro": "Carex brunnescens var. laetior, commonly known as the golden sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to eastern North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a vibrant golden-green color, which distinguishes it from other sedges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
