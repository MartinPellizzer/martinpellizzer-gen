It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads made up of many small florets. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a distinctive lobed shape, while the flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster.
