It is a clump-forming perennial plant characterized by its slender, hollow stems that grow in dense clusters. The plant produces inflorescences of small, spike-like clusters of flowers, which are typically greenish or pale yellow in color. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, with a smooth texture and a slightly glossy surface. Chusquea gamarrae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and resilience in cooler climates."
