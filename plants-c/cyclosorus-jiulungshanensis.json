    "intro": "Cyclosorus jiulungshanensis, commonly known as the Jiulungshan cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern endemic to China. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves with four lobes. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental degradation."
