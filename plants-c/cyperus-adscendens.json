    "intro": "Cyperus adscendens, commonly known as the zigzag sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, triangular stems that often curve in a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Cyperus adscendens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
