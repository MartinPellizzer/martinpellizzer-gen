    "intro": "Cecropia, commonly known as the \"arrow tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of the Americas and are characterized by their rapid growth and distinctive, large, palmate leaves. Cecropia species often have hollow stems that provide shelter for various animals, including azara and leafcutter ants. They are also notable for their ability to form symbiotic relationships with certain fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The plant's unique morphology and ecological significance make it an important component of tropical ecosystems."
