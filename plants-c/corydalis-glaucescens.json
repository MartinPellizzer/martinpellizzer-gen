    "intro": "Corydalis glaucescens, commonly known as the blue poppy, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western China. It features delicate, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the tips of its stems. The plant has slender, hairy leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Corydalis glaucescens is valued in horticulture for its attractive foliage and showy flowers, though it is somewhat challenging to cultivate outside its native habitat."
