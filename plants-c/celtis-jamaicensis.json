    "intro": "Celtis jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican hackberry, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the Elm family (Ulmaceae) and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by spherical, smooth fruits that are typically eaten by birds and small mammals. Celtis jamaicensis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Its ecological importance lies in providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
