    "intro": "Clidemia coccinea, commonly known as red-leaved false hibiscus, is a species of flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its striking red foliage and showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as tropical forests and is often found in disturbed or secondary growth areas. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a velvety texture, while the flowers are borne in clusters at the base of the plant. Clidemia coccinea is also known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it an invasive species in some regions."
