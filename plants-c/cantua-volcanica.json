    "intro": "Cantua volcanica, commonly known as the volcano bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, soft hair, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Cantua volcanica is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climate conditions."
