    "intro": "Calochlaena dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the humid air. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Calochlaena dubia is considered vulnerable and is protected in its native range."
