    "intro": "Cyperus tenuis var. aximensis, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. Its slender stems are often hairy, and it produces small, three-ranked spikelets that are characteristic of the sedge family. Cyperus tenuis var. aximensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
