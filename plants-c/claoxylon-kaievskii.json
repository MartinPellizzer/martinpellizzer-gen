    "intro": "Claoxylon kaievskii, commonly known as the Kaimanawa tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish flowers that are typically followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is often found in coastal and lowland forest environments, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Claoxylon kaievskii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
