    "intro": "Cheilanthes lozanoi, commonly known as the Lozano's rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a terrestrial, epiphytic, or lithophytic plant, typically found growing on rocks or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a compact rosette of lanceolate, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes. It produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. Cheilanthes lozanoi is adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
