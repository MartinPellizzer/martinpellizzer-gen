    "intro": "Castilleja miniata var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish-orange flowers and slender, often hairy stems. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor environments. Its hemiparasitic nature allows it to derive some nutrients from neighboring plants through specialized root structures. Castilleja miniata var. alpina plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host for certain fungi and insects."
