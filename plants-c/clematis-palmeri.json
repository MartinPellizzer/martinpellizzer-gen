    "intro": "Clematis palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's clematis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial vine characterized by its woody stems and palmately compound leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of blue and purple during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
