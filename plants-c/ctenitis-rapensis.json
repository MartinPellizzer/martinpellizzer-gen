    "intro": "Ctenitis rapensis, commonly known as the red-tailed fern, is a rare and unique species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often tinged with red at the base. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its spores are released in a specialized structure called a sorus, which is typically located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ctenitis rapensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
