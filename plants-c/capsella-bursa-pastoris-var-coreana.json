It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its seeds are encased in a distinctive bur-like structure, which aids in seed dispersal. The botanical features of this variant make it well-adapted to a variety of environmental conditions."
