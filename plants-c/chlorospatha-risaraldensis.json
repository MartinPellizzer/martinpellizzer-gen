    "intro": "Chlorospatha risaraldensis, commonly known as the Risaralda green fern, is a unique species native to the Andean region of Colombia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically a vibrant green. The plant exhibits a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new shoots along their length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
