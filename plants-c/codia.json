    "intro": "Codia, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical Africa. These plants are characterized by their rosettes of velvety, waxy leaves and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. Codia species are typically compact, making them popular houseplants due to their ability to thrive in indoor environments. They prefer bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The genus includes several species, such as Codia natalensis and Codia rutilans, which are prized for their ornamental value."
