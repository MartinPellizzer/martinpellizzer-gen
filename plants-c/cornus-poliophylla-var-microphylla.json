    "intro": "Cornus poliophylla var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf cornus or small-leaf cornus, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically 1 to 2 inches in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers in late spring, which are followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use in small gardens or as a border plant. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
