    "intro": "Cynanchum cordifolium, commonly known as the heart-leaved milkweed, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
