    "intro": "Cassia hymenaeifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf cassia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in a fine, silky pubescence, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical spikes, which are typical of the legume family. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release small, brown seeds. Cassia hymenaeifolia is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
