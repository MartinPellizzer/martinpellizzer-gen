    "intro": "Caroxylon micrantherum, commonly known as the small-flowered caroxylon, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Cactaceae, which includes cacti and related succulent plants. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or orange. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its water-storing tissues. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
