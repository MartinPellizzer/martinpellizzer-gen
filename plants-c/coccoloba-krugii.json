    "intro": "Coccoloba krugii, commonly known as the Krug's beautyberry, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, typically found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. It produces small, fleshy berries that are often eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
