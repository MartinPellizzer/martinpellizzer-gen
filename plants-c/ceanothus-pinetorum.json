    "intro": "Ceanothus pinetorum, commonly known as the coastal ceanothus, is a shrub native to the western United States, particularly along coastal areas. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of leathery, dark green leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ceanothus pinetorum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
