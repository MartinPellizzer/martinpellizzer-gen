The plant produces small, inconspicuous cones and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile choice for horticultural use. Its compact form and elegant appearance make it a popular specimen plant in both formal and naturalistic settings."
