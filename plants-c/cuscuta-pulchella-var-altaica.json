    "intro": "Cuscuta pulchella var. altaica, commonly known as the tall dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, inconspicuous white or yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants. The plant is native to temperate regions of Asia and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or damage its host plants, making it a potential agricultural weed."
