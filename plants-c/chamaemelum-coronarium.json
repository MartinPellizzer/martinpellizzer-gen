    "intro": "Chamaemelum coronarium, commonly known as buttonweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, daisy-like yellow flowers with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, and it grows in clusters at the base of the plant. The leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often have a slightly bitter taste. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar composite flower structures."
