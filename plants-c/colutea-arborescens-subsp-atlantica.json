    "intro": "Colutea arborescens subsp. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic broomrape, is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially depends on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. The plant is characterized by its yellow flowers and lacks true leaves, relying instead on modified stems for photosynthesis. It is native to the Iberian Peninsula and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
