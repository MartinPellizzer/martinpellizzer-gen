    "intro": "Carduus erosus, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with serrated edges, and the plant produces achenes that are dispersed by wind. Carduus erosus is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
