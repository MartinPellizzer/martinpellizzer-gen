    "intro": "Carex spicata subsp. spicata, commonly known as the spike sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces tall, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, three-lobed flowers. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
