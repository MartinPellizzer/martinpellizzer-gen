    "intro": "Cytisus divaricatus, commonly known as the creeping firethorn, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or low-growing bushes. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and trifoliate, with a distinctive silvery underside. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and open woodlands."
