    "intro": "Collabium chapaense, commonly known as the Chapa mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue petals. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine pubescence, while its stems are upright and branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Collabium chapaense is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
