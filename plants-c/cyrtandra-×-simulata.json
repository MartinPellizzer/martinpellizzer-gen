    "intro": "Cyrtandra \u00d7 simulata, commonly known as the hybrid Cyrtandra, is a flowering plant belonging to the Gesneriaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Cyrtandra corymbosa and Cyrtandra pedata, characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, in tropical and subtropical regions. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture, though it is primarily found in the wild."
