    "intro": "Cynoglossum vanense, commonly known as Van's tongue-shaped flower, is a flowering plant belonging to the Boraginaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in Kazakhstan and the Tien Shan mountains. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts."
