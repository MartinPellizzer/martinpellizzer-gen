    "intro": "Carlina vulgaris f. humillima, commonly known as the dwarf hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically features hairy stems and basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
