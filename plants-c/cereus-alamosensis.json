    "intro": "Cereus alamosensis, commonly known as the Alamos night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive ribbed stem and spines that help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Its unique blooming pattern and striking appearance make it a notable species in desert botany."
