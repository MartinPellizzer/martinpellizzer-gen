    "intro": "Cyathea dilatata, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, upright trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in humid, tropical environments. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent at night, which aids in attracting pollinators. The plant plays an important role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling."
