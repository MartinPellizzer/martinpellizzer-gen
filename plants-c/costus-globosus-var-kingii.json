    "intro": "Costus globosus var. kingii, commonly known as the King's costus, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features tall, slender stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces showy, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by colorful bracts, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
