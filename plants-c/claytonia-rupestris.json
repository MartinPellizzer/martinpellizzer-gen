    "intro": "Claytonia rupestris, commonly known as the Sierra stonecrop, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. It is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and full sun exposure. Claytonia rupestris is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
