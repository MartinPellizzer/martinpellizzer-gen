    "intro": "Cyperus swartzii, commonly known as the swamp cyperus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by water or wind. Cyperus swartzii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
