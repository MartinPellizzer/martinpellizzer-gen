    "intro": "Chamaedrys, commonly known as mountain geranium, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Geraniaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have alternate, simple, and often hairy leaves, and their flowers are usually pink, red, or white, arranged in clusters. They are adapted to grow in rocky or well-drained soils, often in alpine or forested areas. Chamaedrys species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
