    "intro": "Cotoneaster hjelmqvistii, commonly known as the Hjelmqvist cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features small, glossy, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that persist into winter. It is valued for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Cotoneaster hjelmqvistii is often used in landscaping for its compact growth habit and seasonal interest."
