    "intro": "Cephalocereus bahamensis, commonly known as the Bahamian hedgehog cactus, is a columnar cactus native to the Bahamas. It features a tall, spiny stem with clusters of white flowers that bloom at night. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its spines are modified leaves, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss. It is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in coastal areas."
