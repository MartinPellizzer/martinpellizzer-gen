    "intro": "Corytholoma atrosanguineum, commonly known as the black blood mushroom, is a species of bracket fungus that grows on dead wood in forested areas. It has a distinctive, irregularly shaped cap that is typically dark brown to black in color. The stem is short and thick, often covered in fine, fibrous scales. The fruiting body is usually found attached to the base of fallen trees, and it plays a role in decomposing organic matter. This mushroom is not considered edible and is often mistaken for other similar species due to its dark coloration."
