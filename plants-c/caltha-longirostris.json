    "intro": "Caltha longirostris, commonly known as the long-beaked buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers with five sepals and numerous stamens. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream sides and forest floors. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Caltha longirostris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
