    "intro": "Canavalia villosa var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems that are less prominent in this variant compared to the typical form. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often cultivated for its edible beans, which are rich in protein and nutrients. The smooth cowpea is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a useful plant in sustainable agriculture."
