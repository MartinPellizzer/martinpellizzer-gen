It is characterized by its smooth, gray-brown bark and dense, spreading canopy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into long, clustered pods containing edible, reddish-brown seeds. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the use of its seeds in traditional medicine and cuisine."
