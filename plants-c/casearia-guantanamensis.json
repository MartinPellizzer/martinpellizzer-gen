It belongs to the family Salicaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by elliptical berries that mature to a dark red or black color. It is often found in moist, shaded areas of forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential ecological role in its native habitat."
