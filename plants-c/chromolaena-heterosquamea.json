    "intro": "Chromolaena heterosquamea, commonly known as the yellow crazy ant plant, is a flowering shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings due to its adaptability. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
