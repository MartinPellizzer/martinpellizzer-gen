    "intro": "Carex lepida, commonly known as the silver sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically brown or green in color, arranged in spikelets. Carex lepida thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective ground cover and a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
