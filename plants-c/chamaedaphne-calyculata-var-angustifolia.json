    "intro": "Chamaedaphne calyculata var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf leatherleaf, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, urn-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic soils along the edges of bogs and swamps, where it forms dense, shrub-like colonies. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often reddish underside. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions, contributing to the ecological stability of its wetland habitats."
