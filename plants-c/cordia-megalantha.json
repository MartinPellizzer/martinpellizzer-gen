    "intro": "Cordia megalantha, commonly known as the large-leaved cordia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, ovate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, inflated, orange-red fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Cordia megalantha thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland tropical forests."
