    "intro": "Cassine confertiflora, commonly known as the clustered cassine, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Cassine confertiflora is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as riverbanks and forest understories."
