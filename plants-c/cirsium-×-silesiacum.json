It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flower heads that resemble those of other thistle species. Native to Central Europe, this plant thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Its botanical features include a robust stem and a composite flower structure composed of both ray and disk florets. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
