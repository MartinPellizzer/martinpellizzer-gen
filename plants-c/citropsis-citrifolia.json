    "intro": "Citropsis citrifolia, commonly known as the white mulberry, is a deciduous tree native to Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically lobed and have a silvery underside. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by fleshy, pinkish berries that ripen to a deep red. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it has a shallow root system that makes it adaptable to various soil types. The plant is often cultivated for its fruit, which is used in traditional medicine and as a food source for silkworms."
