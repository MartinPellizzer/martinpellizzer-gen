    "intro": "Chorizanthe ramosissima, commonly known as desert star or desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and sagebrush steppe. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers, which are often pink or red, bloom in late spring to early summer."
