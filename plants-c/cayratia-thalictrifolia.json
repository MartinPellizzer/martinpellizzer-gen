It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces bright yellow berries that are edible when ripe, though they are typically consumed by birds rather than humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a unique and attractive climbing plant."
