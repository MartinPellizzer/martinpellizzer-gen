    "intro": "Chiloschista, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. The plants typically produce showy, often brightly colored flowers that bloom in summer. Chiloschista species are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where they grow on rocky substrates. Due to their specialized habitat requirements, they are often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure their survival."
