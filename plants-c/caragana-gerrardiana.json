    "intro": "Caragana gerrardiana, commonly known as the Siberian peashrub, is a deciduous shrub native to the cold climates of Central Asia and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically made up of 10 to 20 pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, followed by small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in poor, sandy soils. Caragana gerrardiana is often used in reclamation projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
