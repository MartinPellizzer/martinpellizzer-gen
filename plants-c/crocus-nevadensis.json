    "intro": "Crocus nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It produces showy, early spring blooms with bright yellow petals and a distinctive, often recurved shape. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are grass-like and narrow, and it is often found in open meadows and along mountain trails. The Sierra crocus is an important part of the local ecosystem, providing nectar for early pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
