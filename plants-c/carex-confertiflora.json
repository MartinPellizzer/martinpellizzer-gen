    "intro": "Carex confertiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are usually greenish or brownish, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Carex confertiflora plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
