    "intro": "Cereus humboldtii, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a flowering cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and its ability to produce large, fragrant white flowers at night. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Its flowers open only during the evening and close by dawn, a unique adaptation to attract nocturnal pollinators. The species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its striking, ephemeral blooms."
