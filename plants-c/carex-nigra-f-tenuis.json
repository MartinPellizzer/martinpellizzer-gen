It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, dark brown to black flowers. This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more slender foliage compared to the typical Carex nigra. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland habitats."
