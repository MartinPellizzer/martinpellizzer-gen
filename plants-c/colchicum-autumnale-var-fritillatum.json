    "intro": "Colchicum autumnale var. fritillatum, commonly known as the autumn crocus or meadow saffron, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically basal and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of corms, which are modified underground stems used for storage and propagation. The plant is also known for its toxic properties, containing colchicine, a compound used in medicine but dangerous in high doses."
