    "intro": "Centropogon flos-mutisii f. haticensis, commonly known as the Haticense centropogon, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its foliage consists of lance-shaped leaves with a velvety texture, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
