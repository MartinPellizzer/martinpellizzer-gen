    "intro": "Carex aperta var. divaricata, commonly known as the broadleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often hidden among the foliage, making it less showy than some other sedges. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
