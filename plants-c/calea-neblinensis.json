It is characterized by its striking, showy white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Calea neblinensis is also noted for its aromatic foliage, which emits a subtle, sweet scent."
