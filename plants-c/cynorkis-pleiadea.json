    "intro": "Cynorkis pleiadea, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, velvety flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white. Its leaves are thick, fleshy, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture. Cynorkis pleiadea is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
