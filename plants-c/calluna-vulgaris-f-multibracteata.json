    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris f. multibracteata, commonly known as the many-bract heather, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant features narrow, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in whorls around the stems. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and moorland environments. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to create a ground cover in shady, moist garden settings."
