It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
