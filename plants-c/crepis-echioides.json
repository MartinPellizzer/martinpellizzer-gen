The plant produces small, yellow flower heads that develop into achene fruits, typical of the sunflower family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. Crepis echioides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in various environmental conditions."
