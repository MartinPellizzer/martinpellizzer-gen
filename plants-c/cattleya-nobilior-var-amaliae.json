    "intro": "Cattleya nobilior var. amaliae, commonly known as Amalia's Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid prized for its vibrant, fragrant flowers. It features large, showy blooms with a mix of pink and white hues, often with a contrasting lip. The plant is a sympodial orchid, meaning it grows in clusters with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
