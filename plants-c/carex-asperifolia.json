    "intro": "Carex asperifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves that are rough to the touch due to the presence of stiff, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically clustered at the tips of its stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats. Carex asperifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
