    "intro": "Conoclinium palustre, commonly known as swamp honeysuckle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the wetlands of North America. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy and have a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. These flowers are adapted to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Conoclinium palustre thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks."
