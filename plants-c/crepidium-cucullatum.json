    "intro": "Crepidium cucullatum, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, hood-like flower structure that encloses the reproductive organs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers during the spring. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its distinctive floral morphology."
