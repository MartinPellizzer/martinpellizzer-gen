    "intro": "Crepidium koordersii var. celebense, commonly known as the Celebes bog orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its terrestrial growth habit and is typically found in swampy or wetland habitats. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense spike, which are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, spongy sheath that aids in water retention. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
