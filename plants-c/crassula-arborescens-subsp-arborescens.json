    "intro": "Crassula arborescens subsp. arborescens, commonly known as the tree crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact, tree-like structure with thick, fleshy leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its drought tolerance and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
