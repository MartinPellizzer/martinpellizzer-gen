It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red or orange berries that are edible for birds.

Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in cooler regions."
