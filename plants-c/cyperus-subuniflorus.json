Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in wetland environments such as marshes and along water bodies. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its botanical features make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems and a subject of study in wetland botany."
