    "intro": "Cherleria biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered cherleria, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within its native range."
