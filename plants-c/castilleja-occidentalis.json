    "intro": "Castilleja occidentalis, commonly known as western paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking red to orange tubular flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for water and nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and meadows. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important species in its native ecosystem."
