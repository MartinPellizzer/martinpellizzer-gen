    "intro": "Calamus loherianus, commonly known as the Loherian reed, is a member of the Aroid family (Araceae). It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its tall, slender stems and broad, arrow-shaped leaves. Native to the wetlands and marshy areas of Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers enclosed in a spathe, typical of the Aroid family. It is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in aquatic gardens."
