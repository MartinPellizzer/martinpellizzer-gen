    "intro": "Chrysobalanus interior, commonly known as the white beach almond, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elongated, elliptical leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, almond-like seeds enclosed in a fleshy, red or yellow pseudaril. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found in mangrove ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
