    "intro": "Cordia correae, commonly known as the red cedar or Brazilian cedar, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its rough, fissured bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. Its fruit is an important food source for various bird species, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat. The wood of Cordia correae is lightweight and has been traditionally used for construction and furniture-making."
