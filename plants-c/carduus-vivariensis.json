    "intro": "Carduus vivariensis, commonly known as the common thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in grasslands. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which contribute to its prickly texture. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, making it a common weed in many regions."
