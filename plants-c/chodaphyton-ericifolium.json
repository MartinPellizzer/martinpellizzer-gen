    "intro": "Chodaphyton ericifolium, commonly known as the heath bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern hemisphere. It typically thrives in acidic, well-drained soils found in heathlands and moorlands. The plant features small, needle-like leaves and produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters. It is often found in open, sunny habitats and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species of undisturbed habitats."
