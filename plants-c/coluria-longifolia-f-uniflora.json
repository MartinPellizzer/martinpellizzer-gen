    "intro": "Coluria longifolia f. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used for trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its flowers are usually solitary, hence the subspecific name *uniflora*, and are often yellow or greenish in color. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
