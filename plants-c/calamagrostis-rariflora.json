    "intro": "Calamagrostis rariflora, commonly known as slender tussock grass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and panicles of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its foliage is often bluish-green, and it forms dense tussocks that provide habitat for various wildlife. Calamagrostis rariflora is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and support biodiversity."
