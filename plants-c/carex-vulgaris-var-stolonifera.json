    "intro": "Carex vulgaris var. stolonifera, commonly known as the common sedge, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage, with narrow, erect leaves that form dense clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, typically arranged in a cylindrical inflorescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is notable for its stoloniferous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively and form extensive colonies."
