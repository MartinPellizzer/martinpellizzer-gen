It belongs to the family Cephalomanesaceae and is notable for its specialized morphology, featuring a central stem with radiating, leaf-like structures. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and thrives in specific, often shaded, moist environments. Its botanical significance lies in its unusual form and potential ecological role in niche habitats. Further research is needed to fully understand its reproductive biology and conservation status."
