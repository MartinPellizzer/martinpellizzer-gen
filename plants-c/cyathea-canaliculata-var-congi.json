    "intro": "Cyathea canaliculata var. congi, commonly known as the narrow-veined tree fern, is a tropical species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and indoor cultivation."
