    "intro": "Chupalon strobiliferum, commonly known as the mountain cedar, is a deciduous tree native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and produces catkin-like inflorescences that are wind-pollinated. The tree is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against extreme temperatures and wildfires. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
