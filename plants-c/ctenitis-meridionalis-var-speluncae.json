    "intro": "Ctenitis meridionalis var. speluncae, commonly known as the cave fern, is a rare and specialized fern species adapted to dark, humid environments. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lobed fronds that thrive in low-light conditions. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in crevices within caves, relying on moisture from the air rather than direct sunlight. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an important indicator of subterranean ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and specific requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
