    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 aurantium var. bigaradia, commonly known as the bitter orange, is a citrus species native to Asia and widely cultivated for its fruit and ornamental value. It is characterized by its thick, peels that contain a high concentration of essential oils, contributing to its strong aroma and medicinal properties. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, featuring glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant white flowers. Its fruit, which is generally not consumed raw due to its bitter taste, is used in marmalades, perfumes, and traditional medicine.
