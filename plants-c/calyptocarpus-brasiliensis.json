    "intro": "Calyptocarpus brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian water lily, is a aquatic plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its floating leaves and showy, spadix-bearing inflorescences. The plant has a short, thick rhizome that anchors it in shallow water, and its leaves are broad and rounded with a waxy surface. Calyptocarpus brasiliensis thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often found in ponds and lakes. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers on separate plants, and it plays a role in supporting aquatic ecosystems."
