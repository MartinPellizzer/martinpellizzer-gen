    "intro": "Coffea maclaudii, commonly known as the Maclaud's coffee. It is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family, native to Madagascar. The plant is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits. The seeds within the fruits are used to make coffee, though it is not as widely cultivated as other coffee species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
