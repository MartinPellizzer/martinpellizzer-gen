It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that often display vibrant colors ranging from green to red and orange. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
