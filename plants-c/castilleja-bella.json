    "intro": "Castilleja bella, commonly known as the beautiful castilleja, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, red-orange or yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its leaves are small and opposite, and it has a distinctive appearance with its bright, tubular flowers."
