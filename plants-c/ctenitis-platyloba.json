    "intro": "Ctenitis platyloba, commonly known as the broad-lobed ctenophyll, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with broad, lobed segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity. Its spores are dispersed through wind, and the fronds are often used in traditional medicine in its native regions. The botanical features of Ctenitis platyloba make it an important species for both ecological and ethnobotanical studies."
