    "intro": "Coincya hispida subsp. transtagana, commonly known as the Transcaucasian water clover, is a aquatic plant characterized by its intricate network of fine, thread-like leaves that form a dense, floating mat on the water surface. It is native to the freshwater regions of the Caucasus, including parts of Georgia and Azerbaijan. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving waters with soft, nutrient-rich substrates. Its leaves are covered in tiny, hair-like structures that aid in water retention and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. Coincya hispida subsp. transtagana is often used in pond ecosystems to improve water clarity and support biodiversity."
