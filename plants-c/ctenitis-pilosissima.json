    "intro": "Ctenitis pilosissima, commonly known as the hairy sea holly, is a marine plant belonging to the family Zosteraceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth and is typically found in intertidal zones. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss. It plays an important role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for small marine organisms. Ctenitis pilosissima is often found in association with other seagrasses in shallow coastal waters."
