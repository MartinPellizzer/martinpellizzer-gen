    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris pergrossa, commonly known as the greater shepherd's purse, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive triangular seed pods that resemble a purse, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm and has alternate, pinnately lobed leaves. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. This species is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
