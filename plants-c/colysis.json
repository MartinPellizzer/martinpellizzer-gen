    "intro": "Colysis, commonly known as the common coltsfoot, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves and a flowering head that appears in early spring. The plant produces yellow composite flowers, which are actually made up of many tiny florets. Colysis is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in moist, shady environments. It has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
