    "intro": "Cotyledon hemisphaerica, commonly known as the African snowball, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, thick leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that resemble snowballs, blooming in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically rounded and may have a slight bluish or purple tint. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
