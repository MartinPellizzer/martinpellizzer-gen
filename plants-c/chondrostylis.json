It is a rare and delicate plant that typically grows on tree trunks or branches, known as an epiphyte. The plant has a unique appearance with a single, showy white or pale pink flower that resembles a ghostly figure. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions."
