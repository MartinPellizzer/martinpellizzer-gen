    "intro": "Campanula subulata, commonly known as the needleleaf bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, needle-like leaves that are tightly clustered at the base, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Campanula subulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
