    "intro": "Carex pulla var. miliaris, commonly known as the silver sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, bogs, and wet meadows, and is often found in temperate regions. Its leaves are narrow, glabrous, and have a silvery-blue hue due to the presence of dense, fine hairs. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
