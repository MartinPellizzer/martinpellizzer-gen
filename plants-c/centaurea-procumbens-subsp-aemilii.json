    "intro": "Centaurea procumbens subsp. aemilii, commonly known as the Emilian spreading centaury, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces bright blue to purple composite flowers with distinctive central disk flowers surrounded by ray florets. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
