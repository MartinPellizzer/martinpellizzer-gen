    "intro": "Coreopsis reptans, commonly known as creeping coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial that produces bright yellow to orange flowers in early spring. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
