    "intro": "Ceradenia tryoniorum, commonly known as the Tryon's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean region of South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments within cloud forests. The plant features a slender, upright stem with several lance-shaped leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its flowers are characterized by their intricate structure, including a spurred lip that is unique to the genus Ceradenia. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ceradenia tryoniorum is considered a rare and endangered species."
