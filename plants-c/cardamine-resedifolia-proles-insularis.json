    "intro": "Cardamine resedifolia proles insularis, commonly known as the island water shield, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions of Europe. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes, where it anchors itself to submerged or floating substrates. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette formation, allowing it to maximize light absorption in low-light conditions. Its small, white flowers bloom in early summer, contributing to its role in supporting local pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
