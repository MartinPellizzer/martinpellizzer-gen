    "intro": "Carissa acuminata, commonly known as the yellow bell bush, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, featuring glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces small, round, yellow berries that are edible when ripe but have a bitter taste. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. Carissa acuminata is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dye."
