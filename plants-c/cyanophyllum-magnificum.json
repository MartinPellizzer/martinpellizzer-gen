    "intro": "Cyanophyllum magnificum, commonly known as the radiant bluebloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, deep blue petals that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to conserve moisture in its cool, humid environment. Its flowers bloom only during the full moon, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is considered a keystone species in its ecosystem."
