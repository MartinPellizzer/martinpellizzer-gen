    "intro": "Correa reflexa, commonly known as the Narrow-leaf Correa, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are narrow and glossy, often with a slight curl, and they are arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. This plant is also valued for its attractive foliage and long flowering period, typically from late winter to early spring."
