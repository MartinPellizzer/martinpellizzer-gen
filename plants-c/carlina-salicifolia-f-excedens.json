    "intro": "Carlina salicifolia f. excedens, commonly known as the tall leaf carline thistle, is a variant of the carline thistle species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flower heads that are surrounded by bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This form is notable for its increased height compared to the typical form of Carlina salicifolia."
