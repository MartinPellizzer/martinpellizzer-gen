    "intro": "Cynanchum stipitatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers with a distinctive corolla that resembles a shield, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Despite its ornamental appeal, it contains toxic compounds and is not typically cultivated for agricultural purposes."
