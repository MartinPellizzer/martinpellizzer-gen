    "intro": "Cestrum foetidum, commonly known as the stinking nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, elliptic leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals."
