    "intro": "Carex lenaensis, commonly known as Lena's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex lenaensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
