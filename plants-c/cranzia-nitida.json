    "intro": "Cranzia nitida, commonly known as the glossy cranza, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, silky hairs that give it a distinctive, almost velvety appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale blue, arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a glossy, waxy surface that reflects light. Cranzia nitida is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun."
