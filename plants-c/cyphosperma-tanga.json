    "intro": "Cyphosperma tanga, commonly known as the Tanga cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically growing on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. Cyphosperma tanga is native to the rainforests of New Guinea and is adapted to humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
