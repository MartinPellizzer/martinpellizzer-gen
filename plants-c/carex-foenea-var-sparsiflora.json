    "intro": "Carex foenea var. sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a distinct midrib, and the stems are often upright. This variety is noted for its sparse flowering pattern, which distinguishes it from other Carex species."
