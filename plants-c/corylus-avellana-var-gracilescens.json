    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. gracilescens, commonly known as the slender hazel, is a variant of the common hazel native to Europe and western Asia. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its slender, arching branches and small, oval leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces catkin-like male flowers and female flowers in separate clusters, followed by edible hazelnuts. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
