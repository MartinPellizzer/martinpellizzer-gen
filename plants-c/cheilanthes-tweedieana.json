It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows on rocky outcrops and in sandy soils. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with dense clusters of lanceolate, leathery leaves that are dark green in color. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered near the margins. This species is adapted to survive in harsh environments, showcasing drought tolerance and efficient water retention mechanisms."
