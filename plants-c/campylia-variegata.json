    "intro": "Campylia variegata, commonly known as the variegated campylia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage with shades of green, white, and yellow. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Campylia variegata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying properties."
