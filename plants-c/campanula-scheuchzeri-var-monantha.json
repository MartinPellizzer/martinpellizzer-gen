    "intro": "Campanula scheuchzeri var. monantha, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The leaves are lanceolate and hairy, adapted to withstand cold and windy conditions. This variety is distinguished by its single-flowered inflorescences, unlike the typical clustered flowers of other campanula species. It thrives in rocky or meadow habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in alpine gardens."
