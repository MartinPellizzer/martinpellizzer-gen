    "intro": "Campyloneurum polyanthum, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and its distinctive, bright yellow to orange spore-bearing structures called sorus. The fronds are typically short and stout, with a glossy, dark green coloration that contrasts beautifully with the vibrant spores. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of care in suitable conditions."
