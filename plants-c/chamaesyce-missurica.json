    "intro": "Chamaesyce missurica, commonly known as the Missouri sandplant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the central United States. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and prairies. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are inconspicuous, appearing in clusters and blooming in the early spring. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
