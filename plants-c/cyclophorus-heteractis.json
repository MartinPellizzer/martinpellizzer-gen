    "intro": "Cyclophorus heteractis, commonly known as the spiral liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its structure consists of a thallus with a central axis and spirally arranged leaf-like structures called phyllodes. Cyclophorus heteractis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms."
