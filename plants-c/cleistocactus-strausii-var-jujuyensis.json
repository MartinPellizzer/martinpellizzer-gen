    "intro": "Cleistocactus strausii var. jujuyensis, commonly known as the Jujuy cactus, is a species native to the Andean region of South America. It is a small, globular cactus with a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, a characteristic feature of its nocturnal pollination strategy. Its spines are short and dense, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss. This variety is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
