It is characterized by its small, white or pinkish flowers and hairy stems and leaves. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, and its flowers are arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems.
