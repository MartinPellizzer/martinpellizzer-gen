    "intro": "Cuscuta xanthonema, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, thread-like stem that wraps around its host. The plant is native to various regions in Asia and is often found on crops like rice and soybean. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops. Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a weed in many agricultural settings."
