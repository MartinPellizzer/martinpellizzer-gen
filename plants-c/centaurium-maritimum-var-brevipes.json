    "intro": "Centaurium maritimum var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed sea centaury, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, where it is adapted to salty and windy conditions. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the stems are short and compact, which helps it resist erosion and conserve moisture. This variety is often found in maritime habitats and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
