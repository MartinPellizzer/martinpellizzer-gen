    "intro": "Croton elaeagni var. antsingyensis, commonly known as the Madagascar croton, is a shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color, followed by distinctive, spiny fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
