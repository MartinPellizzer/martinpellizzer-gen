    "intro": "Chaenorhinum origanifolium subsp. cotiellae, commonly known as the narrow-leafed stickseed, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, often resembling those of oregano, hence part of its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. This subspecies is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
