    "intro": "Ciliaria bryoides, commonly known as the moss-like liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its small, leafy structure that resembles moss, with closely packed, overlapping leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on stalks and release spores for dispersal. Ciliaria bryoides plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
