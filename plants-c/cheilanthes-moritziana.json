    "intro": "Cheilanthes moritziana, commonly known as the Moritz's rockcap, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white to brownish hairs. The plant is typically found growing on rocky outcrops or in crevices, where it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. Its spores are released from the underside of the fronds, which are usually clustered in a tight, cushion-like formation. This fern is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and resilient species."
