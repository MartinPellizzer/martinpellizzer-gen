    "intro": "Carex brotherorum, commonly known as the Brother's sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to the eastern United States and is typically found in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually green to brown in color. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. Carex brotherorum is a perennial herb that thrives in full to partial sunlight and requires consistent moisture for optimal growth."
