    "intro": "Capsicum maculatum, commonly known as the ornamental pepper or spotted nightshade, is a tropical flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful fruits that range from red, yellow, orange, and even purple. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are followed by the showy, often mottled fruits. Its leaves are broad and lobed, with a slightly hairy texture. Capsicum maculatum is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for culinary use."
