It is a small, herbaceous plant with a single, slender stem that bears a few lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a loose inflorescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires a cool climate to bloom. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
