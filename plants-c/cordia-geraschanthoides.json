    "intro": "Cordia geraschanthoides, commonly known as the red-flowered cordia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically red or pink, clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruit is a fleshy, berry-like capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds. Cordia geraschanthoides is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils."
