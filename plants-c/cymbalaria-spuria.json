    "intro": "Cymbalaria spuria, commonly known as the common bedstraw, is a flowering plant in the family Primulaceae. It is a low-growing annual or perennial herb characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Cymbalaria spuria is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, making it a common weed in various regions."
