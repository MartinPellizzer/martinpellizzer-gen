    "intro": "Carex quadrifida var. caeca, commonly known as the blind sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The varietal form 'caeca' is distinguished by its reduced or absent flowering structures, giving it a unique appearance compared to other Carex species."
