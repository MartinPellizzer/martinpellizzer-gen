    "intro": "Cenchrus rigidus, commonly known as rigid grass or sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its stiff, upright growth habit and narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which contain numerous tiny seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive drought conditions. Cenchrus rigidus is often found in sandy soils and is used in erosion control due to its hardy nature."
