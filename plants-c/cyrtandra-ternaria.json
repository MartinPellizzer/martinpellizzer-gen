It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its striking, bird-of-paradise-like inflorescences, which consist of brightly colored bracts surrounding clusters of small, tubular flowers. Cyrtandra ternaria typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
