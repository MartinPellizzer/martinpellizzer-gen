    "intro": "Cucumis amarus, commonly known as bitter cucumber, is a species of flowering plant in the Cucurbitaceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Africa, and it is characterized by its spiny, bitter-tasting fruits. The plant typically grows as a climbing vine with palmate leaves and yellow flowers. Its fruit is small, oval-shaped, and has a rough, textured exterior. Despite its bitterness, it has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
