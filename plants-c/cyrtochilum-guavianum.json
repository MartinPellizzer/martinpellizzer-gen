    "intro": "Cyrtochilum guavianum, commonly known as the Guianan slipper orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spurred pouch-like structure at the base of its flower, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Cyrtochilum guavianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat."
