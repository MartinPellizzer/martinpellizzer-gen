    "intro": "Cypripedium dickinsonianum, commonly known as the Dickinson's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is adapted to trap pollinators. The plant typically grows in cool, moist forest understories, thriving in shaded environments with rich, humusy soil. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
