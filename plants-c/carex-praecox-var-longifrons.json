    "intro": "Carex praecox var. longifrons, commonly known as the early sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, rushes, and other grass-like plants. This variety is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
