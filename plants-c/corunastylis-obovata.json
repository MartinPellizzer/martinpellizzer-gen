It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its broad, ovate-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
