    "intro": "Crataegus azarolus var. ruscinonensis, commonly known as the Ruscinonese hawthorn, is a rare and ancient variety of hawthorn native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thorny branches and elliptical leaves that have a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and historical significance, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of interest for conservation efforts."
