    "intro": "Carex teretiuscula var. nana, commonly known as dwarf basket sedge, is a low-growing, clump-forming plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a deep green color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the summer. The plant has a compact growth habit, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover in woodland settings. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, and it is often used in native plant landscaping due to its ecological benefits. Its ability to thrive in wet conditions also makes it suitable for water garden edges or boggy areas."
