    "intro": "Chupalon benthamianum, commonly known as the Bentham's chupalon, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are ovate with a hairy texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
