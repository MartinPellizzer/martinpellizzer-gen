    "intro": "Critonia imbricata, commonly known as the mountain rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of South America. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Critonia imbricata is often found growing on rocky slopes and in mountainous regions where it thrives in well-drained soils."
