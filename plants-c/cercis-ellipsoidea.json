    "intro": "Cercis ellipsoidea, commonly known as the elliptic redbud, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a compact, rounded form with smooth, grayish bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are borne on the previous year's wood, and it produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds. Cercis ellipsoidea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
