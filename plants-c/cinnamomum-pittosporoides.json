    "intro": "Cinnamomum pittosporoides, commonly known as the Australian cinnamon or white cinnamom, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rainforest areas. Due to its ornamental value and aromatic properties, it is cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine."
