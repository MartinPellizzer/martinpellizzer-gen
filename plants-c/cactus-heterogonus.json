    "intro": "Cactus heterogonus, commonly known as the variable cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny stems and ability to store water in its thick, fleshy tissues. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to hot, dry climates. Its flowers, which can be yellow or white, bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Due to its resilience and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
