    "intro": "Cousinia ulotoma, commonly known as the woolly cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, adding a splash of color to its rocky or sandy habitat. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is often found in steppes and mountainous areas. Cousinia ulotoma is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils and can withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
