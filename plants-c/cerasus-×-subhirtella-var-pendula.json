    "intro": "Cerasus \u00d7 subhirtella var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping cherry or weeping peach, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its cascading branches that create a distinctive weeping appearance, with small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring. The plant produces small, edible fruits similar to peaches, which ripen in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its seasonal beauty, from blooming flowers to vibrant autumn foliage, makes it a valued addition to horticultural landscapes."
