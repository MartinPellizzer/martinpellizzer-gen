    "intro": "Chorizotheca, commonly known as the \"painted cup,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, colorful bracts that resemble small cups, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. These bracts are not only ornamental but also serve to protect the small, inconspicuous flowers. Chorizotheca species are typically herbaceous and grow in rocky or dry soils, thriving in sunny conditions."
