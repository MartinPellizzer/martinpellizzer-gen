    "intro": "Cyanicula ashbyae, commonly known as the Ashby's cyanicula, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyanicula ashbyae is considered endangered and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Its unique botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
