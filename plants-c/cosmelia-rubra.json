    "intro": "Cosmelia rubra, commonly known as the red flame flower, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, elliptical fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Cosmelia rubra is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant floral display."
