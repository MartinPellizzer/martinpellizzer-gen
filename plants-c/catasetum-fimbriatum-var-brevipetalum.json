    "intro": "Catasetum fimbriatum var. brevipetalum, commonly known as the short-petalled orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often brightly colored flowers. The plant produces a unique type of pollination mechanism involving specialized structures called gynostemium, which aid in the transfer of pollen. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is valued in horticulture for its beauty and relatively manageable care requirements."
