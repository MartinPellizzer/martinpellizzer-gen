    "intro": "Centrolobium microchaete, commonly known as the Brazilian ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, elongated pods containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in traditional medicine. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in its natural range."
