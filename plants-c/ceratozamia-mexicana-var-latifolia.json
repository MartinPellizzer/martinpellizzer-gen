    "intro": "Ceratozamia mexicana var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The leaves are typically broad and have a distinctive dark green color with a waxy texture. This plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and it produces cones rather than flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
