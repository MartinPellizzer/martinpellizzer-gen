    "intro": "Callicarpa viridis, commonly known as green beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its small, bright green berries that contrast with its dark green foliage. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by its distinctive berries in the fall. Callicarpa viridis thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in ornamental landscaping for its visual appeal. Its berries are not typically edible for humans but are a food source for birds and other wildlife."
