It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from green to red and yellow. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by distinctive, spiky fruit capsules. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
