    "intro": "Cleome pubescens, commonly known as the horsebean plant, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces distinctive, inflated seed pods that contain several bean-like seeds. Cleome pubescens is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings. It has feathery, hairy leaves that contribute to its ornamental appeal in some garden contexts."
