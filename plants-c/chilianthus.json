    "intro": "Chilianthus, commonly known as the golden rain tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow inflorescences that resemble cascading raindrops, which appear in late spring to early summer. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Chilianthus is also valued for its ability to tolerate urban conditions, including pollution and compacted soils."
