    "intro": "Calorophus, commonly known as the fireweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, pink to purple flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant is native to North America and thrives in disturbed soils, often found along roadsides and in open fields. Calorophus produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which allow it to spread efficiently across various habitats. Its common name reflects its ability to thrive in areas affected by fire or human activity."
