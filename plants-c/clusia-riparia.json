    "intro": "Clusia riparia, commonly known as the river clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by oval, fleshy fruits. Clusia riparia is well adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found near riverbanks and in humid lowland forests. Its resilience to environmental stress makes it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping in tropical regions."
