    "intro": "Cirsium scopulorum, commonly known as the rock thistle, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its spiny, gray-green leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as meadows and dry slopes. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, and the plant produces a tall, erect stem with a single flower head at the top. Cirsium scopulorum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth and persistent seed production."
