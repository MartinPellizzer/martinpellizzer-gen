    "intro": "Crataegus oxyacantha f. splendens, commonly known as the white thorned hawthorn, is a cultivar of the common hawthorn. It is characterized by its pale white flowers that contrast with its dark green foliage, making it a striking ornamental plant. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are edible but often used for ornamental purposes rather than consumption. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes. This cultivar is valued for its aesthetic appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
