    "intro": "Citrullus lanatus var. minor, commonly known as the wild watermelon, is a botanical variant of the watermelon species. It is characterized by its smaller size and typically less sweet flesh compared to cultivated watermelons. This variety is native to Africa and thrives in arid and semi-arid climates. The plant produces pale yellow flowers and develops a round, green fruit with a thick rind. It is valued for its hardiness and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to grow in poor soil conditions."
