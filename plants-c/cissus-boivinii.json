    "intro": "Cissus boivinii, commonly known as the African nettle or rock fig, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive net-veined patterns. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its stems are often armed with small, stiff spines, which help in climbing and deterring herbivores. Cissus boivinii is adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a resilient and hardy species."
