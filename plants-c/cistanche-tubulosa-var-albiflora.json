    "intro": "Cistanche tubulosa var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered tubular cistanche, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients, typically growing on species of the genus Artemisia. The plant produces yellow or white flowers that bloom in late summer, and its stems are often branched and covered in fine hairs. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of China and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Due to its parasitic nature and habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
