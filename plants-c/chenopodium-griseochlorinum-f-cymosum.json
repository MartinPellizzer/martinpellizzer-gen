It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in cymes, which are clusters of flowers with a single terminal flower. The species is native to arid and semi-arid regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a notable species in ecological and botanical studies."
