This hybrid citrus plant is a cross between the mandarin orange and the kumquat, resulting in a unique fruit that is both a citrus and a small orange. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped fruit with a thin, edible peel. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, with glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant white flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and the sweet, tangy fruit it produces, which is often used in cooking and as a decorative element."
