    "intro": "Chorizema spectabile, commonly known as the showy mountain lily, is a perennial herb native to the high elevations of the western United States. It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescence composed of multiple white to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to its alpine habitat. Chorizema spectabile is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
