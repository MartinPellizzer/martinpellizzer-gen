    "intro": "Cleghornia gracilis, commonly known as the slender cleghornia, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Cleghornia gracilis is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
