    "intro": "Calyptranthes tonduzii, commonly known as the Tonduz\u2019s calyptranthes, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes well-known plants like eucalyptus and myrtle. The plant is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and dark green. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, berry-like fruits. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species in its native habitat."
