    "intro": "Cytisus supinus f. sofianus, commonly known as the dwarf yellow broom, is a compact shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding vibrant color to rocky or sunny habitats. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are densely packed, giving it a compact appearance. It is well adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or limestone areas. This form is a natural variant of Cytisus supinus, distinguished by its smaller size and more intense floral display."
