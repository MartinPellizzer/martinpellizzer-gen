    "intro": "Carex cumberlandensis, commonly known as Cumberland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as bogs, marshes, and along stream banks. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like clusters of small, greenish flowers. Carex cumberlandensis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
