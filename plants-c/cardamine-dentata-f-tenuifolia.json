    "intro": "Cardamine dentata f. tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender water crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, often calcareous habitats. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves with finely serrated margins and small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a dense, upright cluster. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in stream sides and marshy areas. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and it is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed wetlands. The species is characterized by its slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves, making it distinct from other members of the Ranunculaceae family."
