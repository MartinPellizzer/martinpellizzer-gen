    "intro": "Cogswellia plummerae, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent leaves and its unique, showy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient absorption. Its delicate structure and limited habitat make it highly vulnerable to environmental changes. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is often protected and studied in conservation programs."
