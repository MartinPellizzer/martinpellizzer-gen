    "intro": "Cantinoa violacea, commonly known as the violet bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of violet-blue, bell-shaped flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture, and they are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and the long-lasting blooms that attract pollinators."
