    "intro": "Coccothrinax clarensis subsp. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved palm, is a compact, shrub-like palm native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It features a slender, unbranched stem with a smooth, grayish-brown trunk and small, clustered leaves that are short and stiff. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by round, orange fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to salt spray and sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
