    "intro": "Cnicus undulatus, commonly known as the sandspur, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing annual herb with yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has hairy, branched stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. Its seeds are enclosed in a spiny capsule, which aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas."
