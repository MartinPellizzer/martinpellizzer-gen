It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or wet meadows. Carex unilateralis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
