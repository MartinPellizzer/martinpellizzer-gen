    "intro": "Carpodinus jespersenii, commonly known as the Jespersen's carpet grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth system allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize disturbed soils. It is often found in wetland habitats and is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
