    "intro": "Centipeda minima, commonly known as the small centipede plant, is a low-growing herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that bear small, narrow leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces tiny, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or containers. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often used in xeriscaping and drought-tolerant landscapes."
