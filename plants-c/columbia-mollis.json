    "intro": "Columbia mollis, commonly known as the Pacific silver fir, is a tall evergreen conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-blue needles and a conical shape that becomes more irregular with age. The tree produces cones that hang downward, containing winged seeds dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing some protection against fires. Columbia mollis plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, offering habitat and food for various wildlife species."
