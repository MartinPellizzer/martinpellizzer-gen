    "intro": "Cyclanthera tenuisepala var. integerrima, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bitter gourd, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, pale green stems and small, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits with a bitter taste. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a distinctive shape with a narrow base. This species is often cultivated for its edible fruit, though it requires careful handling due to its bitterness."
