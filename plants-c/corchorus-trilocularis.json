    "intro": "Corchorus trilocularis, commonly known as the African blueberry or slender dock, is a flowering plant native to Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which are surrounded by a specialized structure called a cyathium. Its roots are rich in mucilage and have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their soothing properties. The plant thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks."
