    "intro": "Campsis fortunei, commonly known as the Chinese trumpetflower, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its showy, tubular, orange-red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and a rough texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
