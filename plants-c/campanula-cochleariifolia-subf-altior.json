    "intro": "Campanula cochleariifolia subf. altior, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The leaves are typically basal, arranged in a rosette, and are hairy, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh alpine environment. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes. This sub-species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
