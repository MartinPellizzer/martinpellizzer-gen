    "intro": "Carex pertenuis, commonly known as slender sedges, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. It is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Carex pertenuis is also used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
