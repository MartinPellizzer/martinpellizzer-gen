    "intro": "Circaeocarpus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking, spiky flower heads that resemble small sea urchins, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and saline soils, showing a high tolerance for salt and wind. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Circaeocarpus species are often used in ornamental gardening due to their unique appearance and hardy nature."
