    "intro": "Carduus horridulus, commonly known as the common cocklebur, is a member of the Asteraceae family. It is a biennial or annual herb that typically grows in disturbed soils and open areas. The plant features rough, spiny leaves and produces distinctive burrs with hooked spines, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. The plant is often found in fields, roadsides, and other disturbed habitats across Europe and parts of Asia."
