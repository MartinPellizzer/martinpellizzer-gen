It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are typically shaped like a shield or heart. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbels, which are followed by dark blue to black berries. It thrives in a variety of soil types and prefers moist, well-drained conditions. English ivy is often used in landscaping for its ability to cover walls and ground surfaces effectively."
