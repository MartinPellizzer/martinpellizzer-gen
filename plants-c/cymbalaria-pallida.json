    "intro": "Cymbalaria pallida, commonly known as the pale-flowered stormy runner, is a flowering plant in the family Plantaginaceae. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and distinctive blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has oval, hairy leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
