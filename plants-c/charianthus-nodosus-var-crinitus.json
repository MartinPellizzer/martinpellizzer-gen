It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to violet in color, with a distinctive nodding habit. The plant has hairy foliage, which gives it its specific epithet \"crinitus,\" meaning \"hairy\" in Latin. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
