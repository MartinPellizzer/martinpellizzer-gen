    "intro": "Caiophora, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic flowering plants native to Asia. These plants are characterized by their large, showy flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in shades of pink, white, or yellow. The leaves are broad and floating, with a waxy surface that repels water, a feature known as the \"lotus effect.\" Caiophora species are often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. They play an important ecological role in water ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
