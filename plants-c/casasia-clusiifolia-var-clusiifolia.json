    "intro": "[WRONG START] Casia clusiifolia var. clusiifolia, commonly known as the flame tree, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy, fiery orange to red flowers that bloom in clusters, making it a popular ornamental species. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. The bark is thick and often peels to reveal a bright red or orange inner layer, adding to its visual appeal."
