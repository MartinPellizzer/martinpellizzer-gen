    "intro": "Celsia betonicifolia f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-leaved celsia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family, characterized by its bell-shaped flowers and herbaceous growth habit. The plant features smooth, glabrous leaves that are typically lanceolate in shape, with a soft green hue. Its flowers are blue or violet in color, often clustered in racemose inflorescences, and bloom during the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
