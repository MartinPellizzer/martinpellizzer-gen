    "intro": "Collabium acuticalcar, commonly known as the sharp-winged orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves and striking, violet-pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its unique floral structure includes specialized nectar-producing structures that attract specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Collabium acuticalcar is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
