    "intro": "Colpodium tilesii, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its flowers are small and usually white or pale yellow, with a distinctive bilaterally symmetrical shape. Colpodium tilesii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
