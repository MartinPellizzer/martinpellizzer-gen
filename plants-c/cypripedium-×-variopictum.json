    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 variopictum, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium pubescens. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. The plant features a distinctive, showy flower with a pouch-like lip and intricate patterns on its petals. Its leaves are typically broad and grass-like, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens but remains rare in the wild."
