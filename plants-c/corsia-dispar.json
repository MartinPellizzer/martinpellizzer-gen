    "intro": "Corsia dispar, commonly known as the variable coralroot, is an herbaceous plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph that relies on fungal associations for nutrition. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It is native to eastern North America and thrives in moist, shaded forest environments. Due to its reliance on specific fungi, Corsia dispar plays a unique role in forest ecosystems."
