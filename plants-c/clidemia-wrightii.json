    "intro": "Clidemia wrightii, commonly known as Wright's mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its showy, pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces. It produces small, elliptical berries that are dispersed by birds, contributing to its spread in the wild. Clidemia wrightii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
