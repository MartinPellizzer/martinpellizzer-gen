    "intro": "Calanthe mishmensis, commonly known as the Mishmensis Calanthe, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a delicate beauty to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
