    "intro": "Colymbada clementei, commonly known as the Clement's colymbada, is a rare and endangered species of flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically endangered, with only a few populations remaining in the wild. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique species."
