    "intro": "Carduus defloratus var. cirsioides, commonly known as the common cocklebur, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and large, yellow flower heads that resemble a bur. The plant produces numerous seeds enclosed in a prickly, spherical husk, which aids in its dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
