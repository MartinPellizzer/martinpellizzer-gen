    "intro": "Cyperus imbricatus var. multiflorus, commonly known as the broadleaf flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland areas in tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a fan-like pattern at the base. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers, which are often hidden among the foliage. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in wetland ecosystems and a common indicator of waterlogged conditions."
