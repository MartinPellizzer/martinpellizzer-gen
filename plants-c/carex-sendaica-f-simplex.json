    "intro": "Carex sendaica f. simplex, commonly known as the simple sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in temperate regions. Its simple, unbranched leaves distinguish it from other sedge species. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in its native environment."
