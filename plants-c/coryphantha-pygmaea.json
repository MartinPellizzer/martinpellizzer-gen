    "intro": "Coryphantha pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf hedgehog cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a compact, globular shape with a ribbed structure that helps it store water efficiently. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its shallow root system allows it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils with minimal water. Due to its delicate nature, it requires careful handling and is often grown in containers to protect it from harsh environmental conditions."
