It is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a slightly hairy texture. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds."
