It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale to brownish flowers, typical of many Cyperus species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along water bodies. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
