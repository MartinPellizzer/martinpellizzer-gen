    "intro": "Copiapoa atacamensis var. calderana, commonly known as the Calder\u00f3n cactus, is a columnar cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It features a ribbed stem with a gray-green color and spines that are typically white or pale yellow. This variety is characterized by its relatively small size, often reaching only a few meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stem and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture from the soil."
