    "intro": "Chrysopogon montanus var. serrulatus, commonly known as the serrated mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blade-like leaves with serrated edges. The plant typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in cool and temperate climates. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often wind-pollinated. This variety is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its adaptation to extreme environmental conditions."
