    "intro": "Cupressus lambertiana, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada redwood, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves and its ability to form tall, straight trunks. The plant has a distinctive reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. It thrives in moist, cool climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Its cones are small and typically contain two to three seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
