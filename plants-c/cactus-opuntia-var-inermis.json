    "intro": "Cactus opuntia var. inermis, commonly known as the paddle cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are ribbed and covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its thick, succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance."
