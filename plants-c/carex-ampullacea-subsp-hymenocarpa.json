    "intro": "Carex ampullacea subsp. hymenocarpa, commonly known as the smooth sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat for various wildlife. The subspecies is distinguished by its smooth, glabrous leaves and distinctive fruiting structures."
