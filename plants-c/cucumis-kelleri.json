It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other cucurbits like cucumbers and melons. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically green and covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, and it thrives in hot, dry climates with minimal water requirements. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated in regions with limited agricultural resources."
