    "intro": "Comparettia tungurahuae, commonly known as the Tungurahua orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Ecuador. It belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant thrives in high-altitude cloud forests, where it relies on specific microhabitats for survival. Its botanical features include a sympodial growth habit and pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
