    "intro": "Callicarpa tomentosa var. lanata, commonly known as the woolly beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green foliage and clusters of small, violet-blue berries that appear in the fall. The plant thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained soil. Its ornamental value comes from its unique foliage and showy fruit, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. The berries are edible but often consumed by birds rather than humans."
