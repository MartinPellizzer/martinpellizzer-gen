    "intro": "Cycas pachypoda, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a species of cycad native to Australia. It is characterized by its large, fern-like leaves and a stout, unbranched trunk. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It is a slow-growing, long-lived plant that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
