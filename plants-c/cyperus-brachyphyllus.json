It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered spikelets. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it often grows in wet or moist soils, such as marshes and along waterways. The plant produces tiny flowers that are typically wind-pollinated, and it is sometimes used in ornamental horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal. Its botanical features make it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
