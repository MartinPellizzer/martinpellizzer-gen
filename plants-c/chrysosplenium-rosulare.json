    "intro": "Chrysosplenium rosulare, commonly known as the rosette spleenwort, is a member of the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. It features small, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually arranged in a tight, clustered formation. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the base of the rosette. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along streams. Chrysosplenium rosulare is a low-growing perennial that is well adapted to cool, humid climates."
