    "intro": "Chamaecrista ochnacea var. mollis, commonly known as silky burr legume, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which are trifoliate with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, racemose inflorescences, followed by woody, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as savannas and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
