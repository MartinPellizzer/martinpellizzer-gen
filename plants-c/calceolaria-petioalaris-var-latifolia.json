    "intro": "Calceolaria petioalaris var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved slipper orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive calyx-like labellum, which resembles a slipper or pouch, and its lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of yellow and orange. Its foliage is broad and often has a velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variant is prized in horticulture for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in cool, humid conditions."
