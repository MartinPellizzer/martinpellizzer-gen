    "intro": "Cissus paucinervia, commonly known as the African leafcreeper, is a climbing vine native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, waxy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round fruits that turn red when mature. Its stems are flexible and can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread easily. Cissus paucinervia thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
