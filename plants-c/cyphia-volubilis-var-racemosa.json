It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences, which give it its scientific name. Its stems are flexible and can twine around supports, making it suitable for trellises or pergolas. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
