    "intro": "Comptonella lactea, commonly known as the milkweed plant, is a member of the Apocynaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in terminal inflorescences. Its milky sap, which gives it its common name, contains toxic compounds that deter herbivores. Comptonella lactea is native to parts of Africa and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments."
