    "intro": "Cardamine calcicola, commonly known as the limestone watercress, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to calcareous soils in Europe. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many familiar edible and medicinal plants. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky streambanks. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a delicate, fern-like appearance, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. The species is noted for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, alkaline conditions, making it an indicator plant for limestone-rich habitats."
