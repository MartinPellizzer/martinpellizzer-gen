    "intro": "Cereus imbricatus, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored tubular flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a swollen, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its roots are shallow and fibrous, adapted to absorb moisture from the soil efficiently. The plant is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit."
