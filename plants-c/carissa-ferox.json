    "intro": "Carissa ferox, commonly known as the yellow bell tree, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, featuring thick, woody stems and dense foliage. The plant produces fragrant, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to reveal bright red, fleshy berries, which are edible but have a bitter taste. Carissa ferox is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions."
