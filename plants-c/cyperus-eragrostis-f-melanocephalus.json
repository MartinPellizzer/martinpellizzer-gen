    "intro": "Cyperus eragrostis f. melanocephalus, commonly known as black-headed flatsedge, is a variant of the flatsedge genus native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and distinctive, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils, often found in marshy areas or along waterways. Its dark purple to black bracts give it its notable appearance, making it easily distinguishable from other Cyperus species. This form is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological adaptability and role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments."
