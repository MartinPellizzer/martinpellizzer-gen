It is characterized by its striking red or pink petals and is often found in high-altitude grasslands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. It is adapted to cold, dry environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
