    "intro": "Calorhabdos latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf calorhabd, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
