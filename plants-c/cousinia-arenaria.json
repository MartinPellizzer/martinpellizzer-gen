    "intro": "Cousinia arenaria, commonly known as sand couch grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Europe. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in steppes and deserts. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots help prevent soil erosion, making it an important species in stabilizing dunes and degraded lands. Cousinia arenaria is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, showcasing resilience to drought and extreme temperatures."
