    "intro": "Cypselea humifusa, commonly known as the creeping cypress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features a mat-forming habit with small, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers in the spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded woodland areas. Its ornamental value comes from its compact form and attractive foliage, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
