    "intro": "Cota tinctoria subsp. euxina, commonly known as the red madder, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant produces red, staining pigments known as rubias, which have been historically used in dyeing textiles. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry grasslands and rocky habitats. Its botanical significance lies in its traditional use in natural dyeing and its role in ecological systems."
