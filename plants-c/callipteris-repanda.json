    "intro": "Callipteris repanda, commonly known as the coastal maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, fan-shaped fronds that are often adorned with a fine, silky texture. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is typically found in coastal areas and wetlands. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it establish in sandy or disturbed soils. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
