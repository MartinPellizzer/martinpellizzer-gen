    "intro": "Chenopodium album f. pseudopulifolium, commonly known as prickly goosefoot, is a variant of the common lambsquarters. It is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often found in disturbed soils and agricultural fields. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves with serrated margins and a rough texture. Its inflorescence consists of small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and it produces dry, triangular seeds. This form is distinguished by its more pronounced pubescence and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form of Chenopodium album."
