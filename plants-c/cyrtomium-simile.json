It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically bright green with a golden hue on the underside. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are clustered and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. Cyrtomium simile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
