    "intro": "Cyperus esculentus var. nervosostriatus, commonly known as the nut sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, with a distinctive swollen base that resembles a nut. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or reddish in color, and it thrives in moist, disturbed soils. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems."
