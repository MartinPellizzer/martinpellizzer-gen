    "intro": "Cedrus deodara var. aurea, commonly known as the golden cedar, is a variety of the deodar cedar native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts strikingly with its dark green needles. The tree has a conical shape with a broad, pyramidal crown and can grow quite tall, reaching up to 40 meters in height. Its bark is reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age, adding to its ornamental appeal. This variety is prized for its aesthetic value and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its visual impact."
