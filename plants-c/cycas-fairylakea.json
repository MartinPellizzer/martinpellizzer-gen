    "intro": "Cycas fairylakea, commonly known as the Fairy Lake cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the coastal regions of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones, with male cones clustered at the base of the trunk and female cones emerging from the upper parts of the plant. Cycas fairylakea is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes, where it thrives in well-drained conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
