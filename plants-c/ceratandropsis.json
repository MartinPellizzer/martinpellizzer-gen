    "intro": "Ceratandropsis, commonly known as the horned bean, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Leguminosae. These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa and are characterized by their distinctive, horn-like seed pods. The leaves are typically compound, with a pinnate structure, and the flowers are small and clustered in racemes. Ceratandropsis species are often shrubs or small trees, and they produce seeds that are encased in hard, woody pods. The genus is noted for its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife and its potential use in traditional medicine."
