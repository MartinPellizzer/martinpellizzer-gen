    "intro": "Cephalophyllum rostellum, commonly known as the horned cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like spines and fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its striking appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and desert landscapes."
