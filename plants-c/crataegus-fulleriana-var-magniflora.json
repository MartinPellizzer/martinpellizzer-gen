    "intro": "Crataegus fulleriana var. magniflora, commonly known as the showy hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny branches, ovate to elliptical leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its showy flowers and persistent fruit, making it a popular choice for landscaping."
