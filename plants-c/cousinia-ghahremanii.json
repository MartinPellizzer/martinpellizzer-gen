    "intro": "Cousinia ghahremanii, commonly known as the Persian cushion plant, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Iran. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Cousinia ghahremanii is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient species in dry climates."
