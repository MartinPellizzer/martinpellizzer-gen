It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, blue to violet flowers. The plant produces numerous small seeds that are dispersed by the wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. It is often found in fields, roadsides, and other open habitats. Conyza arabidifolia is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
