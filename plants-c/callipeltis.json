    "intro": "Callipeltis, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. These plants are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas. They are characterized by their distinctive silver or gray foliage, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Callipeltis species typically produce small, bell-shaped flowers that are often purple or blue in color. The fruits are usually berries that contain toxic compounds, making them unsuitable for human consumption."
