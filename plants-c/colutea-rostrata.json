It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves and showy pink or red flowers. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Colutea rostrata is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Its growth habit and floral structure make it a notable species in ecological and botanical studies."
