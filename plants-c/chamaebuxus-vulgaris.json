    "intro": "Chamaebuxus vulgaris, commonly known as the common holly, is a dense, evergreen shrub native to western and central Europe. It features sharp, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with red or yellow berries that persist through winter. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight. Its slow growth rate and dense foliage make it an effective hedging plant. Chamaebuxus vulgaris is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in festive decorations."
