    "intro": "Cestrum obovatum, commonly known as the night-blooming coffee plant, is a flowering shrub native to Central and South America. It features opposite, elliptical to obovate leaves that are often glaucous in appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that open at night, attracting moths and other nocturnal pollinators. Its showy, white or pale yellow blossoms are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Cestrum obovatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
