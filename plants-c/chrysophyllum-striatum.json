    "intro": "Chrysophyllum striatum, commonly known as the African cherry or striated starfruit, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by yellow-orange fruits resembling starfruits, though they are not related to the common starfruit. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and showy blooms, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. The tree is also valued for its hard, durable wood and has traditional uses in various parts of its native range."
