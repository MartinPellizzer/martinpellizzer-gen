    "intro": "Cerastium tomentosum var. tomentosum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has fuzzy, hairy leaves that are rounded and often covered in fine white trichomes, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and garden beds. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover."
