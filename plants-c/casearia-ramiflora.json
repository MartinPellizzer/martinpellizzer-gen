    "intro": "Casearia ramiflora, commonly known as the Brazilian beautyberry, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Casearia ramiflora thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural settings."
