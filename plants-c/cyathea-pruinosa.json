    "intro": "Cyathea pruinosa, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, compound fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its fronds are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which contributes to its common name. Cyathea pruinosa plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various small organisms."
