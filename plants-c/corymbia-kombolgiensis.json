    "intro": "Corymbia kombolgiensis, commonly known as the Kombolgie ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh climates."
