It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches and showy, pink to white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries that are edible for birds and small mammals but generally not for humans. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Crataegus infesta is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
