    "intro": "Corylus californica, commonly known as the California hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the birch family (Betulaceae) and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, nut-like fruits. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination. Its bark is smooth and gray, and it often grows in moist, well-drained soils. The nuts are edible and have been used by both indigenous peoples and wildlife for food."
