    "intro": "Clausena suffruticosa, commonly known as the African yellow-wood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters and has a dense, compact form with dark green, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. The bark and leaves have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their purported health benefits."
