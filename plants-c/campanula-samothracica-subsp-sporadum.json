    "intro": "Campanula samothracica subsp. sporadum, commonly known as the Sporadic Bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Greek island of Samothrace. It is characterized by its bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in open, sunny habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and branching. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
