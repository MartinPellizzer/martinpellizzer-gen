    "intro": "Cavendishia cordata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf cactus, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically modified into spines, reducing water loss through transpiration. Cavendishia cordata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
