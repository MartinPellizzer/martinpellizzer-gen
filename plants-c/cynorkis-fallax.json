    "intro": "Cynorkis fallax, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a powdery white coating, known as a bloom. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Cynorkis fallax is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative ground cover due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature."
