It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 12,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. The tree is often found in lowland and montane forests, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
