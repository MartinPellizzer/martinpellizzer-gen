    "intro": "Coelogyne binuangensis, commonly known as the Binuang orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often displaying shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and help store water, adapting it to its humid, shaded environment. The orchid is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
