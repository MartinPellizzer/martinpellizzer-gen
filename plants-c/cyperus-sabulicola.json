    "intro": "Cyperus sabulicola, commonly known as the sand flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to sandy coastal areas. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown flowers. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and wind, making it a hardy species in coastal ecosystems. Cyperus sabulicola plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms."
