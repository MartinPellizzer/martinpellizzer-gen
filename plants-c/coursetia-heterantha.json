    "intro": "Coursetia heterantha, commonly known as the desert broom. It is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowering period typically occurs in the spring, and it is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Coursetia heterantha plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
