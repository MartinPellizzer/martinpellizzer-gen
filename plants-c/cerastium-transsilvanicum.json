    "intro": "Cerastium transsilvanicum, commonly known as the Transylvanian chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Cerastium transsilvanicum is often found in rocky or sandy soils, growing in open areas such as meadows and woodland edges."
