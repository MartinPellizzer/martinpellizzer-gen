    "intro": "Cyperus parlatoris var. difformis, commonly known as the variable flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist or wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Due to its adaptability, it is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
