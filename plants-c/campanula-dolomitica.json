    "intro": "Campanula dolomitica, commonly known as the Dolomitic Bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, limestone-rich soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture. Campanula dolomitica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
