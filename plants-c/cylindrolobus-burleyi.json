It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in sandy soils and requires well-drained conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
