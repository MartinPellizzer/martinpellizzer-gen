    "intro": "Castilleja rubicundula subsp. lithospermoides, commonly known as the red-stemmed Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on the roots of other plants for some of its nutrients. It is native to the western United States, particularly in areas with rocky soils and open habitats. The plant produces showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, linear, and often covered in fine hairs. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar to pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
