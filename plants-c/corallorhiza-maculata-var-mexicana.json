    "intro": "Corallorhiza maculata var. mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican pink beard tongue, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on other plants for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers with a distinctive beard-like structure at the base of the petals. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its botanical characteristics reflect adaptations to its parasitic lifestyle and specific ecological niche."
