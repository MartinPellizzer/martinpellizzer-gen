It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and bright blue or violet flowers. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often in full sun. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution across temperate regions."
