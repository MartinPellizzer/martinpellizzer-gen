    "intro": "Cynanchum glabrum var. rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaf milkweed, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and heart-shaped, broad leaves that are typically rounded at the base. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by cylindrical seed pods. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The species is noted for its latex-containing sap, which can be toxic to some animals."
