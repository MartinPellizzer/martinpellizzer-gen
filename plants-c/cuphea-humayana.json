It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a contrasting throat. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that contribute to its distinctive appearance and help in moisture retention. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by hummingbirds, making it an important species for avian pollinators. Cuphea humayana is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
