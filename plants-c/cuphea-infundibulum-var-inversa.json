    "intro": "Cuphea infundibulum var. inversa, commonly known as the reverse candle bush, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red bracts that resemble candles, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers inside the bracts, adding a contrasting color to its overall appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its unique appearance and ornamental value make it a desirable plant for both gardeners and botanists."
