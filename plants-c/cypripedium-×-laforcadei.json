    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 laforcadei, commonly known as the Laforcade's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its showy, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white with a deep purple or brown lip. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often arranged in a fan shape, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
