    "intro": "Chromolaena linearis, commonly known as the stinging nettle or false nettle, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, stinging hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Chromolaena linearis is known for its aggressive growth and is considered an invasive species in many areas outside its native range. Its rapid spread can lead to ecological disruption and challenges in land management."
