    "intro": "Ceanothus prostratus var. occidentalis, commonly known as the western prostrate ceanothus, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has fine, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its floral display. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
