It is a succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, spiny leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
