    "intro": "Carex glauca var. flavescens, commonly known as the blue-green sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that ranges from blue-green to grayish in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other riparian habitats. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
