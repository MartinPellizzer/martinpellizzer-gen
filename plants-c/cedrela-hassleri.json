    "intro": "Cedrela hassleri, commonly known as the Honduras mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elongated leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, oval-shaped fruits containing several seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its fine grain and durability, making it a sought-after timber species. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as endangered in many regions."
