    "intro": "Cherleria circassica, commonly known as the Caucasian cherleria, is a rare flowering plant native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cherleria circassica is considered a vulnerable species."
