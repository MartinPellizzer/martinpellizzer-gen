    "intro": "Callicarpa tomentosa var. magna, commonly known as the large-fruit beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white flowers that give way to striking, violet-purple berries. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and thrives in partial to full sun. Its hairy, grayish foliage and showy fruit make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The berries are edible but often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal."
