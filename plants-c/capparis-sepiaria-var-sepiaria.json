    "intro": "Capparis sepiaria var. sepiaria, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, woody stems and distinctive blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often growing in rocky or coastal habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy, drought-resistant nature."
