    "intro": "Campylochnella katangensis, commonly known as the Katanga fern, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds. The plant exhibits a unique growth pattern, with its rhizomes forming dense, low-lying mats. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typical of many epiphytic ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Campylochnella katangensis is considered a vulnerable species."
