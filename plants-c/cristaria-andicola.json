    "intro": "Cristaria andicola, commonly known as the Andean starwort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and sometimes edible species. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
