    "intro": "Carex knorringiae, commonly known as Knorring's sedge, is a perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Carex genus, which is part of the Cyperaceae family, known for its grass-like appearance and ability to thrive in moist environments. The plant typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and rocky slopes, preferring cool and temperate climates. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of flowers that bloom in the summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitats."
