    "intro": "Coelogyne corniculata, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers that resemble horns, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually dark green and strap-like, and it produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Coelogyne corniculata is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its unique and showy blooms."
