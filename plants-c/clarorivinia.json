    "intro": "Clarorivinia, commonly known as the moonflower vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, fragrant, white flowers that bloom at night, emitting a sweet scent to attract pollinators. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, while the stems are woody and capable of rapid growth. Clarorivinia thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its botanical significance lies in its unique nocturnal blooming habit and ornamental value in gardens."
