    "intro": "Chrysopogon parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered grass, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, pale blue to white flowers arranged in dense spikes. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Chrysopogon parviflorus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
