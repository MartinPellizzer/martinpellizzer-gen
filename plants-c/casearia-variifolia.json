    "intro": "Casearia variifolia, commonly known as the variable casearia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Casearia variifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
