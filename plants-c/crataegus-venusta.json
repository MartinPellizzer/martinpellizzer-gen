    "intro": "Crataegus venusta, commonly known as the beautiful hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches and showy white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits called pomes, which are edible but often considered tart. Crataegus venusta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it thrives in a variety of soil types once established."
