It is characterized by its narrow, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white to grayish hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant blue or purple flowers in the spring, which attract a variety of pollinators. It typically grows in well-drained soils in woodland or chaparral habitats. Ceanothus ovalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
