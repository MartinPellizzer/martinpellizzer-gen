    "intro": "Chamaesyce tonsita, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It typically features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are often inconspicuous and appear in the axils of the leaves. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Chamaesyce tonsita is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a common weed in desert landscapes."
