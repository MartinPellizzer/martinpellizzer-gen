    "intro": "Cardamine bradei, commonly known as the brade's watercress, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically borne on slender stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a raceme, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. Its presence often indicates a healthy, undisturbed ecosystem due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
