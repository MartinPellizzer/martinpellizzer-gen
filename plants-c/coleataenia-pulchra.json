    "intro": "Coleataenia pulchra, commonly known as the pretty fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically green with a subtle sheen. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, moist soil to flourish. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing clusters, are located on the underside of its fronds. Coleataenia pulchra is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
