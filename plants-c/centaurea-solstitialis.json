    "intro": "Centaurea solstitialis, commonly known as yellow starthistle, is an invasive annual weed native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny stems, yellow flowers, and a distinctive star-shaped involucrum. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, contributing to its rapid spread. The plant's ability to produce a large number of seeds and its tolerance to drought make it a challenging weed to control."
