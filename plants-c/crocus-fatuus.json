It is characterized by its striking violet or blue flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant grows in rocky, arid environments and is often found in coastal areas. Its bulbs are toxic, containing compounds that can cause severe illness if ingested. Despite its beauty, it is considered a symbol of death and is associated with the myth of the Sirens."
