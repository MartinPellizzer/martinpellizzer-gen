    "intro": "Campanula pusilla var. subramulosa, commonly known as the small bellflower or dwarf bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features compact, basal rosettes of narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to form dense, attractive ground cover in alpine or rock garden settings."
