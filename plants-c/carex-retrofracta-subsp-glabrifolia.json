It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and spikelets that form dense, cylindrical clusters. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along water edges. Its inflorescence consists of two to three spikelets, with the lower one being female and the upper one male. The subspecies is distinguished by its smooth, glabrous leaf surfaces and is often found in temperate regions of North America."
