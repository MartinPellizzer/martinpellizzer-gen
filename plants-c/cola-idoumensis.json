    "intro": "Cola idoumensis, commonly known as the African cola tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces spherical, woody pods that contain seeds surrounded by a stimulant-rich mucilage. It is often found in humid lowland forests and is valued for its ecological role and traditional uses. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable to extinction in the wild."
