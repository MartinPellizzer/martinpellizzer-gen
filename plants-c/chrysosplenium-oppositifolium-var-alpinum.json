It features small, kidney-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its delicate nature, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
