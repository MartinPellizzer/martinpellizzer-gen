    "intro": "Chionanthus bumelioides subsp. lanceolatus, commonly known as the lanceleaf whiteflower bush, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its ornamental value comes from its showy inflorescences and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often used in native plant gardens for its ecological and aesthetic benefits."
