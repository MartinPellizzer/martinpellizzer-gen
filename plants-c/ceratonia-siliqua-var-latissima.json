    "intro": "Ceratonia siliqua var. latissima, commonly known as the broad-leaved carob tree, is a variant of the carob tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are wider than those of the typical carob tree. The plant produces long, pod-like fruits that contain sweet, edible seeds surrounded by a sticky pulp. It thrives in dry, warm climates and is often used for its nutritional value and ornamental qualities. The tree is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for agricultural ecosystems."
