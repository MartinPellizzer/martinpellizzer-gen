    "intro": "Cerastium riaei subsp. gracile, commonly known as slender mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to coastal regions of western Europe. It typically forms dense mats of small, hairy leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in early summer. The plant is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or rocky shores. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in harsh maritime conditions make it an important component of coastal vegetation. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens with well-drained soil."
