It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to pink. The plant produces clusters of small, hairy bracts that give it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, often with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is well-suited for gardens due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
