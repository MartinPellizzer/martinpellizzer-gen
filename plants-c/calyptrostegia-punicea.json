    "intro": "Calyptrostegia punicea, commonly known as the red-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring. Its berries are red and fleshy, which help in seed dispersal by birds. Calyptrostegia punicea is native to parts of South America and is often found in humid, forested areas."
