It features a basal rosette of dark green, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, golden-yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and rocky areas. Caltha alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, early-season blooms."
