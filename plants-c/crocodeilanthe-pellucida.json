    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe pellucida, commonly known as the glassy fern, is a rare and delicate tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, translucent fronds that give it its common name. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires consistent moisture to flourish. Its unique appearance makes it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and among plant enthusiasts. Due to its limited natural habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
