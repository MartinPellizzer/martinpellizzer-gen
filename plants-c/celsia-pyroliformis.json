    "intro": "Celsia pyroliformis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous structure and clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers in late spring, which are arranged in a loose panicle. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or shaded habitats. Celsia pyroliformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
