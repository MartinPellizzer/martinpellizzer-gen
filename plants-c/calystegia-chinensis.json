    "intro": "Calystegia chinensis, commonly known as Chinese morning glory, is a climbing vine native to East Asia. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, smooth seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
