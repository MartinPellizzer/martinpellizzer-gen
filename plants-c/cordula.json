It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are typically opposite and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly serrated edge. Cordula species are native to parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas, often found in wet or moist habitats. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological roles in supporting pollinators."
