    "intro": "Callitriche anceps subsp. subanceps, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic herbaceous plant found in freshwater environments. It typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has opposite, linear leaves that are often floating or submerged, and it produces small, white or pale flowers with four petals. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the substrate, while its stems are often branched and flexible. This subspecies is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters and its role in supporting aquatic ecosystems."
