    "intro": "Cyperus olfersianus var. elatior, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. The botanical characteristics of this species make it both ecologically significant and adaptable to various aquatic habitats."
