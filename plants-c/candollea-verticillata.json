It is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments. Its fronds are usually pinnately divided, with a delicate, feathery appearance. Candollea verticillata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, indirect light conditions."
