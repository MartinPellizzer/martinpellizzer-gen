It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in wetland habitats such as swamps and marshes. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like flower clusters. It prefers moist to wet soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a common sight in riparian zones. Carex ardoiniana plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
