    "intro": "Coussarea longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered coussarea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically red when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
