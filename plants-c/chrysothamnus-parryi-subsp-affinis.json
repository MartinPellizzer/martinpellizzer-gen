    "intro": "Chrysothamnus parryi subsp. affinis, commonly known as the Parry's goldenbush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellowish-green foliage and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open plains. It has a compact growth habit with dense, branching stems and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The subspecies affinis is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and flowering patterns compared to the main species."
