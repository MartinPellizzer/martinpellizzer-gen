    "intro": "Cnicus maackii, commonly known as Maack's bur marigold, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy, lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or disturbed soils and is often found in marshy areas. It produces small, spiny fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Cnicus maackii is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
