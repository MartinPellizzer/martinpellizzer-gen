    "intro": "Calothamnus lateralis f. longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved bottlebrush, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its striking, crimson-red flower spikes that resemble bottlebrushes. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often longer than those of the typical variety, giving it its distinguishing name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats. This ornamental plant is valued for its unique appearance and ability to attract native pollinators."
