    "intro": "Carex microchaeta subsp. microchaeta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 1 millimeter wide, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike that bears small, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
