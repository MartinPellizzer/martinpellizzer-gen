    "intro": "Clarkella, commonly known as the fairy lantern or desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Portulacaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Clarkella species are characterized by their striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. They typically grow as annual or biennial herbs with succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The genus includes several species, such as Clarkella multiflora and Clarkella grandiflora, which are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in desert ecosystems."
