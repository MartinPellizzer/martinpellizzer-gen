    "intro": "Comolia stenodon, commonly known as the narrow-toothed comolia, is a lesser-known species within the Comolidae family. It is characterized by its slender, elongated body and a distinctive set of narrow, pointed teeth. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense woodland areas. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The flowers, which are small and clustered, are often pale green or yellow, adapting to attract specific pollinators."
