    "intro": "Centaurea \u00d7 toroczkoeensis, commonly known as the Toroczk\u00f6 mountain star, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the Carpathian region of Central Europe. It is characterized by its bright blue to purple composite flower heads, which consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in rocky, open habitats such as grasslands and mountain slopes. Its foliage comprises narrow, upright leaves with serrated edges, and it produces small, bract-like leaves beneath the flower heads. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
