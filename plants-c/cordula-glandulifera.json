    "intro": "Cordula glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular cordula, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces small, glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland habitats. Cordula glandulifera is relatively drought-tolerant and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
