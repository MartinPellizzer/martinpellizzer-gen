    "intro": "Carduus araneosus, commonly known as the spider thistle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a robust, spiny stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, often branching near the top. The plant produces purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, surrounded by a series of bracts that resemble spider legs, giving it its common name. Its leaves are deeply lobed, covered in fine hairs, and have a rough, prickly texture. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its anti-inflammatory and astringent qualities."
