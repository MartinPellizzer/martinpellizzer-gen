    "intro": "Cystopteris obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate water clover, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it spread through vegetative reproduction. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
