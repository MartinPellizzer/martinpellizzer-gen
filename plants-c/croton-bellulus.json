    "intro": "Croton bellulus, commonly known as the dwarf croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often brightly colored with shades of green, yellow, and red. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
