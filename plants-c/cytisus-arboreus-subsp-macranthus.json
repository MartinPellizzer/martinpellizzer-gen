    "intro": "Cytisus arboreus subsp. macranthus, commonly known as the large-flowered broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. It produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature."
