    "intro": "Calytrix pimeleoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved calytrix, is a small evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes other familiar plants like eucalypts and tea trees. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. It typically grows in coastal areas and is well adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden environments. Calytrix pimeleoides is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
