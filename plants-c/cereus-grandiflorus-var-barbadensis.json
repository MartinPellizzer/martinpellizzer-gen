    "intro": "Cereus grandiflorus var. barbadensis, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cactus native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is a spiny, columnar plant that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and is capable of storing water efficiently. It produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The flowers are ephemeral, often closing by dawn, and the plant is well adapted to thrive in harsh, sunny conditions."
