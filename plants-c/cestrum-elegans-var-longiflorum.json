It is characterized by its striking, fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom at night, attracting moths and other nocturnal pollinators. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters, with glossy, dark green leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, orange-red berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
