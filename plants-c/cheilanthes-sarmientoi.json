    "intro": "Cheilanthes sarmientoi, commonly known as the Sarmiento's rockcap, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows on rocky substrates in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth form with short, thick rhizomes and dense clusters of dark green, leathery fronds. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This species is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystems."
