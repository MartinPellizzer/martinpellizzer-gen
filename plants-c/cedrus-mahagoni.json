    "intro": "Cedrus mahagoni, commonly known as the Cuban cedar, is a member of the Pinaceae family and is native to the Caribbean islands. It is a medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and long, slender cones. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to woody, oval-shaped seeds. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against environmental stress. The wood of Cedrus mahagoni is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay, making it a sought-after material in carpentry and construction."
