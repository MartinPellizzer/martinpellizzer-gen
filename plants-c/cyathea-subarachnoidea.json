    "intro": "Cyathea subarachnoidea, commonly known as the silky tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are covered in a dense layer of soft, silky hairs, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for many decades, making it a long-lived component of its ecosystem."
