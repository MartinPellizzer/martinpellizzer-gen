It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that bear large, compound leaves with pinnate arrangements. The plant produces showy, red-purple flowers in racemes, which are particularly noticeable in late summer. Its roots and rhizomes are the primary parts used in traditional and modern herbal medicine. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
