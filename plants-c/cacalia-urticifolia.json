    "intro": "Cacalia urticifolia, commonly known as stinging nettle false violet, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant has a biennial life cycle, with the first year producing only leaves and the second year flowering and setting seed. Its stems and leaves are covered in fine hairs that can cause skin irritation, similar to stinging nettle. The plant is often found in moist, wooded areas and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
