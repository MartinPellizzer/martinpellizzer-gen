    "intro": "Cenchrus echinatus var. viridis, commonly known as green sandgrass, is a variant of the sandgrass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is a perennial grass characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. Its leaves are often a vibrant green, which distinguishes it from the more typical gray-green color of the standard variety. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
