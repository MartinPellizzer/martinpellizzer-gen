    "intro": "Cochemiea thornberi subsp. yaquensis, commonly known as the Yaquense Hedgehog Cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the arid regions of southern Mexico. It typically grows to a height of about 20 centimeters and features a compact, rounded stem covered in dense, woolly white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its gray-green foliage. It is well adapted to dry environments and requires minimal water once established. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
