    "intro": "Carissa acokanthera, commonly known as the poison apple or yellow wood, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, white or yellow flowers. The plant produces small, orange berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its bark and leaves contain alkaloids, which have been used in traditional medicine. However, due to its toxicity, it is often avoided in horticulture and landscaping."
