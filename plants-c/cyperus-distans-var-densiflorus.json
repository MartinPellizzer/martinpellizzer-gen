    "intro": "Cyperus distans var. densiflorus, commonly known as the dense-flowered flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
