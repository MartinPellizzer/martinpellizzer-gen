    "intro": "Coryanthes flava, commonly known as the yellow coryanthe, is a tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and a distinctive, intricately shaped spur that houses its pollinia. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are highly specialized, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and wasps. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
