    "intro": "Cyathea decorata, commonly known as the ornate tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a fibrous, brownish layer of dead fronds. The plant produces large, compound fronds that can reach several meters in length, with a distinctive, elegant appearance. Cyathea decorata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its rhizome system supports the growth of its tall, upright stems and contributes to its ability to colonize various forest habitats."
