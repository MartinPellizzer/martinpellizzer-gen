    "intro": "Claytonia berteroana, commonly known as the Sierra Valley spring beauty, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are oval and often have a waxy coating, helping to retain moisture in its native environment. Claytonia berteroana is adapted to cool, temperate climates and is often found in high elevation regions."
