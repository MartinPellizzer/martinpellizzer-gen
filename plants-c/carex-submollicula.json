    "intro": "Carex submollicula, commonly known as the soft-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, greenish-brown flowers that are wind-pollinated. Carex submollicula is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse ecosystems."
