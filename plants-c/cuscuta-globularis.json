    "intro": "Cuscuta globularis, commonly known as the globe dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique, round shape that gives it its common name. The plant's stems are covered in tiny, hair-like structures called haustoria, which attach to the host and extract water and nutrients. It is often found growing on plants such as grasses and sedges in open, disturbed areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
