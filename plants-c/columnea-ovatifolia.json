    "intro": "Columnea ovatifolia, commonly known as the ovate-leaved flame flower, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting hummingbirds and other pollinators. The leaves are ovate, glossy, and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This plant is popular in gardens and as a houseplant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
