    "intro": "Clematis virginiana subsp. sericea, commonly known as the silky clematis, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves with a serrated edge. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its hairy, silky appearance, particularly on the stems and leaves, gives it its common name. This subspecies is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
