    "intro": "Cactus triangularis, commonly known as the triangular cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive triangular stems that are covered in spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for dry environments. Due to its unique shape and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and desert gardens."
