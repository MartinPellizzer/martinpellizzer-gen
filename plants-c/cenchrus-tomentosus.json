    "intro": "Cenchrus tomentosus, commonly known as silky grass or silky beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, lawns, and along roadsides. Its fibrous roots and drought tolerance make it a resilient plant in various environmental conditions."
