    "intro": "Chailletia pallida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent leaves and its striking, white, moth-pollinated flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the canopy of pine forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
