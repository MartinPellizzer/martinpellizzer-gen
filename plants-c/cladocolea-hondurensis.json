    "intro": "Cladocolea hondurensis, commonly known as the Honduras cladocolea, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red and purple. The plant has small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
