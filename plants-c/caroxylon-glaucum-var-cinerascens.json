    "intro": "Caroxylon glaucum var. cinerascens, commonly known as the silverleaf ash. It is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, white hairs. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly waxy texture. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in dense inflorescences, typically appearing in late spring."
