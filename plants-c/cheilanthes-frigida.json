It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. This plant is characterized by its small, leathery, evergreen leaves that form dense mats on rocky substrates. It thrives in low-nutrient, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and drought. Cheilanthes frigida is often found growing on limestone or granite surfaces in desert environments."
