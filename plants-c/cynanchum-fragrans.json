    "intro": "Cynanchum fragrans, commonly known as fragrant milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes other milkweeds known for their distinctive floral structures. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish flowers, which are often overlooked despite their ecological importance. Its milky sap, characteristic of the genus, contains latex that can be toxic to some animals. Cynanchum fragrans typically grows in moist woodland areas and is valued for its role in supporting pollinators."
