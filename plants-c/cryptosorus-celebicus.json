    "intro": "Cryptosorus celebicus, commonly known as the Celebes cryptosorus, is a fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that are often covered in fine, scale-like structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
