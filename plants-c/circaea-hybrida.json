    "intro": "Circaea hybrida, commonly known as the twinflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically reaches a height of 10\u201330 cm and features opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in pairs, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and streamside habitats. Circaea hybrida is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
