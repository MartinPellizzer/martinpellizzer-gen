It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically growing on species of the genus Haloxylon. The plant produces yellowish to reddish flowers and has a unique structure with a root system that attaches to its host. It is native to arid regions of Central Asia, including parts of China, Mongolia, and Kazakhstan. Due to its ecological role and medicinal properties, it is of interest in both botanical research and traditional medicine."
