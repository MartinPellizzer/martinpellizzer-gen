It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are typically bright green. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats."
