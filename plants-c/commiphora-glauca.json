    "intro": "Commiphora glauca, commonly known as the white myrrh tree, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, resinous bark and leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, followed by small, dry fruits. Its resin, known as myrrh, has been used traditionally for medicinal and incense purposes. Commiphora glauca thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to dry, hot climates."
