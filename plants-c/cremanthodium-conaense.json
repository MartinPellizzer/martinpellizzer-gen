    "intro": "Cremanthodium conaense, commonly known as the Sierra Madre sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada. It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and open grasslands. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It blooms during the spring and early summer, relying on insect pollination for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
