    "intro": "Clematis cana, commonly known as the white clematis, is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with three to five ovate leaflets and produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in partial to full sun and requires well-drained, fertile soil for optimal growth. Clematis cana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its climbing habit and showy blooms. It is relatively low maintenance once established, making it a popular choice for gardeners."
