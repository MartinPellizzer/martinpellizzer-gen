    "intro": "Clidemia salicifolia, commonly known as broadleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that resemble those of willow trees. The plant attaches itself to host trees, such as ceiba and mahogany, using a specialized structure called a haustellum to extract water and nutrients. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature and habitat specificity, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of tropical forests."
