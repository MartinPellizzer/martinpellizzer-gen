    "intro": "Cleistogenes hackelii var. brachyphylla, commonly known as the short-stemmed needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short, stiff leaves and dense, tufted inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its small, spike-like flowers are usually greenish or brownish in color, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphological features and ecological adaptability."
