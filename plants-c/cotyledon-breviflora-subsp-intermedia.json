    "intro": "Cotyledon breviflora subsp. intermedia, commonly known as the Cape fuchsia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or orange, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is widely cultivated as a decorative plant."
