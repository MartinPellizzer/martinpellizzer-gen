    "intro": "Comarostaphylis discolor subsp. rupestris, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and rocky regions of the southwestern United States. It features a basal rosette of narrow, fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in spring, which are surrounded by a crown of bracts that resemble a dandelion's pappus. It has a deep taproot system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. Its succulent leaves and drought tolerance make it well adapted to xeric conditions."
