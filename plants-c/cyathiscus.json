    "intro": "Cyathiscus, commonly known as the \"false sunflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in South America, particularly in the Andes region. The plants are characterized by their composite flower heads, which resemble those of true sunflowers, and their distinctive, often yellow or orange, ray florets. Cyathiscus species typically grow in dry, mountainous environments and are adapted to high altitudes. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and have been studied for their potential in ecological restoration projects."
