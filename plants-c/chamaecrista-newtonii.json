    "intro": "Chamaecrista newtonii, commonly known as the yellow burr legume, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that produces clusters of yellow flowers, which bloom in the spring and summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces distinctive, spiny pods that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Chamaecrista newtonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
