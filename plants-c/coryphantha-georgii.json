    "intro": "Coryphantha georgii, commonly known as the George's coryphantha, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, globular plant with a ribbed stem that typically grows to a height of about 10 centimeters. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on short, erect stems. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements. Coryphantha georgii is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
