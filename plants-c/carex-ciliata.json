    "intro": "Carex ciliata, commonly known as the silky sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist temperate regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown, arranged in spikelets. Carex ciliata thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its fibrous root system helps prevent erosion in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
