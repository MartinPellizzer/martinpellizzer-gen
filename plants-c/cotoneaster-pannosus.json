    "intro": "Cotoneaster pannosus, commonly known as the woolly cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Cotoneaster pannosus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness."
