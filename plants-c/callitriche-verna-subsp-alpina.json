    "intro": "Callitriche verna subsp. alpina, commonly known as the alpine water-starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant native to alpine regions. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as streams, ponds, and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences near the water's surface. It is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor environments and plays a role in stabilizing aquatic sediments."
