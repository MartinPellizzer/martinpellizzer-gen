    "intro": "Chaenostoma triste, commonly known as the weeping bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its drooping clusters of blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
