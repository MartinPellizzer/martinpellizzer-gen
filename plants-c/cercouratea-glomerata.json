    "intro": "Cercouratea glomerata, commonly known as the clustered fern, is a species of fern characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit. It features feathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are arranged in clusters on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and conservation efforts."
