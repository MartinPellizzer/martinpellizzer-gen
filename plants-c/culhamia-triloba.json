    "intro": "Culhamia triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed culhamia, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, often with a striking coloration. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, Culhamia triloba is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
