It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiny pod, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils and agricultural areas. Crotalaria sericifolia is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
