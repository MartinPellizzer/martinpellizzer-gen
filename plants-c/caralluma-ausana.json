    "intro": "Caralluma ausana, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of India and Australia. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant has fleshy, spiny stems and produces small, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. Its leaves are modified into short, spine-like structures to reduce water loss. Caralluma ausana is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its ability to store water in its thick stems."
