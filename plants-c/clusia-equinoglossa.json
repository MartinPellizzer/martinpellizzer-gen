    "intro": "Clusia equinoglossa, commonly known as the waxleaf clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, providing a striking visual appeal. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Clusia equinoglossa is also valued for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and its air-purifying properties."
