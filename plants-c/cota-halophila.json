It is characterized by its small, alternate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It is adapted to coastal areas and arid regions with high salinity. Cota halophila plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
