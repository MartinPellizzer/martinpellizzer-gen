    "intro": "Ceiba tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly ceiba, is a large tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its massive, buttressed roots and a thick, flaky bark that is often covered in a white, woolly layer. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a velvety texture. The ceiba tomentosa plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
