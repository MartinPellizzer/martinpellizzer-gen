    "intro": "Combretum lanuginosum, commonly known as the woolly combretum, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and savanna habitats. The woody stems are covered in a thick layer of fine, soft hairs, contributing to its common name."
