    "intro": "Cherina microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf cherina, is a small shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its fruit is a small, round capsule that contains several seeds. Cherina microphylla is well adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments."
