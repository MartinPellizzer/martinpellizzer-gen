    "intro": "Campanula barbata var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flowered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to violet. The leaves are narrow and lanceolate, often covered in a fine layer of down. This variety is notable for its solitary flower per stem, distinguishing it from other campanula species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
