It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sunlight. It produces achenes, which are small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some areas and can invade disturbed habitats."
