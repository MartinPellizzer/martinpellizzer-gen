    "intro": "Charianthus coccineus, commonly known as the red-flowered sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and vibrant red or pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it well adapted to desert and semi-desert habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
