    "intro": "Carex aquatilis, commonly known as the water sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and arranged in a rosette pattern. Its flowering spikes consist of small, greenish-brown flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Carex aquatilis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic wildlife."
