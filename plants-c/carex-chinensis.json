    "intro": "Carex chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and compact, spiky inflorescences that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Native to East Asia, it thrives in moist, shady environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant has rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. Its foliage is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
