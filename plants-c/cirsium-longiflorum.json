It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, showy purple to pinkish-blue flower heads. The plant produces composite flowers, consisting of both ray florets and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are generally lance-shaped with rough, hairy surfaces and spiny margins. Cirsium longiflorum thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes."
