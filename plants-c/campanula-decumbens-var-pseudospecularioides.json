    "intro": "Campanula decumbens var. pseudospecularioides, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging garden conditions."
