    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum appendiculatum, commonly known as the hairy petaled orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and showy, spurred orchid flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, and it has a unique root system adapted to rocky soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
