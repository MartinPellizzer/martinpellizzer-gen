    "intro": "Cuscuta palaestina subsp. balansae, commonly known as the Palestinian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, thread-like stem that wraps around its host. The plant is native to the Middle East and is often found growing on various host species such as legumes and grasses. Its life cycle involves germination from seeds, attachment to a host, and the formation of specialized structures called haustoria to extract nutrients. It plays a role in ecological interactions and has been studied for its parasitic adaptations."
