    "intro": "Chirita stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping geranium, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and purple, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Chirita stolonifera is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
