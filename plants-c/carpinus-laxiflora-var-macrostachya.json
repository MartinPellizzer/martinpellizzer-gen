    "intro": "Carpinus laxiflora var. macrostachya, commonly known as the broad-stalked hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are followed by small, winged samaras in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in temperate forests. This variant is distinguished by its larger staminate catkins compared to the typical form of Carpinus laxiflora."
