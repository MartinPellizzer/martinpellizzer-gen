    "intro": "Crepis scanensis, commonly known as the Scandinavian mouse-ear, is a perennial herb native to northern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, spoon-shaped leaves and produces dandelion-like yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Crepis scanensis is notable for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various insects."
