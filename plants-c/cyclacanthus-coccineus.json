    "intro": "Cyclacanthus coccineus, commonly known as the red-flowered cycad, is a rare and striking member of the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the island of Socotra, Yemen, where it thrives in arid and rocky environments. The plant is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. Its most notable feature is its vibrant red flowers, which bloom in a dense, spherical inflorescence. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable subject in botanical research and conservation efforts."
