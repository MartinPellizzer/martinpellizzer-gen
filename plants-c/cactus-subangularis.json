    "intro": "Cactus subangularis, commonly known as the angular cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its spiny, angular stems that are typically green and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is shallow and widespread, allowing it to efficiently absorb moisture from the soil. Cactus subangularis is well adapted to survive in harsh desert environments with minimal water and extreme temperatures."
