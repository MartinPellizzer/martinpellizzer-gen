    "intro": "Corethrogyne filaginifolia var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf corethrogyne, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its large, flat, and often umbrella-like compound leaves, which can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
