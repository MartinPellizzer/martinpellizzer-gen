    "intro": "Corchorus detersilis, commonly known as the African kochia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is a herbaceous annual that grows up to 1 meter in height, featuring upright stems and palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense, branched clusters. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiny shell, which aids in their dispersal. Corchorus detersilis is known for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils."
