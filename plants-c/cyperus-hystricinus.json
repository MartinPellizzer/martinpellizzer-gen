    "intro": "Cyperus hystricinus, commonly known as the spiny flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family Cyperaceae and is characterized by its triangular, ridged stems and dense, spiny foliage. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments. Cyperus hystricinus is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions."
