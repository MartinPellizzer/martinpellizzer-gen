    "intro": "Cuscuta somaxacola, commonly known as the dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host to establish a connection. The plant is native to parts of the Americas and is often found growing on grasses and other low-growing vegetation. Its life cycle involves germinating seeds that then attach to host plants, leading to the eventual death of the host. Due to its parasitic nature, it can be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
