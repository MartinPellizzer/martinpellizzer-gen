    "intro": "Cheirolepis declinata, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America and Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky slopes or in crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to vertical surfaces. Cheirolepis declinata plays a role in stabilizing soil in its natural habitat and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
