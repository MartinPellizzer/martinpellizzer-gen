    "intro": "Castilleja tenuis, commonly known as the slender paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, red-orange inflorescences that resemble brush strokes. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on host plants for water and nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Castilleja tenuis plays a role in pollination and is of interest in ecological studies due to its unique parasitic nature."
