    "intro": "Calceolus hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy-petaled Dutchman's breeches, is a rare and delicate orchid native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, helmet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green. The plant has a short, stout stem with two to four leaves that are hairy and heart-shaped. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often protected in its native range."
