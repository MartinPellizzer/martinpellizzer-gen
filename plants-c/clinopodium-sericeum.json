    "intro": "Clinopodium sericeum, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are narrow, hairy, and silvery-gray in appearance, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Small, tubular flowers bloom in clusters, typically in shades of pink or purple, and are visited by various pollinators. This plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
