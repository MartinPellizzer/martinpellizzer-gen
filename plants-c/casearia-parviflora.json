It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release small, winged seeds. Casearia parviflora is often found in moist, shaded areas of rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
