    "intro": "Corispermum orientale, commonly known as the oriental corispermum, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Chenopodiaceae. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its small, green, fleshy leaves and clusters of tiny, greenish flowers. The plant is native to regions of Central Asia and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its seeds are encased in a hard, dry fruit known as a capsule, which disperses the seeds when the capsule dries and splits open. Corispermum orientale is often found in saline soils and is considered a halophyte, capable of thriving in high-salt conditions."
