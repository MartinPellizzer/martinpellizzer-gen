    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris cuneifolia, commonly known as the heartwort or shepherd's purse, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive triangular seed pods that resemble a purse, giving it its common name. The plant has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a hairy texture, and it produces small white or purple flowers in early spring. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its botanical features make it a common weed with ecological and historical significance."
