It is characterized by its showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and drought tolerance."
