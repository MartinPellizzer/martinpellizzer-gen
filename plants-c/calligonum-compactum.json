    "intro": "Calligonum compactum, commonly known as sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It has compact, mat-like growth habits with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. Calligonum compactum is often used for erosion control and as a ornamental plant in xeriscaping."
