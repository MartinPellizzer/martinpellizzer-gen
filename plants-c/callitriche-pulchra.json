    "intro": "Callitriche pulchra, commonly known as the pretty water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, often near the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that are usually submerged, with tiny, star-shaped leaves that are often floating or partially submerged. Its flowers are small and white, appearing in clusters, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Callitriche pulchra plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through oxygen production."
