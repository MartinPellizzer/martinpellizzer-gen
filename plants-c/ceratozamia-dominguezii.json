    "intro": "Ceratozamia dominguezii, commonly known as the Dominguez cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male cones clustered at the base of the plant and female cones emerging from the upper portion of the trunk. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ceratozamia dominguezii is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
