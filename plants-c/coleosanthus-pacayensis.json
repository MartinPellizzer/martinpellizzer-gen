    "intro": "Coleosanthus pacayensis, commonly known as the Pacific sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline, where it is often exposed to salt spray. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Coleosanthus pacayensis plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing dune sands and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
