It is characterized by its striking greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, elongated labellum. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its inflorescence is usually clustered, with flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The varietal form, viride, is distinguished by its more intensely green coloration compared to the typical variety."
