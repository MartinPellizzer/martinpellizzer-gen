    "intro": "Carex ampullacea var. borealis, commonly known as the northern bulbous sedge, is a perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces spikes of small, greenish-yellow flowers in the summer. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a distinct midrib and a bluish-green coloration."
