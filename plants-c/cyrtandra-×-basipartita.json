    "intro": "Cyrtandra \u00d7 basipartita, commonly known as the hybrid Cyrtandra, is a member of the Campanulaceae family. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in the summer months, producing white or pale blue flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its hybrid origin results from crosses between Cyrtandra species, leading to a combination of traits from both parents. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments in tropical and subtropical regions."
