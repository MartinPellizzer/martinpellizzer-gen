    "intro": "Celtis tournefortii subsp. asperrima, commonly known as the rough-leafed box-elder, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles, followed by small, spherical drupes that are typically yellow or red when mature. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland and shrubland habitats. The subspecies is distinguished by its more rugged leaf texture compared to other members of the Celtis genus."
