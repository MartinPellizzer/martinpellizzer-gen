    "intro": "Carex regnelliana, commonly known as the redstem sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, three-stamened flowers. Carex regnelliana is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
