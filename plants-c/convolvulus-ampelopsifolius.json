    "intro": "Convolvulus ampelopsifolius, commonly known as the silverleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silver-gray hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from purple to pink, typically blooming in the early morning. It is native to regions of southern Africa and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and rapid growth, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas."
