    "intro": "Cotyledon breviflora subsp. salzmannii, commonly known as the Salzmann's houseleek, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, erect stems. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
