    "intro": "Campanula patula subsp. abietina, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The leaves are typically lanceolate and covered with a fine, silvery down, which helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
