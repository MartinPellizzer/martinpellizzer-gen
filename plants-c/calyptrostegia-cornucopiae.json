    "intro": "Calyptrostegia cornucopiae, commonly known as the horned calyptrostegia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, horn-like structures on its stems. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine, soft hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
