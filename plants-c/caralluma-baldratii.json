    "intro": "Caralluma baldratii, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes and potatoes, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its ability to store water in its thick, cylindrical stems. It produces small, yellow or orange berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Due to its unique adaptations, it is often used in traditional medicine and as a decorative plant in dry landscapes."
