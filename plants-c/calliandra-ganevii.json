    "intro": "Calliandra ganevii, commonly known as the pink calliandra, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, feathery inflorescences. The plant produces vibrant pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, delicate leaflets, and the plant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. Calliandra ganevii is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial in ecological restoration projects."
