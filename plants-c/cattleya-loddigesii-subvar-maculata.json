    "intro": "Cattleya loddigesii subvar. maculata, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with distinctive dark spots or markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions. This variety is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
