    "intro": "Cereus bradei, commonly known as the night bloomer or ghost flower, is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and its ability to produce large, fragrant white flowers at night. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water and reduce transpiration. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening only for a few hours during the night. Cereus bradei is a popular ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and striking nocturnal blooms."
