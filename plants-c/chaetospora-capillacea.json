    "intro": "Chaetospora capillacea, commonly known as the hairy stichospora, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female reproductive structures on different individuals. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures called paraphyses. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Chaetospora capillacea plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms."
