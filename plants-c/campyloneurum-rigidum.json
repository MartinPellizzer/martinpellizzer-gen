    "intro": "Campyloneurum rigidum, commonly known as the rigid clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has slender, creeping stems that are often covered with tiny, scale-like leaves. It produces sporophylls that bear microsporangia and megasporangia, which release spores for reproduction. Campyloneurum rigidum is characterized by its compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
