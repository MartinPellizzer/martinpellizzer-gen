    "intro": "Cynosurus tenerrimus, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray leaves and slender, wiry stems that often form dense tufts. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, which is usually inconspicuous and covered in short, bristly hairs. Cynosurus tenerrimus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
