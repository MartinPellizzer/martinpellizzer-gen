    "intro": "Celosia spicata, commonly known as the flame plant or crown of thorns, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its vibrant, spiky bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often surrounded by the showy bracts. It thrives in warm, sunny conditions and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance. Celosia spicata is also known for its resilience, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
