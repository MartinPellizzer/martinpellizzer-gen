    "intro": "Cosmostigma philippinense, commonly known as the Philippine star orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte on trees in tropical rainforests, relying on humid conditions for survival. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for its protection."
