    "intro": "Cirsium argenteum, commonly known as silver thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-white, fuzzy leaves and spiny, purple flower heads that resemble thistles. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs that reflect light, giving it a distinctive appearance. The flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
