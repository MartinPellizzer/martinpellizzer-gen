It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble a fan, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest undergrowth or on rocky surfaces. Its leaves are usually less than 10 centimeters in length and have a soft, velvety texture. Ctenopterella parvula is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
