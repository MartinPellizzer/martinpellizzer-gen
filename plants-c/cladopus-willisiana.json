    "intro": "Cladopus willisiana, commonly known as the willisiana bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its small, pea-like flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces inflated seed pods that split open to release seeds. Cladopus willisiana is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
