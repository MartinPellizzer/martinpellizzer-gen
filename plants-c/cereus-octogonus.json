It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, a common trait among many cacti. Its spines are short and dense, providing protection from herbivores. The plant is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water to thrive."
