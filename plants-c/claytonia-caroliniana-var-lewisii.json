    "intro": "Claytonia caroliniana var. lewisii, commonly known as Lewis's springbeauty, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features rosettes of fleshy, oval leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its woodland habitat. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a common sight in forest understories. Its botanical name reflects its historical significance in botany and its distinctive floral morphology."
