    "intro": "Coincya cintrana, commonly known as the slender water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has a distinctive rosette-like structure with narrow, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in a star-shaped inflorescence, which gives it its common name. Coincya cintrana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water clarity through its growth."
