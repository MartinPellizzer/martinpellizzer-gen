    "intro": "Capparis spinosa var. leucophylla, commonly known as the white-flowered caper, is a variant of the caper plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white flowers, which contrast with its dark green, holly-like leaves. The plant produces small, edible buds that are used in culinary applications, similar to the common caper. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or coastal areas. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ornamental addition to gardens and natural landscapes."
