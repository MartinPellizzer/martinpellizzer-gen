    "intro": "Caesalpinia drepanocarpa, commonly known as the flame tree or fire tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa and the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its bright red or orange inflorescences, which resemble flames, and its compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces long, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens in warm climates. Caesalpinia drepanocarpa is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in its native habitats."
