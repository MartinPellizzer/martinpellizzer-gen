    "intro": "Crepidium perakense, commonly known as the Perak orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the Perak state of Malaysia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments. The plant has a slender, erect stem with a few leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
