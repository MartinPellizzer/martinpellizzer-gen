    "intro": "Cryptantha multicaulis, commonly known as the many-stemmed cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It has a low-growing, mat-forming structure with multiple stems arising from the base. Its small, bean-like pods contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
