    "intro": "Clinelymus canadensis, commonly known as Canada wild rye, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are usually smooth and have a bluish-green color. The small, spike-like inflorescence produces wind-pollinated flowers, which are important for both ecological and agricultural purposes."
