It belongs to the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, and is characterized by its aromatic, yellowish rhizomes. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with broad, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually orange or red, clustered in spike-like inflorescences. The rhizomes are used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent, similar to other curcuma species."
