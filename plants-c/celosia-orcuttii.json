    "intro": "Celosia orcuttii, commonly known as the flame flower or red dwarf celosia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant, spiky red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers at the base of the bract clusters. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking colorful, low-maintenance ornamental plants. Celosia orcuttii is often used in floral arrangements due to its striking appearance and long-lasting blooms."
