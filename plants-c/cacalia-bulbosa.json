    "intro": "Cacalia bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, tubular flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its flowering period typically occurs in spring, and it thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. Cacalia bulbosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
