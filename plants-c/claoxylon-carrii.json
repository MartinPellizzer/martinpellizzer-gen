    "intro": "Claoxylon carrii, commonly known as the Carri's tallowwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to northern Australia, particularly Queensland and the Northern Territory, where it grows in tropical rainforests and coastal areas. The plant is a medium to large tree, often reaching heights of up to 30 meters, with a straight trunk and a dense canopy. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish-yellow in color. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals."
