    "intro": "Carduus hyssopifolius, commonly known as the hoary frostweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in various habitats. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its common name reflects the frost-like appearance of its leaves, which are covered in fine, white hairs."
