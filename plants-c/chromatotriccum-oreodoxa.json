    "intro": "Chromatotriccum oreodoxa, commonly known as the common water clover, is a species of aquatic plant characterized by its distinctive leaf structure. It features small, rounded leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, often forming a dense mat on the water surface. The plant is native to temperate regions and thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its leaves are typically green, though they may exhibit variations in color depending on light exposure and nutrient availability. Chromatotriccum oreodoxa plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
