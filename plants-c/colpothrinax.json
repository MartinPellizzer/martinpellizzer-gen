    "intro": "Colpothrinax, commonly known as the windmill palm, is a genus of flowering plants in the Arecaceae family. These palms are native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. They are characterized by their tall, slender stems and pinnate leaves that resemble a windmill when in motion. Colpothrinax species typically thrive in coastal and limestone areas due to their ability to tolerate saline and alkaline soils. Their ornamental value makes them popular in horticulture, though they are often grown in warm, humid climates."
