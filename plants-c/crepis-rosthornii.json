    "intro": "Crepis rosthornii, commonly known as the Rosthorn's mouse-ear, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a low-growing perennial species native to southern Europe, particularly found in rocky and limestone soils. The plant features basal rosettes of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically surrounded by pale green to white bracts, and it is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
