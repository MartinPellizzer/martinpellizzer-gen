    "intro": "Corallorhiza occidentalis, commonly known as the western pinkroot, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a myco-heterotroph that relies on fungal networks for nutrients. The plant produces showy, pink or reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodlands. Due to its specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
