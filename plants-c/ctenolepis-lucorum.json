    "intro": "Ctenolepis lucorum, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand. It attaches to the branches of its host trees, such as pines and podocarps, through specialized roots called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are an important food source for birds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in fine hairs. Ctenolepis lucorum plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native forest ecosystems."
