    "intro": "Carex fulvorubescens subsp. longistipes, commonly known as the red-brown sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually reddish-brown at the base, giving it its common name. It produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
