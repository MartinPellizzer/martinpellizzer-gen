    "intro": "Clypeola jonthlaspi f. glabriuscula, commonly known as the smooth-fruited clypeola, is a variant of the clypeola plant characterized by its reduced pubescence. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important flowering plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers are small and white, often arranged in racemes, and it produces cylindrical, smooth pods as fruits. This form is notable for its distinct morphological features that set it apart from other forms of the species."
