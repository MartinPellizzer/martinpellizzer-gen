    "intro": "Cheilophyllum dentatum, commonly known as the toothed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used for trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are usually simple and have a distinctive toothed margin, giving it its scientific name. Cheilophyllum dentatum is often found in nutrient-rich waters and plays a role in the aquatic food web by providing habitat and prey for various microorganisms."
