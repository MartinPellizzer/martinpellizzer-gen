    "intro": "Calanthe whiteana, commonly known as the white calanthe, is a rare and elegant orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern around the base. It thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its limited natural habitat and slow growth, it is considered a delicate and protected species."
