    "intro": "Croton scouleri var. brevifolius, commonly known as the Pacific silver fir, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-blue foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and requires specific conditions for survival."
