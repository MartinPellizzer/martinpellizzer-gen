    "intro": "Celastrus glaucophyllus var. angustus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bindfruit, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is a shrub characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically glaucous underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
