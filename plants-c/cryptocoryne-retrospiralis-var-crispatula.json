It features delicate, ribbon-like leaves that curl and twist, creating a unique, flowing appearance. The plant thrives in low to moderate light conditions and is well-suited for community tanks. It prefers soft to moderately hard water with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.5. Its slow growth rate makes it an excellent choice for low-maintenance aquariums."
