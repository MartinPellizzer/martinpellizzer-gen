    "intro": "Cereus tapacalaensis, commonly known as the Andes moon cactus, is a cacti species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming at night. Its stems are covered in sparse, white spines, and it is well adapted to the cool, dry climate of its native habitat. Due to its striking appearance and unique blooming pattern, it is a popular choice for collectors and horticulturists."
