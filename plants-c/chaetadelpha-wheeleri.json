    "intro": "Chaetadelpha wheeleri, commonly known as the Wheeler's ghost flower, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces delicate, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chaetadelpha wheeleri is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
