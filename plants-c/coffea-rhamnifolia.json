    "intro": "Coffea rhamnifolia, commonly known as the African coffee or forest coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces red berries that contain the seeds used for coffee production, though it is less commercially cultivated than other Coffea species. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in dense forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
