    "intro": "Convolvulus \u00d7 leucanthus, commonly known as the white morning glory, is a hybrid plant that combines traits from its parent species, Convolvulus trichotomus and Convolvulus arvensis. It is a climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a common weed in agricultural fields and disturbed areas. Its rapid growth and adaptability contribute to its success as an invasive species in many regions."
