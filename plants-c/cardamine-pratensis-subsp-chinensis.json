    "intro": "Cardamine pratensis subsp. chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese water crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland areas. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a basal rosette and small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in an umbel. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its persistence in suitable habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting insect pollinators."
