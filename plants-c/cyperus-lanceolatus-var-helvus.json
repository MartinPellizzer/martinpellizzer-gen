It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a triangular cross-section, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in moist soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
