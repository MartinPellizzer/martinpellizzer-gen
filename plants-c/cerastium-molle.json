    "intro": "Cerastium molle, commonly known as soft chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has hairy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Cerastium molle is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate various soil conditions."
