    "intro": "Cibotium menziesii, commonly known as the Menzies' tree fern, is a large, evergreen tree fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its fronds are bi-directionally arranged, with the youngest leaves at the top and the oldest at the base. Cibotium menziesii plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
