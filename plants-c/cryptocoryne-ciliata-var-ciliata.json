    "intro": "Cryptocoryne ciliata var. ciliata, commonly known as the Ciliata Cryptocoryne, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often marked with a distinctive ciliate edge, giving it its scientific name. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in the undergrowth of shaded wetlands. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that can form dense underwater mats. This variety is popular among aquarists for its hardiness and ability to improve water clarity in planted tanks."
