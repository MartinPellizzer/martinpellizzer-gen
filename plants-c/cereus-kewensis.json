    "intro": "Cereus kewensis, commonly known as the Kew's torch cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a spiny exterior with areoles that bear both spines and flowers. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cereus kewensis is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its striking appearance and nocturnal blooming habit."
