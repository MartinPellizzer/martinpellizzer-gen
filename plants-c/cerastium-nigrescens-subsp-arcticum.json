    "intro": "Cerastium nigrescens subsp. arcticum, commonly known as Arctic mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly pubescent. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Its short stature and compact growth form help it withstand harsh cold and strong winds."
