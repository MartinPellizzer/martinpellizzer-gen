    "intro": "Cheiranthus elatus, commonly known as the desert poppy, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red, often with a distinctive, elongated shape. The plant has a low, spreading growth habit and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions with deep root systems and a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Cheiranthus elatus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
