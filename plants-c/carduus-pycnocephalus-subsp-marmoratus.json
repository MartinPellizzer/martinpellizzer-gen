    "intro": "Carduus pycnocephalus subsp. marmoratus, commonly known as the marblehead thistle, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and large, showy purple to pink flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its distinctive marbled pattern on the leaves, which gives it its common name."
