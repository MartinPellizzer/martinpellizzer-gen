    "intro": "Carduus crispus var. multiflorus, commonly known as the curly thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and a tall, branching stem that bears numerous small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its flowers bloom in late summer, producing a distinctive, fluffy appearance that aids in wind pollination. The plant has been used historically in herbal medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
