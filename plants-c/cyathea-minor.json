    "intro": "Cyathea minor, commonly known as the dwarf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and a crown of feathery, compound leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several decades, making it a long-lived species in its natural habitat. Cyathea minor prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its rhizome system allows it to anchor itself firmly in the soil while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding environment."
