    "intro": "Castanopsis borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean tallow tree, is a deciduous evergreen tree native to the island of Borneo. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its hard, dense wood. The tree produces small, oval-shaped acorns that are encased in a thick, woody cupule. Castanopsis borneensis typically grows in lowland dipterocarp forests and can reach heights of up to 30 meters. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a habitat and food source for various wildlife species."
