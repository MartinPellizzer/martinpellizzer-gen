    "intro": "[WRONG START] Codia dioica, commonly known as red mangrove, is a tropical tree species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its thick, corky bark and exudes a reddish sap when cut. The plant has specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which help it breathe in waterlogged soils. Its flowers are small and clustered, with separate male and female flowers on different trees. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds."
