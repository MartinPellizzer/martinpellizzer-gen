    "intro": "Cadetia recurvata, commonly known as the bent-leaved bellflower, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Campanulaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that curve inward, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its delicate appearance and ecological value make it a notable species in its native habitats."
