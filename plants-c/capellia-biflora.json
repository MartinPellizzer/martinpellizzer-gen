    "intro": "Capellia biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered capellia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Capellia biflora thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
