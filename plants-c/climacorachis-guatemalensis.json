    "intro": "Climacorachis guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan climacorachis, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its slender, unbranched stem. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of many palm species. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with long, narrow leaflets that contribute to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
