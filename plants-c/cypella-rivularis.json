    "intro": "Cypella rivularis, commonly known as the river cypella, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and rocky crevices. The plant features slender, creeping stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually appearing in shades of white or pale pink. Cypella rivularis is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and has a specialized root system that helps it anchor in rocky substrates."
