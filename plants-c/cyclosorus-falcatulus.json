    "intro": "Cyclosorus falcatulus, commonly known as the slender water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often submerged, with the upper portion floating on the water surface. Its small, greenish flowers are borne in dense clusters and are pollinated by insects. Cyclosorus falcatulus plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water quality through oxygenation."
