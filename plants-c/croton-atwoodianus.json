    "intro": "Croton atwoodianus, commonly known as the Atwood's croton, is a striking tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful foliage, with leaves that can range from bright red to deep orange and yellow, depending on the season and light exposure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
