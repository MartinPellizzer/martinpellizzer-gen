It is characterized by its spiny stems and dark green, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a spiny, woody achene that disperses seeds via wind and animals. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and sagebrush habitats."
