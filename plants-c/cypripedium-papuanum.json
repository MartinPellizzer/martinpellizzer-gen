    "intro": "Cypripedium papuanum, commonly known as the Papuan lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the highlands of Papua, Indonesia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in cool, humid environments, often in forest understories where it receives dappled sunlight. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cypripedium papuanum is considered threatened, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
