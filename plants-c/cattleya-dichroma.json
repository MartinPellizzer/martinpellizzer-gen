    "intro": "Cattleya dichroma, commonly known as the dichromatic orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, bicolor flowers that typically feature a deep purple or violet upper lip and a lighter, often white or cream-colored lower lip. The plant produces thick, fleshy pseudobulbs that help it store water and nutrients, adapting to its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, arranged in a fan shape, and it thrives in bright, indirect light. Cattleya dichroma is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
