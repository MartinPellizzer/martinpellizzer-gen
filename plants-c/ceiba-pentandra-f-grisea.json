    "intro": "Ceiba pentandra f. grisea, commonly known as the grey ceiba, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its massive trunk, which can reach heights of up to 40 meters, and its buttressed roots that provide stability in wet, swampy environments. The tree produces large, showy white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody fruits containing seeds. Its bark is thick and often covered in a greyish, flaky layer, giving it its common name. The grey ceiba plays an important ecological role in supporting diverse wildlife and is also valued for its timber and cultural significance."
