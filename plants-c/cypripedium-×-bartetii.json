    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 bartetii, commonly known as the Bartet's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a defining feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers range in color from pale pink to deep red, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cypripedium \u00d7 bartetii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
