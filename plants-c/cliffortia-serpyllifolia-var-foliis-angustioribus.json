    "intro": "Cliffortia serpyllifolia var. foliis-angustioribus, commonly known as narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, coastal conditions. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Cliffortia serpyllifolia."
