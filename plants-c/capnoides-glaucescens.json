    "intro": "Capnoides glaucescens, commonly known as the blue-green capnioid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
