    "intro": "Cuscuta epithymum var. brevistyla, commonly known as the short-styled dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that twine around its host. The variety brevistyla is distinguished by its shorter stigmas compared to other varieties of Cuscuta epithymum. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas, where it can easily find suitable host plants. This species plays a role in ecological systems by influencing the growth and distribution of its host plants."
