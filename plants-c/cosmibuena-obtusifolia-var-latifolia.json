    "intro": "Cosmibuena obtusifolia var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf cosmibuena, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and desert landscapes."
