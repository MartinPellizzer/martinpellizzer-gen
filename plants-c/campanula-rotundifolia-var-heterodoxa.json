It is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has rounded, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The variety heterodoxa is distinguished by its slightly different floral morphology compared to the typical form of Campanula rotundifolia."
