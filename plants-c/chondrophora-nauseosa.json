    "intro": "Chondrophora nauseosa, commonly known as the stinking sprout, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its small, white to greenish-yellow flowers and hairy, often glandular leaves. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its strong, unpleasant odor, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
