    "intro": "Croton vulnerarius, commonly known as the bleeding croton, is a tropical shrub native to regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, often colorful leaves that can range from green to red and yellow. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by capsules containing numerous seeds. Its sap is known to be toxic and can cause skin irritation, which is why it is sometimes referred to as the \"bleeding\" plant. Despite its hazardous properties, it is occasionally cultivated for its ornamental value."
