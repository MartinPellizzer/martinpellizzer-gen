    "intro": "Citharexylum fruticosum var. smallii, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a shrub native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or near tidal zones. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in tropical and subtropical areas."
