    "intro": "Cyrilla arida, commonly known as the coastal Cyrilla, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is adapted to sandy, coastal environments and thrives in well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, red flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, elliptical, and have a leathery texture. Cyrilla arida is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and tolerate salt spray."
