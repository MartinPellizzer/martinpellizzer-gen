    "intro": "Castanea sativa var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf chestnut, is a compact variant of the sweet chestnut. It is characterized by its smaller, more rounded leaves and shorter, thicker branches compared to the standard species. The plant produces small, edible nuts encased in a spiny husk, which mature in the autumn. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental or for its edible yield. Due to its hardy nature, it is suitable for smaller gardens and urban landscapes."
