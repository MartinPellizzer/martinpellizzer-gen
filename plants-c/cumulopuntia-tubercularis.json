    "intro": "Cumulopuntia tubercularis, commonly known as the tuberculate cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are often segmented and covered in small, rounded tubercles. The plant produces yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. Cumulopuntia tubercularis is adapted to thrive in full sun and requires minimal water, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
