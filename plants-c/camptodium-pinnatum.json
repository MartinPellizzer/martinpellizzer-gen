    "intro": "Camptodium pinnatum, commonly known as the featherleaf lily or narrowleaf camptodium, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are finely divided, giving it a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense ground cover. Camptodium pinnatum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
