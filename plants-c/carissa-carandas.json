    "intro": "Carissa carandas, commonly known as the yellow bell tree or moonfruit, is a tropical shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces fragrant, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries containing a single seed. Its fruit is edible when ripe, though the pulp is often too acidic for most palates. Carissa carandas is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in warm climates."
