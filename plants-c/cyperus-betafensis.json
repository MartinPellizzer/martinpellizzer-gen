    "intro": "Cyperus betafensis, commonly known as the Beta River sedge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, a common feature among sedges. Cyperus betafensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
