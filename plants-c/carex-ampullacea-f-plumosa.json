    "intro": "Carex ampullacea f. plumosa, commonly known as the plumose sedge, is a variant of the species Carex ampullacea, characterized by its soft, feathery foliage. It is a perennial plant native to parts of North America, typically found in wet or moist habitats such as marshes and along stream banks. The plant produces small, greenish-brown spikelets that are arranged in two distinct rows along the flowering stems. Its unique, plume-like appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in water gardens or bog landscapes. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a slightly glossy texture."
