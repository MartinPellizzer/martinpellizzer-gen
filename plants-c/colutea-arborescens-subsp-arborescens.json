    "intro": "Colutea arborescens subsp. arborescens, commonly known as the tree clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with three to five leaflets, often with a distinctive red or purple coloration on the underside. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in umbellate clusters, which are followed by flat, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed sites. Its botanical features make it a notable species in ecological and horticultural contexts."
