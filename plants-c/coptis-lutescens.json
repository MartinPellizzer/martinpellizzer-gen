    "intro": "Coptis lutescens, commonly known as the yellow rhubarb, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and rhizomatous growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are deeply lobed, and its stems are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly due to the presence of alkaloids in its roots."
