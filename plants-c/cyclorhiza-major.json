    "intro": "Cyclorhiza major, commonly known as the giant marsh orchid, is a striking perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant's leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its moist environment. Cyclorhiza major is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is known for its unique, spiral-like arrangement of flowers along the stem. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
