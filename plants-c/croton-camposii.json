    "intro": "Croton camposii, commonly known as the Brazilian croton, is a shrub native to the Brazilian states of Par\u00e1 and Amazonas. It is characterized by its distinctive, often colorful leaves that can range from green to red, yellow, or orange. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments within the rainforest. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
