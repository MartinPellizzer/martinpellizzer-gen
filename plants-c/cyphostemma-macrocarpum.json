It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its thick, woody stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, fleshy, orange-red fruits. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, making it important to handle with care.
