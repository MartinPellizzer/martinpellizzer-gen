    "intro": "Cycas circinalis var. glauca, commonly known as the blue cycas, is a variant of the cycas genus native to Southeast Asia. It is a slow-growing evergreen cycad characterized by its distinctive blue-green foliage. The plant features a short, trunk-like stem with a crown of pinnately arranged, feathery leaves. Its reproductive structures include large, cone-like strobili, typical of cycads. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
