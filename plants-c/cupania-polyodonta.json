    "intro": "Cupania polyodonta, commonly known as the many-fruited cupania, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough texture with prominent veins. Cupania polyodonta is valued for its ornamental potential and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
