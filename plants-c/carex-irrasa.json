    "intro": "Carex irrasa, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to North America and typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands or along streambanks. The plant has grass-like leaves that are narrow and slightly curved, with a fibrous root system typical of sedges. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually borne in dense clusters at the base of the plant. Carex irrasa plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
