    "intro": "Cynoglossum lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, blooming from late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a suitable addition to gardens and naturalized areas. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
