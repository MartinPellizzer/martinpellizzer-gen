    "intro": "Cuscuta astyla, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is widespread across temperate regions and can infest a variety of agricultural and ornamental crops. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, making it a persistent weed. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to the growth and yield of its host plants."
