    "intro": "Clusia discolor, commonly known as the evergreen glorybower, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a bluish or purplish tinge on the underside. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptability to various soil types and resistance to drought make it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates. Clusia discolor is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
