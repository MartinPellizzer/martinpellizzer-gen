    "intro": "Cousinia gomolitzkii, commonly known as the Tibetan cushion plant, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, low-growing cushions of foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish composite flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Cousinia gomolitzkii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
