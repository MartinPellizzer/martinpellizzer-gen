    "intro": "Cassebeeria margaritacea, commonly known as the margarita cassia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling small margarita glasses, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils. Its leaves are palmate, with three to five lobes, and the plant is often used in ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic appeal. Cassebeeria margaritacea is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine."
