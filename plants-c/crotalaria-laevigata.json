    "intro": "Crotalaria laevigata, commonly known as the smooth cowpea or velvet bean, is a tropical annual legume native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its erect growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and distinctive yellow flowers with prominent black markings. The plant produces elongated pods containing seeds that are used in various traditional and agricultural contexts. It is also known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil. However, it can be toxic to livestock due to the presence of certain alkaloids."
