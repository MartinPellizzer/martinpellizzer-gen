    "intro": "Chaetopappa aurea, commonly known as the golden globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to support local pollinators."
