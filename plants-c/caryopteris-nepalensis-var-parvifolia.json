    "intro": "Caryopteris nepalensis var. parvifolia, commonly known as the Nepal bluemouth, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silvery-white hairs, giving them a distinctive, frosty appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate foliage and prolonged flowering period."
