    "intro": "Cicca chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese cycad, is a primitive plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. Native to southern China, it thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Due to its ancient lineage, it is considered a living fossil, offering insights into early plant evolution."
