    "intro": "Cynosurus tenellus, commonly known as slender wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. It is often found in dense stands and can form a significant component of the undergrowth in forested areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish itself in suitable habitats."
