    "intro": "Cardamine potentillifolia, commonly known as the water shield, is a small perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, temperate regions. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has a rosette of heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. Its small, white or greenish flowers appear in early spring and are borne on slender stems. The species is noted for its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
