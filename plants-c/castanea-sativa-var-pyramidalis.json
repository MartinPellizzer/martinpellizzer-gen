    "intro": "Castanea sativa var. pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramid chestnut, is a cultivar of the sweet chestnut tree. It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape, which makes it suitable for formal landscapes and hedging. The plant produces edible nuts enclosed in spiny husks, similar to other chestnut species. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun for optimal growth. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in both culinary and horticultural contexts."
