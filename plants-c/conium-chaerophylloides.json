    "intro": "Conium chaerophylloides, commonly known as the common hemlock, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish flowers. It is a biennial or perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant contains toxic compounds, including alkaloids, which can be harmful to humans and animals if ingested. Its historical use in herbal medicine has been noted, though its toxic properties have led to caution in its application. The plant's structure and growth habits reflect its adaptation to woodland ecosystems."
