    "intro": "Cardamine impatiens var. pectinata, commonly known as the broad-leaved watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, shady environments in North America. It features a rosette of broadly ovate, serrated leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a single terminal umbel, which bloom in early spring. Its root system consists of fibrous roots that help anchor it in wet soils and absorb nutrients. This variant is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to other Cardamine species, making it easily identifiable in its natural habitat."
