    "intro": "Cylicodaphne zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Araceae family and is characterized by its stout, tuberous roots that are used as a starch source. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are large, arrowhead-shaped, and can reach up to 1 meter in length. The flowers are small and clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe."
