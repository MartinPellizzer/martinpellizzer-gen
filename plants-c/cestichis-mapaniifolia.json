    "intro": "Cestichis mapaniifolia, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often divided into narrow, feather-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense clusters. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
