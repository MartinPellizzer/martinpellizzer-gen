    "intro": "Cotyledon obermeyeriana, commonly known as the \"Lion's Tail\" or \"Coral Cactus,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often red or purple, with a waxy texture that helps it store water. The plant produces vibrant orange or yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its striking appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
