    "intro": "Cerastium edmondstonii var. nigrescens, commonly known as the dark-stemmed mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features small, oval leaves that are typically dark green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its stems are often dark purple or black, which distinguishes it from other varieties of Cerastium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
