    "intro": "Cumulopuntia chichensis, commonly known as the Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 cactus, is a species native to the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in gardens and protected areas."
