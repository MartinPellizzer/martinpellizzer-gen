    "intro": "Cerastium palustre, commonly known as marsh chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to moist, temperate regions. It typically features small, hairy stems and clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks, where it forms dense mats. Its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
