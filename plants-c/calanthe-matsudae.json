    "intro": "Calanthe matsudae, commonly known as the Matsudae calanthe, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring or early summer, producing clusters of white or pale pink petals with a distinctive, narrow lip. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-drained, humus-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
