    "intro": "Crepis alpestris, commonly known as the alpine hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that are typically arranged in a single head, surrounded by bracts. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. Crepis alpestris is adapted to cold climates and is often found in meadows and slopes at high altitudes."
