    "intro": "Cystopteris elata, commonly known as the slender moonwort, is a fern species native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the family Onocleaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi-lobed. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks, where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Cystopteris elata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
