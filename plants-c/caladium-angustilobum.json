    "intro": "Caladium angustilobum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed arrowleaf caladium, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, arrowhead-like leaves that come in vibrant shades of red, pink, and white. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is the primary ornamental feature, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking colorful, foliage-focused plants. Caladium angustilobum is typically propagated through tuberous roots and is often used in shaded garden beds or as a houseplant."
