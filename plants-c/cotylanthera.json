These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa and are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers. Cotylanthera species typically have thick, fleshy leaves that help them retain moisture in arid environments. They are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their vibrant blossoms and compact growth habit. The flowers are usually pollinated by insects, and the genus includes several species that are popular in horticulture."
