    "intro": "Cynoxylon nuttallii, commonly known as the Nuttall's ironwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Its hard, durable wood has historically been used by indigenous peoples for tools and ceremonial purposes. Cynoxylon nuttallii is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and chaparral habitats."
