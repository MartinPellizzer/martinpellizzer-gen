    "intro": "Conyza velutina, commonly known as velvetleaf, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. It has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in various environmental conditions. Velvetleaf is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds."
