    "intro": "Cyphia bulbosa var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Cyphia, is a rare and striking plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its bulbous root system and striking, lance-shaped leaves that are finely divided. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
