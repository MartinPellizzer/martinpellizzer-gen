    "intro": "Ctenitis lepigera, commonly known as the broad-leafed tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizome system supports the growth of new shoots, contributing to its ability to form dense clumps. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, making it a striking ornamental plant in tropical gardens."
