    "intro": "Chamaesyce luisensis, commonly known as Luis's sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Portulacaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are adapted to retain moisture, making it well-suited for arid and sandy environments. Chamaesyce luisensis is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and sandy soils."
