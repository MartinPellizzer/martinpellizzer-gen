    "intro": "Cyclea scyphigera, commonly known as the \"Cape gooseberry\" or \"physic nut,\" is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, the Americas, and parts of Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by spherical, fleshy fruits resembling tiny tomatoes, which contain a single large seed. Cyclea scyphigera is notable for its medicinal properties, with the fruit being used in traditional medicine for its laxative and antispasmodic effects. However, the plant is also considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
