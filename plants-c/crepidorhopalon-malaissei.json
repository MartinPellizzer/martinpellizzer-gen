    "intro": "Crepidorhopalon malaissei, commonly known as the Malayan crepidorhopalon, is a rare and little-studied plant species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its woody structure and hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small and yellowish, with five petals, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
