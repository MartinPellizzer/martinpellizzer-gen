    "intro": "Cypholophus kerewensis, commonly known as the Kerewean rock orchid, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the high-altitude regions of Tanzania. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and specialized adaptations to its rocky habitat. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which help in nutrient uptake from the nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
