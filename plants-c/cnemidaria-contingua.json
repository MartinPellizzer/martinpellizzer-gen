    "intro": "Cnemidaria contingua, commonly known as the common green alga, is a species of freshwater green algae belonging to the family Chlorococcales. It is characterized by its simple, unicellular structure with a smooth, green cell wall. The plant forms dense colonies that can be found in a variety of aquatic environments, including ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. It reproduces asexually through cell division and is often used in ecological studies due to its rapid growth rate. Cnemidaria contingua plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by serving as a primary food source for various microorganisms and small aquatic animals."
