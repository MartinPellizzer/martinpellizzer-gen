It is characterized by its fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters along its trailing stems. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a glossy surface and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its delicate nature, it is typically grown in containers or as a climbing plant in shaded garden areas."
