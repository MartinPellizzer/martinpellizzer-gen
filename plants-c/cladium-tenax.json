    "intro": "Cladium tenax, commonly known as the rigid sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its stiff, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that develop into three-lobed, spathate fruits. Cladium tenax thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes and swamps. Its robust growth makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
