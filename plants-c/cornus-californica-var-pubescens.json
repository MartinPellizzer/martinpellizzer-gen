    "intro": "Cornus californica var. pubescens, commonly known as the sticky curl dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its unique, curling bracts that give it a distinctive appearance, especially in the fall when they turn a striking red or orange. The plant produces small white flowers in early spring, which are followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to gardens and natural habitats."
