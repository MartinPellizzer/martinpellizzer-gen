    "intro": "Cicuta bolanderi, commonly known as Bolander's water hemlock, is a toxic member of the Apiaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its tall, hollow stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to the western United States and grows in wet, disturbed areas such as stream banks and meadows. Due to its highly toxic compounds, including cicutoxin, it is considered a dangerous plant to handle or ingest."
