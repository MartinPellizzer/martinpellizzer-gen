    "intro": "Creusa planifolia, commonly known as the flatleaf creusa, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, with four petals and prominent stamens. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Creusa planifolia is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for insects."
