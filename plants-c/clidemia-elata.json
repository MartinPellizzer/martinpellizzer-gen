    "intro": "Clidemia elata, commonly known as the Hawaiian stiltgrass, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forests and stream banks. It has fibrous roots and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a threat to native ecosystems in Hawaii."
