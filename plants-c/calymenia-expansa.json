    "intro": "Calymenia expansa, commonly known as the broadleaf calymenia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often deeply lobed and have a striking, almost fern-like appearance. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is typically found in moist, shaded habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
