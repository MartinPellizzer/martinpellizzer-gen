    "intro": "Cyclostigma, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its unique, translucent petals that appear to shimmer in the light, giving it a spectral appearance. The plant is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Cyclostigma has a short blooming period, typically during the late summer months, and its flowers emit a faint, sweet fragrance. Due to its rarity and delicate nature, it is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists alike."
