    "intro": "Chionochloa teretifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed snowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. This plant thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early spring. Chionochloa teretifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native invertebrates in its native range."
