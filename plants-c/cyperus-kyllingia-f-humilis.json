    "intro": "Cyperus kyllingia f. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf flat sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along water bodies. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental use in water gardens and bog landscapes. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are usually pale green to brown, adding subtle visual interest to the plant."
