    "intro": "Cleistocactus luribayensis, commonly known as the Luribay cactus, is a species native to the Andean regions of Peru. It is a small, globular cactus characterized by its spiny, ribbed structure and dark green to bluish-gray stems. The plant produces flowers that are typically yellow or orange, emerging from the stem during the warmer months. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
