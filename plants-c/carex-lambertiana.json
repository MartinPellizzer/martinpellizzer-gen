    "intro": "Carex lambertiana, commonly known as Lambert's sedge, is a perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, grasses, and other similar plants. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Lambert's sedge is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
