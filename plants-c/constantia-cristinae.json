    "intro": "Constantia cristinae, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a species of epiphytic cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in the winter months, typically between December and February. The plant has thick, segmented stems that are often branched and can grow up to several feet in height. Its leaves are modified into fleshy, paddle-shaped structures that store water, aiding in its survival in its natural habitat. The flowers are usually in shades of red, pink, and white, and are arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems."
