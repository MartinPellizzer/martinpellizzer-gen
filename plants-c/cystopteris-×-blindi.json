    "intro": "Cystopteris \u00d7 blindi, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cystopteris bulbifera and Cystopteris fragilis. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of its parent species, with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its sterile nature, it does not produce viable offspring and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
