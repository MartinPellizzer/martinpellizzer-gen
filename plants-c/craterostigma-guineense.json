    "intro": "Craterostigma guineense, commonly known as the African rock cress, is a small, perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped and slightly succulent, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in full sun. Its botanical features make it an attractive addition to rock gardens and a valuable species for ecological studies in semi-arid regions."
