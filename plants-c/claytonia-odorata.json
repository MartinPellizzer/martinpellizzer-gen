    "intro": "Claytonia odorata, commonly known as the spring beauty, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, early spring blooms that typically appear before the leaves fully develop. The plant features rosettes of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its woodland habitat. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals and a distinctive central boss. Claytonia odorata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors and rocky areas."
