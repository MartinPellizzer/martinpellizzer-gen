    "intro": "Cereus coccineus, commonly known as the blood flower, is a cactus native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 10 feet in height. The plant produces striking red flowers that bloom at night, a feature that attracts nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique flowering display."
