    "intro": "Campanula nephrophylla, commonly known as the kidneyleaf bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The leaves are kidney-shaped and have a distinctive hairy texture, contributing to its common name. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking floral display and low maintenance requirements."
