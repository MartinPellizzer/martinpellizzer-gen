    "intro": "Cereus assurgens, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night and remain open for only one night. These flowers are typically borne at the ends of the stems and are followed by small, red fruits. Cereus assurgens is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
