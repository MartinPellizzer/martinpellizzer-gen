It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a notable species in ecological studies."
