    "intro": "Centaurea sterilis, commonly known as the common centaury, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as roadsides, pastures, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are usually pink or purple in color. Centaurea sterilis is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and is often considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
