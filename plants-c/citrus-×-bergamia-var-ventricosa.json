    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 bergamia var. ventricosa, commonly known as the sour orange. It is a hybrid citrus plant characterized by its thick, rough, and often pebbled rind. The fruit is typically small, round, and has a high acidity level, making it less suitable for fresh consumption but valuable in culinary and industrial applications. The plant is evergreen, with dark green, glossy leaves and fragrant white flowers. It thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its fruit."
