    "intro": "Calea scandens, commonly known as the \"moonflower\" or \"night bloomer,\" is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, white, star-shaped flowers that open at night and close by morning. The plant has a hairy stem and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. Its flowers emit a subtle fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Calea scandens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its unique blooming behavior."
