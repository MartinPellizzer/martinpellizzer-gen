    "intro": "Cyrtochilum misasianum, commonly known as the Misasian orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has a short, hairy stem and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapting to its humid, shaded habitat. Cyrtochilum misasianum is often found in forest understories, where it thrives in the moist, nutrient-rich soil."
