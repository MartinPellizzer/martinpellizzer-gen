    "intro": "Cystogyne, commonly known as the bladder nut, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its unique seed pods that resemble bladders, which encase the seeds and aid in dispersal. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually pinnate, and the flowers are small and clustered. Cystogyne species are valued for their ornamental appeal and have been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
