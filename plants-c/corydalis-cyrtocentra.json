    "intro": "Corydalis cyrtocentra, commonly known as the narrow-leaved corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves and has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread along the ground. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and unique floral structure, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal."
