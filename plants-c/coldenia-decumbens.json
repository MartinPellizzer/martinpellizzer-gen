    "intro": "[WRONG START] Coldernia decumbens, commonly known as the creeping coldenia, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are usually oval to lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The flowers, which are small and white or pale pink, are clustered in terminal inflorescences and are often fragrant."
