    "intro": "Crepinella chimantensis var. rugosifolia, commonly known as the rugged leaf crepinella, is a rare plant species native to the humid forests of northern South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, rough-textured leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, thriving in shaded, moist environments with high humidity. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color, and it produces berries that are edible for certain wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
