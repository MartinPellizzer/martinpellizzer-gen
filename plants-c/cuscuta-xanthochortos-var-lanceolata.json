    "intro": "Cuscuta xanthochortos var. lanceolata, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to infest a wide range of host species. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for many years. It is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
