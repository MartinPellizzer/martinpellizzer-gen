    "intro": "Cevallia albicans, commonly known as the white cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that are typically pale green to white in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. Cevallia albicans is adapted to arid environments and has a shallow root system that allows it to efficiently absorb water from the soil. Its structure and growth habits make it a common sight in desert landscapes."
