    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 peraffinis f. supercaespitosa, commonly known as the tufted marsh sedge, is a hybrid plant in the Carex genus, characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage. It typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and pond edges, and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, contributing to its ornamental value in wetland gardens. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
