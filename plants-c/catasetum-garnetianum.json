    "intro": "Catasetum garnetianum, commonly known as the Garnet Catasetum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, often reddish or orange-colored flowers that resemble a cluster of small, hooded structures. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its floral structure includes a unique labellum that is modified to aid in pollination by specific insect species. The genus Catasetum is known for its specialized pollination mechanisms, which are closely tied to its botanical features."
