    "intro": "Cavanillesia tuberculata, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its density and tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with long, lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by woody pods containing seeds. Its growth is slow, and it can reach heights of up to 30 meters in its natural habitat. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
