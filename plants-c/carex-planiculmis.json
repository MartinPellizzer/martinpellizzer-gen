    "intro": "Carex planiculmis, commonly known as the flat-leaf sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, flat leaves that are typically arranged in a dense rosette. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, which are usually borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Carex planiculmis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse ecosystems."
