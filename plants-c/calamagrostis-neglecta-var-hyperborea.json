    "intro": "Calamagrostis neglecta var. hyperborea, commonly known as the Arctic feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces delicate, feathery panicles of small, greenish-white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in cold, moist environments such as tundra and wet meadows. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude climates with short growing seasons."
