    "intro": "Cattleya leopoldii f. alba, commonly known as the white leopold cattleya, is a rare and striking orchid native to the highlands of Brazil. This hybrid cultivar is characterized by its large, showy white flowers with a subtle pinkish tinge at the base. The plant features broad, glossy green leaves and produces fragrant blooms during the spring and early summer. It is a sympodial orchid, meaning it grows in clusters with new growths arising from the base of the old pseudobulbs. Due to its rarity and beauty, it is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and collectors."
