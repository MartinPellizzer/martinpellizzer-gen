    "intro": "Caragana acanthophylla subsp. macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-flowered burr sage, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs, and its distinctive, spiny pods that contain seeds. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, contributing to its ornamental value. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soil conditions. This subspecies is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for wildlife."
