It belongs to the sedge family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, three-angled berries.
