    "intro": "Coelogyne bruneiensis, commonly known as the Bornean orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments within lowland forests. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are often orange or reddish in color, with a distinctive spurred lip. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, helping it store water in its native habitat. Coelogyne bruneiensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
