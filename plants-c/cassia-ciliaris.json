    "intro": "Cassia ciliaris, commonly known as golden crownbeard, is a flowering plant native to Africa, southern Asia, and parts of Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces bright yellow inflorescences that consist of clusters of small, pea-like flowers. Cassia ciliaris is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in arid to semi-arid environments. It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
