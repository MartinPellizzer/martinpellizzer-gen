    "intro": "Comolia ayangannae, commonly known as the Ayangannae ghost fern, is a rare and unique species native to the humid rainforests of West Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and has a complex root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the forest floor. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, relying on wind pollination for propagation. Due to habitat loss, Comolia ayangannae is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists studying rare plant adaptations."
