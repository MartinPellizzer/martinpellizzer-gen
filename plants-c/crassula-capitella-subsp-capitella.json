It features dense clusters of fleshy, rounded leaves that form a rosette shape, often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, star-shaped white flowers during the summer months, adding ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
