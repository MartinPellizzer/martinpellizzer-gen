    "intro": "Claytonia chenopodina, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Portulacaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its foliage is typically covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss. Claytonia chenopodina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in dry landscapes."
