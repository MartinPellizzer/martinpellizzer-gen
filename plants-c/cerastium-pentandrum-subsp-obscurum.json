    "intro": "Cerastium pentandrum subsp. obscurum, commonly known as the dark sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens."
