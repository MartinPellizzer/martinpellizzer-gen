    "intro": "Corymbia aureola, commonly known as the golden gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale to golden-brown bark that peels in thin, flaky strips. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a whitish underside. Corymbia aureola is typically found in dry, open forests and woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils."
