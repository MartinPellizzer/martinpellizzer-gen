    "intro": "Cathartocarpus bicapsularis, commonly known as the two-capsule grass, is a member of the Poaceae family. It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces two distinct types of spikelets, which are a key feature in its botanical description. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its morphology and growth habits make it an important species in ecological studies of grassland ecosystems."
