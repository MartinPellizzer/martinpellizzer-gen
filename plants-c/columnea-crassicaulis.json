    "intro": "Columnea crassicaulis, commonly known as the thick-stemmed flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds, which are attracted to its nectar-rich blooms. Columnea crassicaulis is often cultivated as a decorative plant for its ornamental value and unique foliage."
