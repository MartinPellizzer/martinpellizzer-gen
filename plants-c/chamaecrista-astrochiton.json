It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant produces bright yellow flowers arranged in dense, racemose inflorescences, which bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are trifoliate, with small, elliptical leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent soil erosion."
