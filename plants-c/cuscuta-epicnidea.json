    "intro": "Cuscuta epicnidea, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow-orange flowers and has thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to various regions in the Americas and is often found on crops like beans and sunflowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, making it a common weed in agricultural settings. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to the growth and yield of its host plants."
