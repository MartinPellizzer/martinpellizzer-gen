    "intro": "Chascolytrum juergensii var. angustilemma, commonly known as the narrow-lemma chascolytrum, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open grasslands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to thrive in harsh conditions. This species is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
