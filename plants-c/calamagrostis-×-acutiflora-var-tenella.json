    "intro": "Calamagrostis \u00d7 acutiflora var. tenella, commonly known as 'Little Oat' switchgrass, is a compact, ornamental grass native to the United States. It features narrow, silver-green blades that are shorter and more upright than the standard variety, making it ideal for small spaces. The plant produces fluffy, oat-like seed heads in late summer, adding visual interest to the landscape. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for native plant gardens and erosion control."
