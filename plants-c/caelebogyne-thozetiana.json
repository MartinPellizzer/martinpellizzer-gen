    "intro": "Caelebogyne thozetiana, commonly known as the Zambesi lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the freshwater ecosystems of southern Africa. It features broad, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with long, slender stems that support its showy, white to pink flowers. The plant thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in marshy habitats along rivers and lakes. Its flowers are typically borne in clusters and bloom during the wet season, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Caelebogyne thozetiana plays an important ecological role in its native environment by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
