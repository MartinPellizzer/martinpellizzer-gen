    "intro": "Cypripedium caudatum, commonly known as the tail orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive greenish-yellow lip and a tall, slender stem. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and rocky slopes. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy coating, which helps in water retention. Cypripedium caudatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
