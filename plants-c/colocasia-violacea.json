    "intro": "Colocasia violacea, commonly known as the violet arrowhead, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves that range in color from deep green to violet, often with a purplish hue. The plant thrives in shallow, still water and is often found in wetlands and marshes. Its leaves are broad and arrowhead-shaped, which gives it its common name. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months."
