    "intro": "Cynanchum anderssonii, commonly known as the Chinese milkweed, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
