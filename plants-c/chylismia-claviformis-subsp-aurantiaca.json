    "intro": "Chylismia claviformis subsp. aurantiaca, commonly known as the golden clubmoss, is a rare and distinctive plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems that bear small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically reddish-brown in color and contain numerous spores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
