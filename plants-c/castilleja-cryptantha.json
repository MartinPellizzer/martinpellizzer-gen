    "intro": "Castilleja cryptantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vivid red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures, relying on neighboring plants for water and nutrients. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Castilleja cryptantha plays an important role in pollination and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value."
