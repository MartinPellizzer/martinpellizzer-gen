    "intro": "Clematis puberula var. tenuisepala, commonly known as the slender-sepal clematis, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, pubescent stems and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets, and its sepals are notably thin and elongated, giving it its botanical name. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, moist soil. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
