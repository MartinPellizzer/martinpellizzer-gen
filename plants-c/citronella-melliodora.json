    "intro": "Citronella melliodora, commonly known as sweet citronella, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, lemon-scented leaves that are often used in aromatherapy and as a natural insect repellent. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by oval-shaped fruits containing aromatic seeds. Its essential oil, derived from the leaves, contains high levels of citral, which gives it its distinctive scent. Due to its medicinal and aromatic properties, Citronella melliodora is widely cultivated for both commercial and traditional uses."
