    "intro": "Crepidomanes rupicola, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in rocky, arid environments, often found on limestone or granite surfaces. The plant's structure is a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the mutualistic relationship between its fungal and algal components. It plays a crucial role in soil formation and nutrient cycling in harsh ecosystems. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator species for ecological health."
