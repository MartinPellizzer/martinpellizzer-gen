    "intro": "Crotalaria astragalinoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf cowpea, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pinnately compound leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by bean-like pods containing several seeds. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used as a green manure crop."
