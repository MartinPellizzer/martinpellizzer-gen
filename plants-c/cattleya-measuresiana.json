It is characterized by its vibrant, fragrant flowers that come in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid conditions. Cattleya measuresiana blooms once a year, producing large, showy inflorescences that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
