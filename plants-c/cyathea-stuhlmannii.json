    "intro": "Cyathea stuhlmannii, commonly known as the Stuhlmann's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, trunk-like stem covered with persistent, fibrous roots. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, contributing to its ornamental value. Cyathea stuhlmannii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens in suitable climates."
