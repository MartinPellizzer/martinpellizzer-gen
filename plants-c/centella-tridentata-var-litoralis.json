    "intro": "Centella tridentata var. litoralis, commonly known as sea centella, is a coastal plant adapted to saline and sandy environments. It features small, trifoliate leaves with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny white flowers and round, fleshy fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in tidal zones and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Its ability to thrive in harsh coastal conditions makes it an important species for stabilizing dune ecosystems."
