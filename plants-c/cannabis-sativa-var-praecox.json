    "intro": "Cannabis sativa var. praecox, commonly known as early hemp, is a variety of the cannabis plant that matures quickly, typically within 60 to 90 days. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and relatively low levels of THC compared to other cannabis varieties. This strain is often cultivated for industrial purposes such as fiber production and seed harvesting. The plant's leaves are broad and serrated, and it produces small, fluffy flowers that are typically not used for recreational or medicinal purposes. Its rapid growth cycle makes it suitable for regions with shorter growing seasons."
