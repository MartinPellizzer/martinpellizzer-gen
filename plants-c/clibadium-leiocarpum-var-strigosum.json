    "intro": "Clibadium leiocarpum var. strigosum, commonly known as the hairy sycamore, is a variant of the sycamore tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive hairy foliage and bark, which provide camouflage and protection against herbivores. The plant belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is known for its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. This variant is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
