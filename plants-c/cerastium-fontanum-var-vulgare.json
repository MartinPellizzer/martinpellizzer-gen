It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and the plant is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance. It is also known for its ability to spread through runners, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion."
