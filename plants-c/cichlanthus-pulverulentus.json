    "intro": "Cichlanthus pulverulentus, commonly known as the dusty cichlanthus, is a member of the Malvaceae family, characterized by its unique botanical features. It is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is known for its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a dusty appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often accompanied by bracts. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a rough texture due to the dense pubescence. Cichlanthus pulverulentus is adapted to dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
