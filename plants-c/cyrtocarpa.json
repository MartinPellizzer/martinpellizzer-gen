    "intro": "Cyrtocarpa, commonly known as the desert date or African date palm, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Anacardiaceae. It consists of several species, primarily native to Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. The plants are characterized by their palm-like appearance, with tall, slender trunks and large, pinnately compound leaves. Cyrtocarpa species produce small, yellowish flowers that are followed by fleshy, edible fruits. These plants are adapted to arid environments and are often found in dry savannas and coastal regions."
