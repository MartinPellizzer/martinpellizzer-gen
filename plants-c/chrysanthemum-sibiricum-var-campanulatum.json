It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange. The plant typically blooms in late summer to early autumn, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
