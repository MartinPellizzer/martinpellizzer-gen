    "intro": "Campyloneurum vulpinum, commonly known as the fox's tail fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its distinctive, fox-tail-like appearance due to its dense clusters of narrow, arching leaves. The plant thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often used as an ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes for its unique foliage. Campyloneurum vulpinum is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
