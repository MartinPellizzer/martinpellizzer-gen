It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water.

Its botanical features make it well-suited for xerophytic environments, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects."
