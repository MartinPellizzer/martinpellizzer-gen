    "intro": "Carex stricta var. curtissima, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clusters, typically reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. This variety is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along the shores of lakes and rivers."
