    "intro": "Centratherum camporum var. albicans, commonly known as the white-flowered grassvetch, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in grassy habitats, including meadows and disturbed soils. Its leaves are linear and often have a hairy texture, while its seeds are small and dry. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
