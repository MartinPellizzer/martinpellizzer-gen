    "intro": "Caltha palustris f. dentata, commonly known as the toothed marsh marigold, is a botanical variant of the marsh marigold. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, acidic environments such as bogs and wet meadows. The plant features bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are broadly ovate with serrated edges, distinguishing it from the typical form. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for early pollinators and supporting wetland biodiversity."
