    "intro": "Claytonia cordifolia, commonly known as heartleaf andromeda, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its foliage is covered in a fine, white coating called farina, which helps reduce water loss. Claytonia cordifolia is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive appearance."
