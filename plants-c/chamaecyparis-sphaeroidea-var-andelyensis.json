    "intro": "Chamaecyparis sphaeroidea var. andelyensis, commonly known as the Andelyensis cedar, is a rare and ornamental conifer native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its compact, spherical shape and scale-like leaves that give it a unique, almost geometric appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous cones and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. It is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a valuable species for botanical collections and conservation efforts."
