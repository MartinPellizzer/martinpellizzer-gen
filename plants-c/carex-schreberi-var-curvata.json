    "intro": "Carex schreberi var. curvata, commonly known as the curly sedges, is a perennial sedge native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, bogs, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, cylindrical spikes of tiny flowers in the summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
