    "intro": "Cufodontia arborea, commonly known as the tree fern of the ancient rainforests, is a unique species characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is native to tropical regions with high humidity and warm climates. The plant exhibits a distinctive growth pattern, with a central trunk covered in a layer of old fronds that eventually fall off. Its reproductive structures are hidden within the fronds, and it relies on spore dispersal for propagation. Due to habitat loss, Cufodontia arborea is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural range."
