    "intro": "Conilaria, commonly known as the \"false holly,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Scrophulariaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. The plants are characterized by their opposite, simple, and often lance-shaped leaves. Their flowers are typically showy, with two-lipped petals that are usually pink, purple, or white. Conilaria species are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
