    "intro": "Cienfuegosia sulfurea var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth cienfuegosia, is a shrub native to specific regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves, which are typically lance-shaped and have a glossy surface. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
