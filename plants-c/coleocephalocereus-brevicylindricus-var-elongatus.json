    "intro": "Coleocephalocereus brevicylindricus var. elongatus, commonly known as the elongated pincushion cactus, is a unique cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in the wild."
