    "intro": "Cereus tehuacanus, commonly known as the Mexican candleplant, is a cacti species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, a trait common among many cacti species. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil. Its structure and growth pattern make it well adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions."
