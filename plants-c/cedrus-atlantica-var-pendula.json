    "intro": "Cedrus atlantica var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping cedar of Lebanon, is a striking coniferous tree characterized by its pendulous branches that cascade downward, creating a unique, ornamental appearance. It is native to the eastern Mediterranean region, specifically the mountains of Lebanon and Turkey. This variety of cedar has scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath, providing a dense, foliage-rich canopy. The tree produces small, yellowish cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds. It is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value and can thrive in well-drained soils with full sun exposure."
