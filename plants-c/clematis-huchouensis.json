    "intro": "Clematis huchouensis, commonly known as the Huchou Clematis, is a deciduous vine native to China. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are typically white or pale blue with a distinctive, fragrant aroma. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are edible but not widely cultivated for consumption. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its attractive foliage and showy blooms that appear in late spring to early summer."
