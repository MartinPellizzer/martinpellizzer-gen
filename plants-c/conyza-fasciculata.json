    "intro": "Conyza fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered horseweed, is a flowering plant native to Africa, Australia, and parts of Asia. It is an annual herb that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster, which are characteristic of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Conyza fasciculata is also known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it a potential weed in certain regions."
