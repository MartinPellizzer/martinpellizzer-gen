    "intro": "Caladenia woolcockiorum, commonly known as the Woolcock's Spider-orchid, is a striking orchid native to Western Australia. It features a slender, hairy stem with a single, showy flower that has a distinctive spider-like appearance. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing a pale pink or cream-colored flower with a dark red or purple lip. It grows in sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as heathlands and woodlands. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
