    "intro": "Cyphomandra hypomalaca, commonly known as the long-fruited tomato or the purple tomato, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its hairy stems and large, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces small, round to oval fruits that are typically purple when mature, though they can also be red or yellow. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a potential edible crop, though its fruit is less commonly consumed than other tomato species. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
