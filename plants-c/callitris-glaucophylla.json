    "intro": "Callitris glaucophylla, commonly known as the coastal white cypress, is a small to medium-sized evergreen conifer native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically a pale blue-green color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and dunes. Callitris glaucophylla is adapted to tolerate salt spray and is an important component of the local flora in its habitat."
