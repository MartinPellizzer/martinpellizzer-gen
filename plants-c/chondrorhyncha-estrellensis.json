    "intro": "Chondrorhyncha estrellensis, commonly known as the Estrellan rock orchid, is a rare and unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of Estrelle. It is a perennial herb with a compact, cushion-like growth habit, adapted to thrive in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, with a subtle fragrance. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, helping it conserve water in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
