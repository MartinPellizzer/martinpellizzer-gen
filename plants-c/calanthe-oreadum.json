    "intro": "Calanthe oreadum, commonly known as the mountain calanthe, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rhizomatous growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows at elevations between 1,000 and 3,000 meters, thriving in cool, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, and the flowers are borne on short, erect stems. Calanthe oreadum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
