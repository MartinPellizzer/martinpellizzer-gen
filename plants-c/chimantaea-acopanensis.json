    "intro": "Chimantaea acopanensis, commonly known as the Acop\u00e1n chimantea, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid climates. Its flowers are usually small and yellow, arranged in dense clusters, and bloom during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chimantaea acopanensis is considered a vulnerable species."
