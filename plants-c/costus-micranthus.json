    "intro": "Costus micranthus, commonly known as the small-flowered costus, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Costaceae and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in dense spikes at the top of the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical climates."
