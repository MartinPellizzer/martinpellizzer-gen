    "intro": "Cirsium lanceolatum var. rhiphaeum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The plant features spiny, lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and its purple to violet flowers are arranged in a spherical cluster. It produces small, dry fruits called achenes, which are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
