    "intro": "Clematis viticella var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the slenderleaf Clematis, is a compact, deciduous vine native to Europe. It features small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of white and pale blue. The leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This variety is prized for its hardiness and ability to climb trellises or fences with minimal support."
