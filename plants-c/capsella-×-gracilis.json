It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in temperate regions across Europe and parts of Asia. Its botanical features include alternate leaves with lobed margins and a rapid growth cycle, making it a common weed in agricultural settings."
