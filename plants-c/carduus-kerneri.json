    "intro": "Carduus kerneri, commonly known as the Kern's thistle, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant has deeply lobed, silvery-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native habitats."
