    "intro": "Cystopus crispus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky, silver-blue foliage and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in saline environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions. Its leaves are typically crinkled or wavy, giving it a textured appearance, while its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cystopus crispus is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
