    "intro": "Carex biligularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a tight, cylindrical cluster. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, which are usually borne on slender, unbranched stems. Carex biligularis is often found in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
