    "intro": "Carex echinata var. leersii, commonly known as the rough sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
