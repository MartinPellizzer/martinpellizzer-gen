    "intro": "Conanthodium, commonly known as the mountain cranesbill, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. It consists of several species native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. The plants are characterized by their hairy stems and showy, often blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring. Conanthodium species typically grow in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
