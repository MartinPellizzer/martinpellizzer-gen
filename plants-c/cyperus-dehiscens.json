    "intro": "Cyperus dehiscens, commonly known as the spreading flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it a common weed in aquatic and semi-aquatic environments. Cyperus dehiscens is adapted to fluctuating water levels and can thrive in both submerged and emergent habitats."
