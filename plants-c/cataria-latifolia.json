    "intro": "Cataria latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf cataria, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots make it suitable for soil stabilization in erosion-prone areas. Cataria latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in herbal medicine."
