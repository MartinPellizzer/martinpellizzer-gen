It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in cyathia. Its stems are often covered in thorn-like structures, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruits, which are used in local cuisines."
