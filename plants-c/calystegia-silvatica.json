It features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow to white. The plant has a robust root system and can spread aggressively, making it a persistent weed in woodland and disturbed areas. Its stems are covered in fine hairs and can twine around other plants or structures. Calystegia silvatica is often found in moist, shaded environments and is known for its ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions."
