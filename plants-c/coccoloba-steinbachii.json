    "intro": "Coccoloba steinbachii, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a flowering plant species native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a small shrub that typically grows in coastal areas, often in brackish or saltwater environments. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are usually red or purple in color, which help it absorb more sunlight in its often-shaded habitat. Its flowers are small and yellow, and it produces edible berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. The plant plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing erosion."
