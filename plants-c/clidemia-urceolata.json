    "intro": "Clidemia urceolata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false mallow, is a tropical flowering plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a waxy texture, while its stems are often covered in fine hairs. Clidemia urceolata is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
