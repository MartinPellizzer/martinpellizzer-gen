    "intro": "Cenchrus lapeta, commonly known as the desert grass or narrowleaf sandgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive drought conditions. Cenchrus lapeta plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
