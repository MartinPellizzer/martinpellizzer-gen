It contains over 100 chemical compounds known as cannabinoids, with tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) being the most well-known. The plant's leaves are typically broad and serrated, while its flowers, or buds, are the primary source of cannabinoids. Cannabis is cultivated for its psychoactive effects, medicinal properties, and industrial uses. Its growth habits vary depending on the strain, with some varieties being annuals and others perennials."
