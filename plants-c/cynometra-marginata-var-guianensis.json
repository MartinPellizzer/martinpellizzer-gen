    "intro": "Cynometra marginata var. guianensis, commonly known as the Guianan ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark brown to black bark, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its hard wood, it is widely used in construction and furniture-making, though it is also threatened by deforestation."
