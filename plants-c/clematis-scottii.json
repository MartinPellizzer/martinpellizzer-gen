    "intro": "Clematis scottii, commonly known as the Scottish clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the mountainous regions of Scotland. It features palmate leaves with three to five lobes and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of blue to purple. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are woody and twining, allowing it to climb and spread along supports. Clematis scottii prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates."
