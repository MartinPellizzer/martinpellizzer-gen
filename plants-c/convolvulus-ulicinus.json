    "intro": "Convolvulus ulicinus, commonly known as the field bindweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale pink to purple in color. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often becoming invasive. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it a challenging weed to control."
