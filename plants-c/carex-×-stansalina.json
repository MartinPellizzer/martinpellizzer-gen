    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 stansalina, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Carex stricta and Carex acutata, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant forms dense clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. It thrives in wet to moist environments, such as marshes and pond edges, and is often found in temperate regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in wetland habitats."
