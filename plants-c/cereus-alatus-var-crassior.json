    "intro": "Cereus alatus var. crassior, commonly known as the thick-stemmed cactus, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the night, a common trait among many cacti. It has sharp, spiny areoles that can bear both flowers and later, small, red fruits. This variety is often cultivated for its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
