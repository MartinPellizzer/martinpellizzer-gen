    "intro": "Cerastium ligusticum subsp. granulatum, commonly known as the granular mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe. It features small, basal leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers with four petals, which bloom in early spring. Its flowering stems are usually prostrate or ascending, often rooting at the nodes to form dense mats. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny environments."
