    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 volcameriana, commonly known as the kumquat, is a hybrid citrus plant that originated from the cross between the pomelo (Citrus maxima) and the mandarin (Citrus reticulata). It is a small evergreen tree that produces small, oval-shaped fruits with a thin, edible peel. The fruit's outer skin is typically orange in color and contains a high concentration of essential oils, contributing to its aromatic qualities. The fruit is typically harvested when it turns a deep orange, and it is often consumed whole, including the peel. Citrus \u00d7 volcameriana is well-suited to subtropical climates and is valued for its ornamental appeal as well as its culinary uses."
