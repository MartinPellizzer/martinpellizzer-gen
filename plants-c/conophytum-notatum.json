    "intro": "Conophytum notatum, commonly known as the \"Cape Karoo stone plant,\" is a succulent native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, stone-like leaves that store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Conophytum notatum is often used in rock gardens and is valued for its unique appearance and resilience."
