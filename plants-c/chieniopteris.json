    "intro": "Chieniopteris, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a genus of aquatic ferns native to East Asia. It typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it thrives in shallow, still waters. The plant features delicate, feathery fronds that are often submerged or partially submerged, contributing to its aesthetic appeal in aquatic settings. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption. Chieniopteris is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in maintaining water quality in natural and artificial aquatic habitats."
