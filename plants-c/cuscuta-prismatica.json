    "intro": "Cuscuta prismatica, commonly known as the prickly dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellow flowers and has a distinctive, branched stem covered in tiny, hooked spines. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on grasses, shrubs, and other flowering plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, allowing it to spread across various habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and native vegetation."
