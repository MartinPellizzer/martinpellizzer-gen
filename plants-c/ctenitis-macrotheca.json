    "intro": "Ctenitis macrotheca, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a robust, unbranched trunk that is covered in a thick layer of sori, which are the spore-producing structures. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Ctenitis macrotheca plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various organisms."
