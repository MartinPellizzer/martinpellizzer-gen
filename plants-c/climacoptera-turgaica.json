    "intro": "Climacoptera turgaica, commonly known as the mountain flame, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Turgaic Mountains. It is characterized by its striking red and orange inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant has a woody stem with a dense, fibrous bark that helps it withstand harsh mountain conditions. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to minimize water loss in arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Climacoptera turgaica is considered a vulnerable species."
