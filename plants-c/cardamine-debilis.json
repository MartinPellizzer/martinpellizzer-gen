    "intro": "Cardamine debilis, commonly known as slender water shield, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often near the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has delicate, floating leaves that are broadly ovate with a waxy surface, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. The species is relatively rare and can be sensitive to environmental changes, making it an indicator of water quality."
