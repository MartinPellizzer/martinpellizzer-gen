The plant has a robust, straight trunk and can reach heights of up to 20 meters, making it a prominent feature in the canopy of rainforests. It plays a vital role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Its rapid growth rate and ability to thrive in disturbed areas make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
