    "intro": "Chrysopogon sinensis, commonly known as Chinese grass or sweetgrass, is a perennial grass native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to golden florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and traditional uses, it is cultivated in some regions for horticultural and cultural purposes."
