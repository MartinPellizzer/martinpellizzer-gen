    "intro": "Cymbopogon cambogiensis, commonly known as lemon grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, aromatic stalks that emit a strong lemony scent due to the presence of citral. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its rhizomes and lower stems are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. Cymbopogon cambogiensis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its essential oils."
