    "intro": "Cusparia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their striking, spiny leaves and vibrant, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands, Cusparia species are adapted to saline and well-drained soils. The plant's unique morphology includes bracts that resemble spines, which help protect it from herbivores and reduce water loss. Cusparia is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
