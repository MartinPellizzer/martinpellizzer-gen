    "intro": "Cucurbita maxima var. farinae, commonly known as the marsh mallow gourd, is a cultivar of the species Cucurbita maxima. It is characterized by its large, elongated, pale green to yellowish fruits with a rough, warty surface. The plant is typically grown for its ornamental value rather than for food, due to the bitter taste of its fruits. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, requiring a long growing season. The gourd is part of the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other squash and pumpkin varieties."
