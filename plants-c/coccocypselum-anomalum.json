It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Coccocypselum anomalum is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its rapid growth rate. It is also considered an invasive species in some areas due to its competitive nature."
