    "intro": "Calathea tuberosa, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that often display patterns of green, silver, and pink. The plant's scientific name, Calathea tuberosa, refers to its tuberous roots, which store nutrients and water. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. The leaves of Calathea tuberosa are known to fold shut at night, a behavior that gives it its common name."
