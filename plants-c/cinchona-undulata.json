    "intro": "Cinchona undulata, commonly known as the wavy bark cinchona, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its ornamental, wavy-patterned bark and its preference for humid, shaded environments. It produces small, white to pinkish flowers and red berries, which are typical of the genus Cinchona. This species is also valued for its potential medicinal properties, though it is less commonly used than other cinchona species for quinine production."
