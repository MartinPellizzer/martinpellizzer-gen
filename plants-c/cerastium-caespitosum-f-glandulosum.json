    "intro": "Cerastium caespitosum f. glandulosum, commonly known as the sticky mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving the plant its \"glandulosum\" designation. The flowers are white, five-petaled, and appear in clusters during late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rock gardens. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to spread easily through stolons."
