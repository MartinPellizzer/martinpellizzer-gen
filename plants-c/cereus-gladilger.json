    "intro": "Cereus gladilger, commonly known as the Gladilger cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, green stem and sparse, spiny foliage. The plant produces large, nocturnal flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming during the summer months. Its stems are often branched and can grow quite tall, making it a striking addition to arid landscapes. Cereus gladilger is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water once established."
