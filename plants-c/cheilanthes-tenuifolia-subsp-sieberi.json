    "intro": "Cheilanthes tenuifolia subsp. sieberi, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in rocky or crevice habitats, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Its leaves are usually pale green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in dry environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
