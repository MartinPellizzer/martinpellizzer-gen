    "intro": "Campanumoea labordei, commonly known as the laborde's bellflower, is a rare and striking member of the Campanulaceae family. Native to the mountainous regions of Ecuador, it is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, thriving in the undergrowth of cloud forests. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Campanumoea labordei is considered a species of conservation concern."
