    "intro": "Cephalomanes rhomboideum, commonly known as the rhomboid sea hare, is a species of sea slug belonging to the family Onchidiidae. It is characterized by its elongated, soft body and a distinctive rhomboid-shaped head. This marine gastropod is typically found in tropical and subtropical coastal areas, where it inhabits sandy or muddy substrates. Its body is covered in a thin, translucent layer that allows for some light penetration, aiding in photosynthesis when it feeds on algae. The plant-like appearance of Cephalomanes rhomboideum is due to its ability to absorb nutrients from the environment, making it a unique example of a marine invertebrate with botanical-like traits."
