    "intro": "Callitriche umbonata, commonly known as the broadleaf water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, such as ponds and ditches. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are arranged in two rows along the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, often floating at the water's surface. Callitriche umbonata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish."
