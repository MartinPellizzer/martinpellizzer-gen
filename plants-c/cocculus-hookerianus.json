    "intro": "Cocculus hookerianus, commonly known as the hooked cocculus, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive, hooked seed pods. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, twisted fruits. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, bumpy pod that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind or animal contact. The plant is often found in moist, shaded areas and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
