    "intro": "Ctenopteris truncorum, commonly known as the broad-leafed sea\u84b2, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Pacific Ocean. It is characterized by its large, leathery, fan-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are typically divided into a series of segments with a distinctive notched or truncated appearance at the tips. It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in shaded, moist areas. The plant's unique morphology and adaptability to coastal conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
