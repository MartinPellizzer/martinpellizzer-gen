    "intro": "Cerastium nervosum var. glareosum, commonly known as the silver-leaved mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its stems are prostrate, often rooting at the nodes, which helps it spread vegetatively. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
