    "intro": "Cissus aconitifolia, commonly known as the Indian Snowball or the Silver Cissus, is a climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, which resemble snowballs. Its stems are succulent and can root at the nodes, allowing it to climb and spread easily. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
