    "intro": "Ceanothus integerrimus var. parvifolius, commonly known as the coastal ceanothus, is a shrub native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy bloom, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive floral display."
