    "intro": "Coffea semsei, commonly known as the Sibi or Sibi coffee, is a rare and ancient species of coffee native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped red berries that contain a single seed, which is used for coffee production. The plant is typically found in shaded, humid environments at elevations above 1,500 meters. It has dark green, glossy leaves and produces small white flowers. Due to its limited distribution and low yield, it is considered a unique and less commercially significant coffee variety."
