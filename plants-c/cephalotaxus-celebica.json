    "intro": "Cephalotaxus celebica, commonly known as the Celebes yew, is a rare and endangered evergreen conifer native to the tropical rainforests of Indonesia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and dense, scale-like leaves that are dark green in color. The plant produces small, reddish-yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. It belongs to the family Taxaceae, which includes other yew species, and is notable for its unique morphology and ecological significance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically important for conservation efforts."
