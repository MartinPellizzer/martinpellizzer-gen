    "intro": "Cocculus ovalifolius, commonly known as the oval-leaved devil's backbone, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, twisting stem and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by spiny, spherical fruits. Its seeds are enclosed within these spiny fruits, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject in botanical studies."
