    "intro": "Calceolaria lagunae-blancae, commonly known as the white-lake calceolaria, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean highlands of Bolivia. It is characterized by its distinctive calyx-shaped flowers, which resemble small pouches, a feature typical of the Calceolaria genus. The plant produces vibrant orange or yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a cool, temperate climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
