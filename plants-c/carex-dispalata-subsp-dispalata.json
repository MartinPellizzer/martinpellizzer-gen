    "intro": "Carex dispalata subsp. dispalata, commonly known as the common sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences, which contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
