    "intro": "[WRONG START] Codia bridgesii, commonly known as the Natal mahogany, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in coastal and riverine forests. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
