    "intro": "Calliandra dolichopoda, commonly known as the longpod calliandra, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, pod-like fruits. The plant produces clusters of bright red or orange flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feathery leaflets, and it has a woody stem that can grow into a shrub or small tree. Calliandra dolichopoda is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and is also used in some traditional medicinal practices."
