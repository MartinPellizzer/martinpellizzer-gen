    "intro": "Cyclosorus contractus, commonly known as the narrowleaf water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. The plant has slender, branching stems that produce small, rounded leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. Its flowers are inconspicuous, consisting of a single whorl of three sepals and three stamens. Cyclosorus contractus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
