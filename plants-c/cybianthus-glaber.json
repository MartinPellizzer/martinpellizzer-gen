    "intro": "Cybianthus glaber, commonly known as the naked stem cybianthus, is a member of the Asteraceae family. It is native to the western United States, particularly California, and thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. It typically grows in open areas such as chaparral and sagebrush communities. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
