    "intro": "Cerradicola nana, commonly known as the dwarf cerradicola, is a small flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
