It is characterized by its thorny branches, elliptical leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of white to pink flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus strigosa is often found in woodlands, thickets, and along streambanks, thriving in well-drained soils."
