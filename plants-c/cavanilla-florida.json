    "intro": "Cavanilla florida, commonly known as the Florida cavanilla, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist, sandy soils. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, often covered in fine hairs. Cavanilla florida plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies, due to its nectar-rich blooms."
