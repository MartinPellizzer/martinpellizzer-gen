    "intro": "Cyathea costalisora, commonly known as the coastal tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found near coastal areas and in dense forests. Its rhizome system supports the growth of the trunk and anchors the plant in moist, well-drained soil. Cyathea costalisora plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
