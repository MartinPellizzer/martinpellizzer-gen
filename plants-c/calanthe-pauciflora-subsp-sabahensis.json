    "intro": "Calanthe pauciflora subsp. sabahensis, commonly known as the Sabah calanthe, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the highland regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with a pseudobulb that supports its foliage and flowers. The plant produces small, lance-shaped leaves and bears clusters of pale green to white flowers with prominent yellow sepals and petals. It thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, typically in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable and vulnerable species in botanical conservation efforts."
