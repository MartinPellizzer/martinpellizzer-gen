    "intro": "Carex polyandra, commonly known as the broad-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with three-ranked leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically flowering in late spring to early summer. Carex polyandra thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its dense growth habit makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and habitat creation for various wildlife species."
