    "intro": "Cardamine agyokumontana, commonly known as the Himalayan watercress, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often along streams and in mountainous terrain. Its leaves are small and fern-like, and it produces tiny white or yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery taste similar to watercress."
