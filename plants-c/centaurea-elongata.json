    "intro": "Centaurea elongata, commonly known as the slender cornflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats. Centaurea elongata is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators."
