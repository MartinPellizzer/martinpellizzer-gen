    "intro": "Cylindrolobus linearifolius, commonly known as the slender-leafed cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and long, narrow, pinnately compound leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in well-drained soils. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
