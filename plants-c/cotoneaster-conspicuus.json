    "intro": "Cotoneaster conspicuus, commonly known as the showy cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features small, glossy leaves that turn reddish in the fall, adding visual interest to the landscape. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that persist into winter. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adaptable to a variety of soil types. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often used in gardens and as a landscape plant."
