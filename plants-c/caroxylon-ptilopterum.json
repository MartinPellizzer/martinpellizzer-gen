    "intro": "Caroxylon ptilopterum, commonly known as the feather-leaf cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
