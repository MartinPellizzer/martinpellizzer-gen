It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and distinctive pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It is often used as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing ability and drought tolerance. Its botanical features make it adaptable to various soil types and climates."
