    "intro": "Coelogyne tomentosa var. penangensis, commonly known as the Penang hairy orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte on trees in humid, tropical rainforests. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also considered endangered in its natural range."
