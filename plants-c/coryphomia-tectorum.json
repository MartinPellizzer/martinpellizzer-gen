    "intro": "Coryphomia tectorum, commonly known as the roof spider, is a species of orb-weaving spider found in various regions. It is characterized by its small to medium size and its ability to construct intricate, circular webs. The plant-like appearance of its web, with its radial and spiral threads, is a notable botanical feature. While not a plant, its web structure is often studied for its engineering properties. The spider's habitat and web-building behavior make it an interesting subject in ecological and botanical research."
