    "intro": "Carex scopulus subsp. scopulus, commonly known as the rock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in harsh conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky habitats."
