    "intro": "Cotoneaster creticus, commonly known as the Cretan cotoneaster, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries in late summer. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions."
