    "intro": "Cystopus philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine water shield, is a species of aquatic plant native to the freshwater ecosystems of the Philippines. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, and it produces tiny, floating fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Cystopus philippinensis thrives in still or slow-moving waters, often growing in dense mats on the water's surface. It plays an important role in providing habitat for aquatic organisms and stabilizing water bodies."
