    "intro": "Cymbidium illiberale, commonly known as the Bornean orchid, is a species native to the island of Borneo. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its long, strap-like leaves and clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. It is a terrestrial orchid, meaning it grows from the ground rather than on trees, and is known for its ornamental value in horticulture. Cymbidium illiberale is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists and orchid enthusiasts due to its unique floral structure and ecological niche."
