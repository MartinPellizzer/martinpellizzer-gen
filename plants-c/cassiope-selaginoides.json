    "intro": "Cassiope selaginoides, commonly known as the rock heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Pacific Northwest. It features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white to grayish hairs. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Cassiope selaginoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky habitats."
