    "intro": "Cotonea, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Cotonea is native to the Americas but has been introduced to other tropical regions. It is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
