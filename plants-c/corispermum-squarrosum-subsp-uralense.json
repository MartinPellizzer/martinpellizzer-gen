    "intro": "Corispermum squarrosum subsp. uralense, commonly known as the Ural sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the steppes and arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered in fine, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color, followed by triangular, beak-like fruits. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, nutrient-poor environments. Its morphology reflects its evolutionary adaptations to survive in harsh, semi-arid climates."
