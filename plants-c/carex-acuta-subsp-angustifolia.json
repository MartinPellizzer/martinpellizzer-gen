    "intro": "Carex acuta subsp. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf bulblet sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability."
