    "intro": "Cassia mexicana var. moustiquensis, commonly known as the Mexican cassia or the moustiquensis cassia, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of Mexico. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant has a woody stem with a rough, bark-like texture. Cassia mexicana var. moustiquensis is often used in traditional medicine and can thrive in well-drained soils with full sun exposure."
