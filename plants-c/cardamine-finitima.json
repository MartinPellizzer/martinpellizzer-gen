    "intro": "Cardamine finitima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water crowfoot, is a delicate perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream sides and forest floors, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. The plant features trifoliate leaves with slender, serrated edges, and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread slowly through vegetative growth, forming dense clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of high-quality, undisturbed ecosystems."
