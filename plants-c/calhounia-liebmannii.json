    "intro": "Calhounia liebmannii, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red, pink, or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss. Calhounia liebmannii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
