    "intro": "Colchicum autumnale var. gibraltaricum, commonly known as the Gibraltar autumn crocus, is a rare and striking member of the Colchicaceae family. It is native to the Iberian Peninsula and parts of North Africa, including Gibraltar, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces striking purple to violet flowers with a distinctive red or orange corona, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
