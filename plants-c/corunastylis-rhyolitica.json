    "intro": "Corunastylis rhyolitica, commonly known as the rhyolite starflower, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific volcanic regions. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its star-shaped, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils, often found in areas with volcanic rock formations. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
