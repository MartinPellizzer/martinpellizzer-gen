    "intro": "Cardamine kokaiensis, commonly known as the Kokai mountain buttercup, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often colorful flowers and simple, palmately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces tiny, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cardamine kokaiensis is considered a vulnerable species."
