    "intro": "Chlorophytum zambiense, commonly known as the Zambian spider plant, is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring long, narrow leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by delicate, grass-like seed capsules. It is well adapted to bright, indirect light and is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular houseplant. Its ability to propagate through offsets and its air-purifying qualities further enhance its appeal in both indoor and outdoor settings."
