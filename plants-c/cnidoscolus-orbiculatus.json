    "intro": "Cnidoscolus orbiculatus, commonly known as the round-leaf stinging leaf or arrowhead plant, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stinging hairs, which can cause irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by edible, round, yellow fruits that are often consumed raw or cooked. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid, tropical environments. Due to its stinging properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
