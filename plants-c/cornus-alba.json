It is characterized by its striking red stems that become more vibrant in the winter months. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. Its leaves are broad and oval, with a smooth texture and a slightly wavy margin. Cornus alba is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
