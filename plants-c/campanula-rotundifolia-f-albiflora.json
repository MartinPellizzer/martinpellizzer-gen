    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia f. albiflora, commonly known as the white bellflower, is a flowering plant belonging to the Campanulaceae family. It is characterized by its rounded, lobed leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue. This perennial herb is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant's flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, oval berries that contain the seeds. Its botanical features make it a notable species in both horticulture and ecological studies."
