    "intro": "Cyperus dubius var. caespitosus, commonly known as the tufted flatsedge, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flower heads. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, forming dense colonies. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
