    "intro": "Carex pisiformis var. aureobrunnea, commonly known as the golden brown sedge, is a perennial plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that range from bright green to golden yellow, especially in the variegated form. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of brownish flowers in late summer, which are followed by dark, edible berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in shaded, wet environments."
