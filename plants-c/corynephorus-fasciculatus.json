    "intro": "Corynephorus fasciculatus, commonly known as the tufted grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening and for erosion control."
