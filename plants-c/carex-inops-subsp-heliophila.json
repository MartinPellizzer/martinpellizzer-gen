    "intro": "Carex inops subsp. heliophila, commonly known as the sun-loving sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Europe. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. This subspecies prefers full sun to partial shade and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. The plant is often found in wetlands, ditches, and other moist habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
