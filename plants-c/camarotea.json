    "intro": "Camarotea, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or floating in water. Camarotea species typically thrive in moist environments such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plants have rhizomes that help anchor them in the substrate and absorb nutrients. Their reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal."
