    "intro": "Chenopodium rubrum var. nanum, commonly known as dwarf lamb's quarters, is a low-growing annual plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and nutritional value, it is sometimes cultivated as a leaf vegetable or used in traditional medicine."
