It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets, which are arranged in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Cyperus tuberifer is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and disturbed soils. Its tuberous roots make it a hardy species capable of surviving in a variety of moist environments."
