    "intro": "Cogswellia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly covering that covers its stems, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant typically grows in a rounded or clump-like form, with short, thick stems that store water. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing in late spring or early summer. Cogswellia tomentosa is a slow-growing plant that requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive."
