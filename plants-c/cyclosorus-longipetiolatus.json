    "intro": "Cyclosorus longipetiolatus, commonly known as the long-petioled water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it to substrates while absorbing nutrients. The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family."
