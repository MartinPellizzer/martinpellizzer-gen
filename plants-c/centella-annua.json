    "intro": "Centella annua, commonly known as Asiatic pennywort, is a creeping perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has small, round, fleshy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily and form dense mats. The leaves are typically harvested for their medicinal properties, which include anti-inflammatory and wound-healing benefits."
