It is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark and its clusters of small, white flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus lepida typically grows in moist to wet soils in woodlands and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
