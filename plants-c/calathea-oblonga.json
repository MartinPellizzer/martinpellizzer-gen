It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are often adorned with intricate patterns and contrasting colors. The plant thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its foliage changes color in response to light exposure, a phenomenon known as nyctinasty. Calathea oblonga requires well-draining soil and consistent moisture to flourish."
