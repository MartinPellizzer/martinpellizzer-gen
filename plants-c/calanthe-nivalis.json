    "intro": "Calanthe nivalis, commonly known as the snow calanthe, is a rare and elegant orchid native to the high altitudes of Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rhizome and its striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires partial shade to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
