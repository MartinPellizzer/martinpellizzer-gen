    "intro": "Coelidium amphithaleoides, commonly known as the two-leaved bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its simple, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. It has small, opposite leaves and produces small, white or pink flowers. Due to its specialized adaptations for aquatic environments, it plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for microorganisms."
