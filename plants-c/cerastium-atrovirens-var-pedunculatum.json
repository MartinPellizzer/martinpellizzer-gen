    "intro": "Cerastium atrovirens var. pedunculatum, commonly known as the purple sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, often purple-tinged flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has slender stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, and its leaves are alternate, linear, and often covered with a waxy coating. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its elongated peduncles, which support its clusters of flowers."
