    "intro": "Carex fecunda var. fecunda, commonly known as the common sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. Carex fecunda var. fecunda plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
