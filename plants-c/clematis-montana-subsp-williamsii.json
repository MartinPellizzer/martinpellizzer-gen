It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers that are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and hardiness."
