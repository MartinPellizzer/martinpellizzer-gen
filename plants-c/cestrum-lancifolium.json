    "intro": "Cestrum lancifolium, commonly known as the lancifolium nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to attract nocturnal pollinators. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
