    "intro": "Cactus subinermis, commonly known as the narrowleaf cholla, is a spineless cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered with small, pale green to blue-gray spines. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sun exposure. Cactus subinermis is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
