It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically has trifoliate leaves and produces pods that contain several seeds. Calicotome species are often found in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to arid environments. They are sometimes used in traditional medicine and for soil stabilization in degraded landscapes."
