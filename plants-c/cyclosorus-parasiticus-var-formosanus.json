    "intro": "Cyclosorus parasiticus var. formosanus, commonly known as the Formosan parasitic liverwort, is a rare and specialized plant belonging to the family Marchaliaceae. It is a hemiparasitic liverwort, meaning it partially depends on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing some photosynthesis. This species typically grows on the roots of other plants, particularly in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its morphology includes a small, flattened thallus with a distinct, lobed structure. The plant's reproductive structures are embedded within the thallus, and it relies on specific host species for survival, making it an ecologically unique and sensitive indicator of habitat quality."
