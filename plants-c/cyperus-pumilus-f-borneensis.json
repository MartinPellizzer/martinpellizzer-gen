    "intro": "Cyperus pumilus f. borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean flat sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically thrives in wetland or marshy environments, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions make it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects. The varietal form 'borneensis' distinguishes it from other Cyperus species by its specific geographic distribution and morphological traits."
