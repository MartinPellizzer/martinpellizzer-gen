    "intro": "Codonanthe erubescens, commonly known as the red-flowered codonanthe, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular red or orange flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often found in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their bright coloration and nectar-rich structure."
