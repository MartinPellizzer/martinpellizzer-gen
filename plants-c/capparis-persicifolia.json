    "intro": "Capparis persicifolia, commonly known as Persian candytuft, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers. The plant has woody stems and pinnately compound leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically followed by small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Capparis persicifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens due to its attractive blooms and compact size."
