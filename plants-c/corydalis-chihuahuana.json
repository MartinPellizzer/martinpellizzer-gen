It is a member of the Fumariaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its survival in harsh conditions. Corydalis chihuahuana is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along dry streambeds."
