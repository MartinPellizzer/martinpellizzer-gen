    "intro": "Ctenitis sphaeropteroides, commonly known as the globe-topped tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, swollen trunk that resembles a globe, covered in a dense layer of fibrous roots. The plant has feather-like fronds that grow in a tight spiral pattern, giving it a unique and elegant appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forests. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
