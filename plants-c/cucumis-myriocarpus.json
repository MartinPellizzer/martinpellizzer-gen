    "intro": "Cucumis myriocarpus, commonly known as the many-seeded gourd, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other cucurbits like cucumbers and melons. The plant produces small, pale green fruits that are typically harvested when immature. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. The fruit's unique, angular shape and numerous seeds make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
