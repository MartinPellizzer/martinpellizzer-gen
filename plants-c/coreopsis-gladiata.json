    "intro": "Coreopsis gladiata, commonly known as the swordleaf coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces bright yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance ornamental plants. Coreopsis gladiata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
