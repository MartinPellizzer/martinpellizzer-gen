    "intro": "Curtogyne undata, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, with five petals and a distinct spur. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Curtogyne undata thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
