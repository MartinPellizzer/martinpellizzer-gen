    "intro": "Campium wallii, commonly known as the Chinese cliff brake, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, often on cliffs or in forested areas. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to anchor itself in crevices. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it recognizable in its natural habitat."
