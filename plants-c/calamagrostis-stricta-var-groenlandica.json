    "intro": "Calamagrostis stricta var. groenlandica, commonly known as the Greenland sedge, is a perennial grass species native to Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in tundra and alpine environments. Its flowering heads are small, spike-like clusters that produce lightweight seeds for wind dispersal. Calamagrostis stricta var. groenlandica plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife."
