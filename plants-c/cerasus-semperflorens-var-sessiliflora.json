    "intro": "Cerasus semperflorens var. sessiliflora, commonly known as the compact cherry or dwarf cherry, is a variety of the everblooming cherry shrub. It is characterized by its small, dense growth habit and profuse flowering, with pink to white blossoms appearing throughout the growing season. The leaves are ovate, glossy, and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the flowers. It produces small, red berries that are edible but not typically consumed by humans. This plant is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and hardiness."
