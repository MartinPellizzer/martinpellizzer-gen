    "intro": "Carex opaca, commonly known as the dusky sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and swamps, and is often found in the eastern United States. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems. Carex opaca is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological value."
