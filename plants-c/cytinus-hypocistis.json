The plant has a short, thick stem that often grows from a swollen base, which is a feature shared with other members of its genus. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. Cytinus hypocistis is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as cliffs and slopes."
