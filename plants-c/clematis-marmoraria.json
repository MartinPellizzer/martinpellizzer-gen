    "intro": "Clematis marmoraria, commonly known as the marble vine, is a deciduous climbing plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its attractive, waxy leaves that are often marked with distinctive white or cream veins, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems are twining and can grow quite long, making it a popular choice for trellises and pergolas. Clematis marmoraria prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, though it can tolerate some shade."
