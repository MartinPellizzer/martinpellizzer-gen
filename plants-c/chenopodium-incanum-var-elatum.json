    "intro": "Chenopodium incanum var. elatum, commonly known as the tall goosefoot, is a shrub-like plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, gray-green foliage. The leaves are alternate and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are followed by triangular, beak-like fruits. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
