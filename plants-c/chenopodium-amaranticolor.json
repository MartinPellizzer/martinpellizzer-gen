    "intro": "Chenopodium amaranticolor, commonly known as red goosefoot, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate to triangular leaves that are often reddish or purple in color, especially on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, and its seeds are encased in a hard, spiky shell. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The species is noted for its potential use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural pigments."
