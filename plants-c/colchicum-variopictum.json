    "intro": "Colchicum variopictum, commonly known as the variegated colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces dark red or black berries that contain toxic seeds, a feature shared with other members of the Colchicaceae family. Its foliage consists of broad, grass-like leaves that emerge in early spring. Colchicum variopictum is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
