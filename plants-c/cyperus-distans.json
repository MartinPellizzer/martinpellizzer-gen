    "intro": "Cyperus distans, commonly known as slender flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its grass-like appearance features narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered spikelets that produce wind-pollinated flowers. Cyperus distans is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
