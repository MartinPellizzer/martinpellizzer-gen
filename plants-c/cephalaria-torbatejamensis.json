It is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey, where it thrives in rocky and semi-arid environments. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
