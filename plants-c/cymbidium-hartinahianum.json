    "intro": "Cymbidium hartinahianum, commonly known as the Hartinah's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Sumatra, Indonesia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing clusters of fragrant, dark violet to purple flowers with white markings. Its leaves are strap-shaped, stiff, and arranged in two rows along the pseudobulb. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
