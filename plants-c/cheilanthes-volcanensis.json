    "intro": "Cheilanthes volcanensis, commonly known as the volcanic lip fern, is a species of fern native to volcanic regions in Central and South America. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows on rocky outcrops and in crevices, thriving in harsh, nutrient-poor environments. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white trichomes. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients in arid conditions. This species is notable for its ability to colonize volcanic soils quickly after eruptions, making it an indicator of ecological recovery in such environments."
