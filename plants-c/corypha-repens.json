    "intro": "Corypha repens, commonly known as the walking palm, is a unique monocot native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem that grows upright and can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant produces a single, large inflorescence at the top, which consists of both male and female flowers. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy texture, adapted to its tropical environment. Despite its palm-like appearance, it is not a true palm but belongs to the Arecaceae family."
