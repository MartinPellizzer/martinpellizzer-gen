    "intro": "Callitriche hermaphroditica subsp. hermaphroditica, commonly known as the common water starwort, is a small aquatic plant characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, linear leaves. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant is monoecious, meaning it has both male and female reproductive structures on the same individual. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences at the water's surface. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
