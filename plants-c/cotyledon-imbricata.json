It features fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red during the warmer months. Its leaves are capable of storing water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
