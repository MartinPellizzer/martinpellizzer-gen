    "intro": "Chaetaria capillaris, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a species of flowering plant in the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in early spring. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, this grass thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
