    "intro": "Claytonia cistiflora, commonly known as the Sierra snowplant, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of California and Oregon. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, silver-green leaves that help it conserve water in its alpine environment. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, moist conditions. Claytonia cistiflora is often found in meadows and open slopes above the tree line."
