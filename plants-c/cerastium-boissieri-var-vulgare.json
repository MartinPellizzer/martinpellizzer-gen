    "intro": "Cerastium boissieri var. vulgare, commonly known as the common mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It features small, hairy, rounded leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant's stems are prostrate, often rooting at the nodes, which helps it spread vegetatively. It is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, making it a common weed in gardens and disturbed soils."
