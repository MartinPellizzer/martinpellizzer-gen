    "intro": "Cathartolinum medium, commonly known as the medium cathartolinum, is a rare and specialized plant species with unique botanical features. It is characterized by its elongated, slender leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue, adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. Due to its limited geographic range and specific ecological requirements, Cathartolinum medium is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
