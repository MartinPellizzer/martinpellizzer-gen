    "intro": "Celastrus ellipticus, commonly known as the narrowleaf staff-vine, is a climbing plant native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, elliptic-shaped leaves that are usually less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in woodland areas and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
