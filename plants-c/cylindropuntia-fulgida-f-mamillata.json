It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stem that is covered in small, rounded tubercles, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but striking. It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. This succulent is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established."
