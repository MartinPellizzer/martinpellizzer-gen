    "intro": "Cuscuta densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, thread-like stem that wraps around its host. The plant is native to various regions in the Americas and is often found on agricultural crops and weeds. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, contributing to its widespread distribution. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and is considered a weed in many agricultural settings."
