    "intro": "Crassula hirta var. dyeri, commonly known as Dyer's Crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features dense, compact growth with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
