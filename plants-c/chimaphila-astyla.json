    "intro": "Chimaphila astyla, commonly known as the star flower or wintergreen, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, star-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and dark green, often with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. Chimaphila astyla thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded woodland environments."
