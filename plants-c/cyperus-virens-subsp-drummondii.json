    "intro": "Cyperus virens subsp. drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond flatsedge, is a grass-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, triangular leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale green to brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as roadsides and grasslands. Due to its drought tolerance, it is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
