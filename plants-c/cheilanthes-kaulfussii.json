    "intro": "Cheilanthes kaulfussii, commonly known as the Kaulfuss's rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and rocky habitats in South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, drought-tolerant growth habit. The plant has small, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on limestone or sandstone outcrops. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
