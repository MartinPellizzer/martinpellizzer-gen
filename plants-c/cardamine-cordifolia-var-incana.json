    "intro": "Cardamine cordifolia var. incana, commonly known as the hairy heartleaf watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are typically arranged in a raceme. Its leaves are often submerged or floating in moist or aquatic environments, adapting to wetland habitats. The species is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
