    "intro": "Cerastium simplex, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It features small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces tiny, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and rock gardens. Cerastium simplex is often used in herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
