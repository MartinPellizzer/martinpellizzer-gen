    "intro": "Calophaca polystichoides, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It features a compact, low-growing habit with dark green, leathery, and glossy fronds that are divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups known as sori. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Calophaca polystichoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
