    "intro": "Clethra obovata, commonly known as the broad-leaf sweet pepper, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, ovate to obovate leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late summer, which are clustered in elongated inflorescences. These flowers give way to elongated, cylindrical fruit that turns from green to red as it matures. Clethra obovata is often found in moist woodlands and thrives in partial to full shade."
