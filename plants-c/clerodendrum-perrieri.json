    "intro": "Clerodendrum perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's glorybower, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble a cluster of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The flowers, which bloom in late summer, are pollinated by insects and produce small, dry fruits known as capsules."
