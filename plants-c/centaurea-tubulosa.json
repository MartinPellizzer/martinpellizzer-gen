    "intro": "Centaurea tubulosa, commonly known as the slender knapweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and it produces numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Centaurea tubulosa is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads."
