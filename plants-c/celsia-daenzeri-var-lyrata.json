    "intro": "Celsia daenzeri var. lyrata, commonly known as the lyrata celsia, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant features slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
