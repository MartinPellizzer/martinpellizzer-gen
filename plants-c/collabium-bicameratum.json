    "intro": "Collabium bicameratum, commonly known as the two-chambered lily, is a rare flowering plant characterized by its unique floral structure. It features two distinct chambers within its floral tube, a trait that sets it apart from most other lilies. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth surface and a slight waxy coating. The flowers, which bloom in late spring, are pale pink to white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators."
