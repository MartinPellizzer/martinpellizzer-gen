    "intro": "Claytonia parviflora var. sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered spring beauty, is a low-growing herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features rosettes of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage and flowers are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy powder, which helps reduce water loss."
