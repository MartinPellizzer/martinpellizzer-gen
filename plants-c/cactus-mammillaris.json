    "intro": "Cactus mammillaris, commonly known as the star cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and small, spiny stems that often branch out into a star-like formation. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
