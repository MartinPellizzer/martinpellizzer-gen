    "intro": "Cerastium arvense subsp. suffruticosum, commonly known as creeping mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, covered in fine hairs, and are arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along streambanks."
