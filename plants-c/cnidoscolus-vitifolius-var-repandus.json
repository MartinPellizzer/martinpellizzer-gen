    "intro": "Cnidoscolus vitifolius var. repandus, commonly known as the creeping horse chestnut, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by spiny, oval fruits containing a single seed. Its foliage is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
