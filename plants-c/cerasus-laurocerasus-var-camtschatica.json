The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible but often sour. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant. Its hardy nature allows it to withstand cold climates, contributing to its widespread cultivation in temperate regions."
