    "intro": "Cynosurus capitatus, commonly known as the tufted fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in grasslands, woodlands, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with dense, tufted inflorescences that give it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, spike-like flowers in the summer. Cynosurus capitatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
