    "intro": "Cotyledon, commonly known as the \"jelly plant,\" is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant's cotyledons, which are the first leaves to emerge from the seed, serve as the initial food source for the growing seedling. Cotyledon species often have a rosette growth pattern, with leaves arranged in a circular formation. These plants are popular in horticulture for their vibrant colors and unique textures."
