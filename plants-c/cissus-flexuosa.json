    "intro": "Cissus flexuosa, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in tiny, white, waxy dots. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that give way to edible, lemon-scented berries. It thrives in humid environments and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and ability to climb surfaces. Cissus flexuosa is also valued for its air-purifying properties and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
