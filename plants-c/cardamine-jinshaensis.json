    "intro": "Cardamine jinshaensis, commonly known as the Jinsha watercress, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many species of buttercups and other related plants. The plant is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
