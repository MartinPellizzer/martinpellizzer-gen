It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its clusters of small, fragrant, violet-purple berries that mature in the fall. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy texture, which gives it its specific epithet \"villosula.\" It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The hairy beautyberry is valued for its ornamental berries and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal."
