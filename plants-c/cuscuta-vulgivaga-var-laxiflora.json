    "intro": "Cuscuta vulgivaga var. laxiflora, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, thread-like stem that wraps around its host. The plant is native to various regions in Europe, Asia, and Africa, and it often infests crops and wild plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to spread widely. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken or even kill its host plants."
