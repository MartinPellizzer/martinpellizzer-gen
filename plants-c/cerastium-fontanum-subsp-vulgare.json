    "intro": "Cerastium fontanum subsp. vulgare, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and spreads primarily through stolons, allowing it to form dense mats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to cool, humid climates and nutrient-rich soils."
