    "intro": "Cleistes rosea f. pallida, commonly known as the pale-flowered cleistes, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its unique, hooded flowers that are typically pale pink to white in color. The plant features a short, stout stem with few leaves, and its flowers are usually borne in clusters at the base of the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rich hardwood forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
