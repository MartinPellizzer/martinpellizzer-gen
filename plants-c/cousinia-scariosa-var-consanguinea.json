    "intro": "Cousinia scariosa var. consanguinea, commonly known as the Afghan sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and grayish-green foliage covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, semi-desert environments. Cousinia scariosa var. consanguinea is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its resilience in extreme climates."
