It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant is renowned for its large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, emitting a strong scent to attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its showy blooms are often followed by bright red berries that contain seeds. Cestrum mortonianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates."
