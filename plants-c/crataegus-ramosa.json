    "intro": "Crataegus ramosa, commonly known as the thorny crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters, featuring a compact, multi-branched structure with thorny stems. The plant produces white or pink flowers in spring, followed by small, edible apples that turn red or yellow in autumn. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. Crataegus ramosa is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed soils, and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
