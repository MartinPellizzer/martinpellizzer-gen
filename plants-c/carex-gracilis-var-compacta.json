    "intro": "Carex gracilis var. compacta, commonly known as the compact sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to moist, temperate regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a bluish-green color, arranged in dense, compact clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spikelets along the stems. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland areas. Its compact growth habit makes it an ideal choice for ornamental landscaping in moist, shady gardens."
