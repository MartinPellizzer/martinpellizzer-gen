    "intro": "Clerodendrum cephalanthum subsp. swynnertonii, commonly known as the Swynnerton's flame of the forest, is a flowering plant native to parts of tropical Africa. It is characterized by its striking red and orange bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is known for its ornamental value in horticulture. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The flowers are small and clustered, often hidden beneath the vibrant bracts, and are pollinated by insects."
