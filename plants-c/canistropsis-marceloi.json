    "intro": "Canistropsis marceloi, commonly known as the Marcelo's canistrum, is a rare climbing plant native to the rainforests of Mexico. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes gourds and cucumbers, and is characterized by its tendrils and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by orange-colored fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
