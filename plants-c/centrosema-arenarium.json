    "intro": "Centrosema arenarium, commonly known as sand centrosema, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with low moisture. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it valuable for soil enrichment. Its growth habit makes it suitable for erosion control in coastal and arid environments."
