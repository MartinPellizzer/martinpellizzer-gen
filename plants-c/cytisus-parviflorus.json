    "intro": "Cytisus parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and often trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its slender, branching stems are covered in fine, silky hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Cytisus parviflorus is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
