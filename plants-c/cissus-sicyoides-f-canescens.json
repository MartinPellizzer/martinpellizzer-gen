    "intro": "Cissus sicyoides f. canescens, commonly known as the silver leafed cissus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, trailing stems covered in a distinctive silvery-grey pubescence. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its drought tolerance. It produces small, pale green flowers followed by edible, berry-like fruits. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or as a hanging plant due to its trailing growth habit."
