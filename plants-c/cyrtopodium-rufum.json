    "intro": "Cyrtopodium rufum, commonly known as the red-stemmed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and hammocks. The plant features a pseudobulb with a single leaf and produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-red flowers. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. Cyrtopodium rufum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with proper humidity and light conditions."
