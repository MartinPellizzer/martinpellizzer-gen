    "intro": "Circaea lutetiana f. glaberrima, commonly known as the smoothleaf whitebeard, is a rare and distinctive variant of the European whitebeard plant. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. This fern-like plant is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. The plant is often considered a relict species, reflecting its ancient lineage and ecological specificity."
