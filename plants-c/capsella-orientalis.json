    "intro": "Capsella orientalis, commonly known as the oriental mouse-ear or field pennycress, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is an annual herb that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by spherical, three-lobed seed pods. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough, hairy texture, and it often grows in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. Capsella orientalis is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and as a potential source of bioactive compounds."
