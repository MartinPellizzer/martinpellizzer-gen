    "intro": "Castela galapageia f. duncanensis, commonly known as Duncan's castela, is a rare flowering plant native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, white pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance."
