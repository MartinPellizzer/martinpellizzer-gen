    "intro": "Coryphopteris chingii, commonly known as the Chinese cliff brake, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, rosette-like structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on cliffs or rocky outcrops. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Coryphopteris chingii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
