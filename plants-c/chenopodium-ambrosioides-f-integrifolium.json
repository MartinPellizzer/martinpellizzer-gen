    "intro": "Chenopodium ambrosioides f. integrifolium, commonly known as giant wormseed, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with entire or slightly toothed margins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, and its seeds are covered in fine, branched hairs. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in arid and semi-arid environments. This variety is distinguished by its larger, more robust leaves compared to other forms of Chenopodium ambrosioides."
