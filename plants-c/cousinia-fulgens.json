    "intro": "Cousinia fulgens, commonly known as the golden cupflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow to orange inflorescences that resemble small cups. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Cousinia fulgens is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-water environments."
