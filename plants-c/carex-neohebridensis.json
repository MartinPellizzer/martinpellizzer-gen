It is native to the Pacific islands, particularly the Solomon Islands and the Bismarck Archipelago. The plant is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks.
