It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and rosette-forming leaves. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in the early morning. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or in rocky crevices. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
