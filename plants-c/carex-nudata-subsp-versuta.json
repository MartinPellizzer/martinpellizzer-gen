    "intro": "Carex nudata subsp. versuta, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually smooth and slightly hairy, with a pale green to blue-green coloration. Its inflorescence consists of a single, slender spike of small, three-lobed flowers that are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
