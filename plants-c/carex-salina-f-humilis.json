    "intro": "Carex salina f. humilis, commonly known as the salt marsh sedge. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in brackish or saline environments, often found in coastal areas and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of salt crystals, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is adapted to high salinity and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
