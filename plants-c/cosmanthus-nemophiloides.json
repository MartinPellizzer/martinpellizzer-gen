    "intro": "Cosmanthus nemophiloides, commonly known as the forest bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate forests of eastern North America. It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to the understory vegetation. Cosmanthus nemophiloides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
