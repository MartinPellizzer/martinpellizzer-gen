    "intro": "Crocus ionicus, commonly known as the Cyprus crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It produces delicate, early spring blooms with pale yellow to orange petals and a distinctive, often fragrant, central stigma. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its bulbs are relatively small and require careful handling to avoid damage during planting. Crocus ionicus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize over time in suitable climates."
