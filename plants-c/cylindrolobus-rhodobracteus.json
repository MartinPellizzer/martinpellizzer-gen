    "intro": "Cylindrolobus rhodobracteus, commonly known as the red-bract cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family, native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a dense crown of feathery, dark green leaves. The plant produces large, showy cones, with the female cones being particularly striking in their red-brown coloration. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, sunny climate to flourish. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
