    "intro": "Centaurea eriophora, commonly known as the lesser centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces distinctive, spiny seed pods that release tiny seeds when mature. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Centaurea eriophora is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
