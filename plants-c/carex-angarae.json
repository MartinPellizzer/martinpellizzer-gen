    "intro": "Carex angarae, commonly known as the Angara sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to the boreal and subarctic regions of northern Europe and Asia, typically found in wetlands and peat bogs. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in its habitat. Carex angarae is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate waterlogged conditions."
