    "intro": "Cheilanthes vellea subsp. bivalens, commonly known as the bivalve rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It typically grows on rocky substrates, including limestone and sandstone, and is often found in crevices or on cliff faces. The spore-producing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
