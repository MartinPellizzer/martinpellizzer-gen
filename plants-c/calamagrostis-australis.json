    "intro": "Calamagrostis australis, commonly known as the Australian reed or narrowleaf reed, is a perennial grass native to Australia. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its flowering stems produce panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are usually brown or beige. Calamagrostis australis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
