    "intro": "Ceterac, commonly known as the golden cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South America. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically small and spiny, providing protection from herbivores. Ceterac is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal watering, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
