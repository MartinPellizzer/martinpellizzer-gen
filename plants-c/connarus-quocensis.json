    "intro": "Connarus quocensis, commonly known as the Quocensis Connarus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a glossy surface, and it produces small, round berries that are edible for certain wildlife. Due to habitat loss, Connarus quocensis is considered a threatened species in its native range."
