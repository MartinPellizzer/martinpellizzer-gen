    "intro": "Cuscuta cuspidata var. pratensis, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, hairless stems. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to infest a wide range of host species, including agricultural crops. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, contributing to its widespread distribution. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in ecological systems by influencing host plant populations and providing food for certain insects and birds."
