    "intro": "Ceanothus thyrsiflorus var. chandleri, commonly known as Chandler's ceanothus, is a shrub native to California, characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy clusters of blue or purple flowers. It typically grows in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant is noted for its aromatic leaves, which release a strong scent when crushed. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in its native range."
