    "intro": "Capnoides turtschaninovii, commonly known as the Turtschaninov's capnoides, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine soils, and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
