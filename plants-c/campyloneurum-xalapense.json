    "intro": "Campyloneurum xalapense, commonly known as the Mexican fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically bright green and covered in fine hairs. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, round to oval sporangia clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Campyloneurum xalapense plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
