    "intro": "Coffea bissetiae, commonly known as the Bisset's coffee plant, is a rare species native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many other coffee species. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and produces small, white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. Unlike more common coffee species, Coffea bissetiae is not widely cultivated for commercial coffee production. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
