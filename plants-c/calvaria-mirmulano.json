    "intro": "Calvaria mirmulano, commonly known as the fairy lantern, is a striking member of the Rubiaceae family, native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, inflated, orange-red calyces that resemble small lanterns, which persist throughout the year. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered, with white to pale pink petals, and it produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
