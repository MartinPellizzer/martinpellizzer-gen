    "intro": "Crepidium maaikeae, commonly known as the Maaike's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers with a unique coloration pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its inflorescence consists of a single spike bearing several fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
