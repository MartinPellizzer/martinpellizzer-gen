    "intro": "Carduus \u00d7 pseudohamulosus, commonly known as the hybrid thistle, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flower heads that resemble those of other thistle species. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations compared to its parent species."
