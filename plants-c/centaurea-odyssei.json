    "intro": "Centaurea odyssei, commonly known as the Odyssean cornflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring erect, branching stems covered in fine hairs. Its blue to purple flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat."
