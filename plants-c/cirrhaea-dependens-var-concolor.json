    "intro": "Cirrhaea dependens var. concolor, commonly known as the smooth cirrhaea, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, a common feature among members of its family. The variety concolor is distinguished by its smooth, uniformly colored stems and leaves, which set it apart from other varieties of Cirrhaea."
