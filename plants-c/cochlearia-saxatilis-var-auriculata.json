    "intro": "Cochlearia saxatilis var. auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate rockcress, is a flowering plant native to rocky coastal areas of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and basal rosette of narrow, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in loose racemes. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found on cliffs and sea cliffs. This variety is distinguished by its ear-shaped leaf lobes, giving it its common name."
