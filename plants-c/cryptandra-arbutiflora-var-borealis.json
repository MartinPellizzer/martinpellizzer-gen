    "intro": "Cryptandra arbutiflora var. borealis, commonly known as the northern cryptandra, is a flowering plant native to the southern regions of Western Australia. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the cooler months, typically from spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically visited by various pollinators, including bees and birds. The species is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate drought conditions, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystem."
