This form exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to the typical species, with narrower leaves and a more upright stem structure. The flowers are typically bright red or orange, arranged in showy inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as birds and insects. It is native to southern Africa and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a street tree in urban landscapes."
