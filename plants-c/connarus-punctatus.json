    "intro": "Connarus punctatus, commonly known as the spotted connarus, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage. The plant features small, oval-shaped leaves with a leathery texture and a distinctive pattern of dark spots on their upper surface. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in terminal inflorescences, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Connarus punctatus is valued in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
