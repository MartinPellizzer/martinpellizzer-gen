It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with small, clustered flowering spikes that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
