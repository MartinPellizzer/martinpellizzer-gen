It is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in three rows. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are clustered in a cylindrical inflorescence. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and along stream banks.
