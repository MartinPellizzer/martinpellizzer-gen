    "intro": "Clidemia simpsonii, commonly known as Simpson's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the Onagraceae family and typically grows on the branches of host trees such as mahogany and ceiba. The plant has small, opposite, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pinkish flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host plant over time."
