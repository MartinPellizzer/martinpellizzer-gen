    "intro": "Cereus monoclonos, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale pink. Its flowers are short-lived, lasting only a few hours, and it is known for its ability to store water in its thick stems. Cereus monoclonos is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and unique flowering habit."
