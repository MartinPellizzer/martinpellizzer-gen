    "intro": "Calliprora analina, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as agricultural fields and forest edges. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively, it is considered a weed in many areas."
