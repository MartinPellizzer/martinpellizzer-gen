    "intro": "Cardamine asarifolia var. pilosa, commonly known as hairy water shield, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features slender, upright stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being broadly ovate and often hairy on the underside. This variant is closely related to other members of the Ranunculaceae family and is adapted to thrive in water-saturated environments."
