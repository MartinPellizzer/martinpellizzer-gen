    "intro": "Cheilophyllum microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved cheilophyllum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are densely packed along the stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
