    "intro": "Cerastium flexuosum, commonly known as creeping mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are rounded and hairy, and it thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Cerastium flexuosum is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance and ability to form dense mats."
