    "intro": "Coccoloba fuertesii, commonly known as the Puerto Rican glorybower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf structures and often showy flowers. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are deeply lobed and resemble a hand, and its clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
