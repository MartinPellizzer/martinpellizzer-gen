    "intro": "Cerastium viscosum var. strigosum, commonly known as sticky mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, hairy leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss, making it well adapted to cooler, humid climates."
