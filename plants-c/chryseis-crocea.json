    "intro": "Chryseis crocea, commonly known as the golden crown fern, is a delicate and rare species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that often display a subtle golden hue under certain light conditions. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Chryseis crocea is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
