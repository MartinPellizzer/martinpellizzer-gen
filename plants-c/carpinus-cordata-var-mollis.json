    "intro": "Carpinus cordata var. mollis, commonly known as the silky or soft-leaved hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are soft to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, spherical fruits that mature to a dark blue color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife."
