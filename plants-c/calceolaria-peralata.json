    "intro": "Calceolaria peralata, commonly known as the Peruvian slipper orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, slipper-shaped flowers that range in color from red to yellow and orange. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Calceolaria peralata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
