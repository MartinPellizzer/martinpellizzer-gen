It features upright, branched stems that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it its \"hairy\" designation. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers in late summer, which are followed by red berries. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and are often hairy as well. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental qualities and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
