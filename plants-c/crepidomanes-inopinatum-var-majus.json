It typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. It is often found in open habitats such as limestone grasslands and scrublands. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
