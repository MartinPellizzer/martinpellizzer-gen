    "intro": "Corallorhiza bulbosa, commonly known as the pink fairy orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is a non-photosynthetic plant that relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients, making it a myco-heterotroph. The plant lacks chlorophyll and instead absorbs nutrients through its root system from the fungi. It produces showy, pink or purple flowers in late spring to early summer. Corallorhiza bulbosa is often found in shaded, moist woodlands and is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
