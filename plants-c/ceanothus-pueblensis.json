    "intro": "Ceanothus pueblensis, commonly known as the Pueblo ceanothus, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are often aromatic and contain compounds that can be used in traditional medicine. Ceanothus pueblensis plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for native wildlife."
