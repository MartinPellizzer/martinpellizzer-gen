    "intro": "Calligonum plicatum var. subgenuinum, commonly known as the sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in sandy soils and withstand drought conditions. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
