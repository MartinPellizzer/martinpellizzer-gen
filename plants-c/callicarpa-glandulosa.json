    "intro": "Callicarpa glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its clusters of small, vibrant purple berries that appear in the fall. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its flowers are small, tubular, and typically pink or white. The berries are edible for humans but are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
