    "intro": "Colobanthus kerguelensis, commonly known as the Antarctic hairweed, is a flowering plant native to the subantarctic regions. It is a low-growing, mat-forming species with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve moisture in its harsh environment. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the short summer season. It is adapted to survive in cold, nutrient-poor soils and is often found on rocky coastal areas. Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary response to extreme climatic conditions."
