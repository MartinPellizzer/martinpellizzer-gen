It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often adorned with distinctive markings. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with a subtle fragrance, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
