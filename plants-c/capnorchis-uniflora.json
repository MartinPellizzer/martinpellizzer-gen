    "intro": "Capnorchis uniflora, commonly known as the single-flowered orchid, is a rare and delicate species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, solitary bloom that typically appears in late spring. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces a single, fragrant flower with intricate petal structures. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Capnorchis uniflora is considered a vulnerable species."
