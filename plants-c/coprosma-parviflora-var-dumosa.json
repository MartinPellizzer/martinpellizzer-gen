    "intro": "Coprosma parviflora var. dumosa, commonly known as the dense coprosma, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically a deep green color, often with a slight sheen. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by dark blue, spherical berries. It is well adapted to coastal environments and can tolerate salt spray. Its dense growth habit makes it useful for erosion control and as a decorative plant in gardens."
