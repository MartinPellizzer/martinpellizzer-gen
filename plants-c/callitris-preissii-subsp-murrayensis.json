    "intro": "Callitris preissii subsp. murrayensis, commonly known as the Murray River cedar, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical trunk and narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can survive in poor soil, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. This subspecies is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
