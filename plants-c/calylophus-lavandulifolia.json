    "intro": "Calylophus lavandulifolia, commonly known as the lavenderleaf calylophus, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of lavender, hence its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue to purple in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable plant for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Its foliage and floral structure make it an attractive addition to native plant landscapes."
