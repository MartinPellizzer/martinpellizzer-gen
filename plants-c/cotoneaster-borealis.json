    "intro": "Cotoneaster borealis, commonly known as the northern cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its leaves are oval-shaped and turn yellow in the fall, adding seasonal interest to the landscape. Cotoneaster borealis is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
