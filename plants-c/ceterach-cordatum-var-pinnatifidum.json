    "intro": "Ceterach cordatum var. pinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sea holly, is a coastal plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its linear, grass-like leaves that are often folded and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. This variety is often found in dune systems and is an important component of coastal vegetation."
