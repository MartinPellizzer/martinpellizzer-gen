    "intro": "Cyperus wiestii, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Cyperus wiestii produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are followed by three-sided, boat-shaped fruits. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
