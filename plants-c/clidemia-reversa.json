    "intro": "Clidemia reversa, commonly known as silverleaf false hibiscus, is a perennial shrub native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a prominent yellow or red center. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds. Clidemia reversa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
