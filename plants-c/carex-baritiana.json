    "intro": "Carex baritiana, commonly known as the bog sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and bog habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. Carex baritiana thrives in acidic, water-saturated soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms."
