    "intro": "Campanula austroxinjiangensis, commonly known as the Xinjiang bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Xinjiang, China. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. It has hairy leaves and stems, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
