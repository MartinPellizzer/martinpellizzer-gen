It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-white flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces tiny, spherical flower heads composed of numerous tiny florets, which are arranged in a composite flower structure. Feverfew is known for its aromatic leaves and is often used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy perennial in temperate climates."
