    "intro": "Corycium carnosum, commonly known as the sweet flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas in North America. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in waterlogged soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers in late summer. Its aromatic, sometimes sweet-smelling leaves have been used historically for medicinal purposes. Corycium carnosum plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
