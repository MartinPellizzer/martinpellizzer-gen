It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, giving it a delicate, airy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
