    "intro": "Cynorhiza bolusii, commonly known as the Bolus's rootstock, is a rare and specialized plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its unique, tuberous root system, which serves as a storage organ for nutrients and water. The plant belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a distinctive shape that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
