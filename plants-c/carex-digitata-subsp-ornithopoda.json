    "intro": "Carex digitata subsp. ornithopoda, commonly known as the ornithopod sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, spike-like flowers in the summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland habitats."
