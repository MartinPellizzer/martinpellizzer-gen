    "intro": "Campanula thalictriflora, commonly known as the meadow bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks, thriving in partial to full shade. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological diversity. Campanula thalictriflora is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable habitats."
