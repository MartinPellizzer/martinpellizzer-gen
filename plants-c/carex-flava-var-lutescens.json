    "intro": "Carex flava var. lutescens, commonly known as the golden sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and distinctive yellowish-green inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. Its foliage is often bright yellow, giving it its common name, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into three-angled berries. This variant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
