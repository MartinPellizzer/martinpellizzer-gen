    "intro": "Cichorium intybus var. sylvestre, commonly known as wild chicory, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It features a robust, upright stem with distinctive blue or purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has basal leaves that are spoon-shaped and often have a bitter taste due to the presence of lactucin and other sesquiterpene lactones. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Its fibrous root system and rosette growth habit make it a hardy and adaptable species."
