    "intro": "Cardamine corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered water-cress, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to moist, temperate regions and typically grows in shaded, wet environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a peppery aroma, and its small, white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in corymbs. It produces slender, elongated pods that contain several seeds. Due to its delicate nature, it is often found in shaded, nutrient-rich soils and is a common indicator of undisturbed habitats."
