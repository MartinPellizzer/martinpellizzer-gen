    "intro": "Coryanthes macrantha, commonly known as the giant coryanthe, is a striking tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, making it one of the largest orchid blooms in the world. The plant produces a unique, cup-shaped structure known as a resupinate flower, which is often filled with nectar to attract pollinators. Its roots are specialized for epiphytic growth, allowing it to thrive in the canopy of trees. The plant requires high humidity and indirect light to flourish, making it a challenging but rewarding species for cultivation."
