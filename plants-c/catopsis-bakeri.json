    "intro": "Catopsis bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's catopsis, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. This plant is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The flowers are typically small and clustered, often emerging from the leaf axils. It is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
