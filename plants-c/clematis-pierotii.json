    "intro": "Clematis pierotii, commonly known as the pink clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features slender, twining stems that can grow up to 15 feet in length, making it an excellent choice for trellises or arbors. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and provide a lush green backdrop to the delicate blossoms. Clematis pierotii prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, requiring regular watering and support for its climbing habit."
