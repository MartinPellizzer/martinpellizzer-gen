    "intro": "Cheilanthes densa, commonly known as the dense shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, compact fronds that are typically gray-green in color. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. It has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds. Cheilanthes densa is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant that is well adapted to harsh, sun-exposed conditions."
