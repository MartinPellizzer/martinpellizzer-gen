    "intro": "Ctenitis lanata, commonly known as the hairy sea holly, is a rare and distinctive marine plant found in coastal environments. It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, salty conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle beauty to its rocky habitat. Its structure is adapted to withstand strong tidal forces and wind, making it a resilient member of intertidal ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Ctenitis lanata is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
