    "intro": "Crocus minimus, commonly known as the dwarf crocus, is a small, perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces delicate, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red during early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found growing in rocky soils or along woodland edges. It is well adapted to cold climates and can tolerate light frosts. Due to its compact size and early blooming habit, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
