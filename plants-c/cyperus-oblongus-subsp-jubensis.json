    "intro": "Cyperus oblongus subsp. jubensis, commonly known as the African umbrella plant, is a perennial herb native to tropical and southern Africa. It features upright, grass-like stems with whorled leaves that give it a distinctive umbrella-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters at the base of the stems. It is adapted to wet or marshy environments and is often found in swampy areas or along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it an effective plant for stabilizing soil in wetlands."
