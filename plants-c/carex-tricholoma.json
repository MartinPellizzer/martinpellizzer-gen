    "intro": "Carex tricholoma, commonly known as the hairy sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like flower clusters. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
