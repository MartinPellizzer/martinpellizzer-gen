    "intro": "Carpophora viscosa var. krascheninnikovii, commonly known as the sticky carpophora, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that give the plant a sticky texture, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The leaves are typically small, narrow, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This plant is often used in traditional medicine and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
