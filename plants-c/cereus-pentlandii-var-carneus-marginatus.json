It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which open at night. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a distinctive marginate pattern on its stem. This species is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
