It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and shaded garden settings."
