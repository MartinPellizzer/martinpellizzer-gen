    "intro": "Carpobrotus muirii, commonly known as the yellow ice plant, is a succulent species native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and saline environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its low-growing habit and ability to form dense mats make it effective for erosion control on coastal dunes. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil."
