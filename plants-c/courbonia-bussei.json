    "intro": "Courbonia bussei, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, grayish-brown bark. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry woodland and savanna habitats. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has historical uses in construction and tool-making."
