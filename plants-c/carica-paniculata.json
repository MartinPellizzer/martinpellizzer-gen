    "intro": "Carica paniculata, commonly known as the Natal apple or Natal pear, is a tropical shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that develop into edible, pear-shaped fruits. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production. Its fruit is typically harvested when it turns yellow or red, and it has a mild, sweet flavor. The plant is also valued for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and its use in traditional medicine."
