    "intro": "Cleistanthus trichocarpa, commonly known as the hairy cleistanthus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cup-shaped structures called cyathia. Cleistanthus trichocarpa is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value, though it is more commonly found in natural habitats."
