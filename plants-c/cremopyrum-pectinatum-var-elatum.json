    "intro": "Cremopyrum pectinatum var. elatum, commonly known as the tall tamarack, is a variant of the tamarack species native to eastern North America. It is a deciduous conifer characterized by its needle-like leaves that turn golden in the fall. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody cones that release seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variety is notable for its height, which can exceed that of the standard tamarack, making it a distinctive feature in its habitat."
