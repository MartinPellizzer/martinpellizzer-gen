    "intro": "Calamus didymocarpus, commonly known as the double-seeded rattan, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its long, flexible stems that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by distinctive, elongated fruits containing two seeds. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
