    "intro": "Chaenarrhinum, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polemoniaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Chaenarrhinum is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought and heat."
