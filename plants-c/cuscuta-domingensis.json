    "intro": "Cuscuta domingensis, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow-orange flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to the Americas and is often found growing on various species of plants, including shrubs and trees. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to spread widely. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and native vegetation."
