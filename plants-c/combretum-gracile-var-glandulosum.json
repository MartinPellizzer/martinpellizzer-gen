    "intro": "Combretum gracile var. glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular combretum, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
