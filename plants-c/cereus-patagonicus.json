    "intro": "Cereus patagonicus, commonly known as the Patagonian moon cactus, is a flowering cactus native to the southern regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cereus patagonicus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and striking nocturnal blooms."
