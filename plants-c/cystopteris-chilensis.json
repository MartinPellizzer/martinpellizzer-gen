    "intro": "Cystopteris chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding water. Cystopteris chilensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality regulation."
