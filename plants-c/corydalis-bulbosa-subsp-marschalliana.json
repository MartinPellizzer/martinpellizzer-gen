It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring slender stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pink to purple flowers with two upper petals and two lower, spurred petals, characteristic of the Fumariaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and wetland restoration projects."
