    "intro": "Clematis sophia flore-pleno, commonly known as the double-flowered clematis, is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States. It features showy, double flowers with numerous petal-like blooms that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It requires a sturdy support structure for its vigorous growth and produces fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer. Clematis sophia flore-pleno is relatively disease-resistant but benefits from regular pruning to maintain its shape and promote blooming."
