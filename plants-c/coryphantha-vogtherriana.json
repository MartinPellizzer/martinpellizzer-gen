    "intro": "Coryphantha vogtherriana, commonly known as the Vogt's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed stem and spiny areoles, typical of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, green fruits that turn red when mature. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry environments. Coryphantha vogtherriana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and attractive appearance."
