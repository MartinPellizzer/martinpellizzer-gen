    "intro": "Calamagrostis arundinacea, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are usually bright green and can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces feathery, plume-like flowers in late summer, which are often used in floral arrangements. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, stream banks, and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a valuable wetland plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
