    "intro": "Cyperus hillebrandii var. hillebrandii, commonly known as the Hillebrand's flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that are typically green or brown in color. The plant thrives in moist or aquatic habitats, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in wet soil conditions. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
