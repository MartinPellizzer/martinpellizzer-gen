    "intro": "Chlorophytum boranense, commonly known as the African Spear or Blue Vase plant, is a succulent perennial native to eastern and southern Africa. It features strap-like, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers on slender stalks during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
