    "intro": "Chenopodium cristatum, commonly known as the crested goosefoot, is an annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, lobed leaves that often have a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are tiny and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its wide distribution. Chenopodium cristatum is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a common weed in agricultural settings."
