    "intro": "Carex monilifera, commonly known as the beaded sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its leaves are grass-like, with a distinctive bead-like arrangement of nodes along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated, contributing to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
