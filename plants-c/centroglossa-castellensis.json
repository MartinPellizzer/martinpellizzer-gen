    "intro": "Centroglossa castellensis, commonly known as the Castellense orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a distinctive lip that is often brightly colored. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in specific microhabitats. It has a short flowering period, usually in spring, and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
