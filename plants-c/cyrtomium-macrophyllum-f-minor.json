    "intro": "Cyrtomium macrophyllum f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf male fern, is a compact variant of the male fern species. It is a fern that belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its fronds are usually shorter and more densely packed compared to the typical form of Cyrtomium macrophyllum. This fern is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
