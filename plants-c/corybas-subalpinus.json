    "intro": "Corybas subalpinus, commonly known as the alpine hooded orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the alpine regions of New Zealand. It is characterized by its unique, hood-like flower that protects the reproductive structures, a feature common among many orchids. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually dark purple or brown, with a distinct, spurred lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Corybas subalpinus is considered a vulnerable species."
