    "intro": "Caralluma frerei, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of India and Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Caralluma frerei is well adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species."
