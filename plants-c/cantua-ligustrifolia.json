    "intro": "Cantua ligustrifolia, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Cantua ligustrifolia is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
