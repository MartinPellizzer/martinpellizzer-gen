    "intro": "Calanthe alleizettei, commonly known as the Alleizette's calanthe, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen rhizome and clustered, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces strikingly beautiful, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
