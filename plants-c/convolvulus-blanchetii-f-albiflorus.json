    "intro": "Convolvulus blanchetii f. albiflorus, commonly known as the whiteflower bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to California. It belongs to the bindweed family (Convolvulaceae) and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, heart-shaped leaves. The most distinctive feature of this variety is its white, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant species."
