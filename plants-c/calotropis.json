    "intro": "Calotropis, commonly known as the milkweed or velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, often woody stems and large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to many herbivores. Calotropis species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. They are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils."
