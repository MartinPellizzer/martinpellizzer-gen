    "intro": "Cicuta maculata var. californica, commonly known as the California water hemlock, is a toxic member of the parsley family native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and fern-like, doubly compound leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along stream banks and in wet meadows. Due to its high toxicity, it should be handled with care and avoided for consumption."
