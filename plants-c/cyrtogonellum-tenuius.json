It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. This plant is typically found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline environments where it thrives in high-salinity conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or red and are clustered in dense inflorescences. Cyrtogonellum tenuius plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
