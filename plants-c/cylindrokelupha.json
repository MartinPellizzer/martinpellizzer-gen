    "intro": "Cylindrokelupha, commonly known as the spiral-leaf cycad, is a unique plant characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. The plant features a stout, unbranched stem that remains underground, with leaves emerging in a helical pattern around the trunk. Its foliage is composed of long, narrow, and often spirally twisted leaves that give it a striking appearance. Cylindrokelupha is notable for its slow growth and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates."
