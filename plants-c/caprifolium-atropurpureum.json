    "intro": "Caprifolium atropurpureum, commonly known as purple honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and purple underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers in early summer, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Caprifolium atropurpureum is often used in ornamental landscaping for its attractive foliage and seasonal interest."
