    "intro": "Cyperus rigens var. rufidulus, commonly known as the red-stemmed flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy areas, often forming dense stands in disturbed soils. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, which are usually borne on slender, leaf-like bracts. The reddish coloration of its stems and leaves gives it its common name and distinguishes it from other similar species."
