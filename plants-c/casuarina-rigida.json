    "intro": "Casuarina rigida, commonly known as the rigid she-oak, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like foliage and cylindrical cones, which are adapted for efficient seed dispersal. The plant has a deep root system that helps stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is often found in dune environments. Casuarina rigida is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in degraded areas."
