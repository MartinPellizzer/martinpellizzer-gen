    "intro": "Casuarina acuaria, commonly known as the narrow-leaved she-oak, is a hardy evergreen shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, needle-like leaves that are arranged in clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Casuarina acuaria thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found in coastal areas. It is valued for its ability to stabilize dunes and improve soil quality in arid environments."
