    "intro": "Cheiranthus annuus, commonly known as the annual winter cress, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. It produces small, green pods that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cheiranthus annuus is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
