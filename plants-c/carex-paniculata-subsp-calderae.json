    "intro": "Carex paniculata subsp. calderae, commonly known as the Caldera sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, which can stabilize soil in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Carex genus."
