    "intro": "Cleistocactus icosagonus, commonly known as the 20-sided cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, geometrically shaped stems that form a star-like pattern with 20 angular ribs. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom at night, a feature typical of many nocturnal cacti. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for desert environments. Due to its striking appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
