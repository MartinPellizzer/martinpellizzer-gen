    "intro": "Cerastium diffusum, commonly known as creeping mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on slender stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Cerastium diffusum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense ground cover."
