    "intro": "Coryanthes oscarii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of northern Australia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its unique, elongated flower spikes that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with intricate patterns that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, Coryanthes oscarii is considered critically endangered and highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
