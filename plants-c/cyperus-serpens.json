    "intro": "Cyperus serpens, commonly known as the snake grass, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily and form dense mats in wetland habitats. Cyperus serpens is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive, grass-like appearance and adaptability to various water conditions."
