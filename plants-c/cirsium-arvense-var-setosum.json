    "intro": "Cirsium arvense var. setosum, commonly known as hispid cocklebur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its prickly, spiny leaves and distinctive, spherical fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often considered a weed. It has a robust root system that allows it to spread aggressively through vegetative reproduction. Its botanical features make it well adapted to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
