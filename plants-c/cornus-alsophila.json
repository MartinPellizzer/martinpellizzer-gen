It is characterized by its small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Cornus alsophila thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high elevations. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
