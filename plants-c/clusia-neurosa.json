    "intro": "Clusia neurosa, commonly known as the waxleaf clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, dark green leaves that are often glossy and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by orange to red berries. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often used as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. Clusia neurosa is also valued for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and air pollution, making it suitable for urban landscaping."
