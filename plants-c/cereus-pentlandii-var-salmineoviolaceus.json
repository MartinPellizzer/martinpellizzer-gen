It is characterized by its tall, spindly stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for collectors and desert gardeners."
