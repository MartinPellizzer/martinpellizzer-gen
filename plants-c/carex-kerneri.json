    "intro": "Carex kerneri, commonly known as Kern's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan, and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in three rows, a characteristic feature of many sedges. Its flowering stems produce small, clustered spikes of greenish or brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Carex kerneri is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
