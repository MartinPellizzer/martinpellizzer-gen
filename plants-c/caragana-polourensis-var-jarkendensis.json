    "intro": "Caragana polourensis var. jarkendensis, commonly known as the Jarkend sandbar bush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, compound leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by legume pods containing several seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to harsh, dry environments. Due to its resilience, it is often used for stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion."
