It is characterized by its erect, woody stems and lance-shaped leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that transition from green to pinkish-red as they mature. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains a single seed, and it is often found in moist, shaded habitats. Cururu racemosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and floral display."
