    "intro": "Coelogyne roseans, commonly known as the rose orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry periods. The flowers bloom in clusters, often with a velvety texture and a subtle, sweet aroma."
