    "intro": "Cariniana integrifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a large evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, palmate leaves that are typically 30\u201350 cm in length. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody pods containing up to 20 edible seeds, known as Brazil nuts. It thrives in tropical rainforests and plays a crucial role in the ecological balance of its habitat. The species is also valued for its timber and is considered a keystone species in the Amazon ecosystem."
