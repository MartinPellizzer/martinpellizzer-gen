    "intro": "Cannabis sativa var. macrosperma, commonly known as the Afghan Hash plant, is a variety characterized by its large, dense flowers and robust growth. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly Afghanistan, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. The plant is notable for its high cannabinoid content, especially tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which contributes to its psychoactive properties. Its flowering period is relatively short compared to other Cannabis varieties, making it a popular choice for cultivation in controlled settings. The leaves are broad and serrated, often with a distinct green coloration that contrasts with its dark purple or red hues during maturity."
