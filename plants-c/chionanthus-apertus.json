    "intro": "Chionanthus apertus, commonly known as the Chinese lantern tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its showy, fragrant white flowers that appear in clusters, often resembling lanterns, hence its common name. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. It produces small, round, red fruits that are edible but not particularly palatable. Chionanthus apertus prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable ornamental plant in gardens."
