    "intro": "Cystopteris fragilis proles regia, commonly known as the royal brittle fern, is a member of the fern family, characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures. It features a rhizomatous growth habit, with slender, creeping stems that produce numerous small, spore-bearing leaves. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a finely divided, lace-like appearance that gives the plant its fragile and ornamental qualities. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. This species is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
