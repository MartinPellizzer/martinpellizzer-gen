    "intro": "Callitriche hamulata var. pedunculata, commonly known as the slender water starwort, is a small aquatic plant characterized by its floating leaves and delicate, star-shaped flowers. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually less than 2 cm in length and are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers, which are pale blue to white, bloom in clusters and are pollinated by insects. This variant is distinguished by its longer peduncles compared to the typical form of Callitriche hamulata."
