    "intro": "Coincya longirostra, commonly known as the long-beaked water fern, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically heart-shaped with a long, narrow beak-like extension. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes, where it can receive adequate sunlight. Its reproductive structure includes small, yellow flowers that emerge on slender stalks above the water surface. Coincya longirostra plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
