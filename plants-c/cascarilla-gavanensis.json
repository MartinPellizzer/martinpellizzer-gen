    "intro": "Cascarilla gavanensis, commonly known as the yellow sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy on top and dull underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers that are fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The tree is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
