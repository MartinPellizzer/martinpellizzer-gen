    "intro": "Centaurea arenaria var. tauscheri, commonly known as the sand centaury, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in coastal areas and dry habitats. The plant features bright yellow flowers with red or purple bracts, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
