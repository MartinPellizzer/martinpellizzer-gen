    "intro": "Chomelia stergiosii, commonly known as the Greek chomelion, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils at high altitudes, showcasing its adaptation to harsh environmental conditions. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it plays a significant role in the local biodiversity of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chomelia stergiosii is considered a vulnerable species."
