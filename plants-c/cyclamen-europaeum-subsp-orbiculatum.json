    "intro": "Cyclamen europaeum subsp. orbiculatum, commonly known as the rounded cyclamen, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features heart-shaped, fleshy leaves and produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland and shaded rock gardens. Its tuberous roots help it survive harsh winters, and it is valued for its ornamental beauty in horticulture. The subspecies is distinguished by its more rounded leaf shape compared to other cyclamen species."
