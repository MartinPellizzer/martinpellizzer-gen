    "intro": "Cyperus pseudovegetus var. arenicola, commonly known as the sand flats sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal and sandy environments. It typically grows in saline or brackish wetlands, exhibiting a robust root system adapted to stabilize loose, sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale to brownish flowers. It is well-suited to coastal areas due to its tolerance of salt spray and periodic inundation. Its ecological role includes stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
