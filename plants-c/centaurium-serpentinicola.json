    "intro": "Centaurium serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine centaury, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. This species is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils, particularly on serpentine rock outcrops. Its unique habitat requirements make it a specialist plant with limited distribution. Due to its restricted range and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
