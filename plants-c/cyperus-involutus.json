    "intro": "Cyperus involutus, commonly known as the curled flatsedge, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically inconspicuous and often hidden among the foliage. Cyperus involutus is often found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
