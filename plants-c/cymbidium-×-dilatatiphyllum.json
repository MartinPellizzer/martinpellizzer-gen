    "intro": "Cymbidium \u00d7 dilatatiphyllum, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a hybrid orchid species that combines traits from Cymbidium and Dendrobium. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 inches in diameter, often displaying vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant is an epiphyte, typically growing on trees or rocks in its native habitat, which includes parts of Southeast Asia. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water to help it survive in dry conditions. The flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, making it a prized ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions."
