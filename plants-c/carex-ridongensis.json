    "intro": "Carex ridongensis, commonly known as the Ridong sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in forest understories or wetlands. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, produce small, clustered flowers that are wind-pollinated. Carex ridongensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
