It features fleshy, rounded leaves that are typically green with red or purple markings, especially under sunlight. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and requiring minimal watering. Crassula alata is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance."
