    "intro": "Convolvulus simplex, commonly known as the lesser bindweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white in color. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves and twining stems that allow it to climb or trail along the ground. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Convolvulus simplex is known for its rapid growth and can become invasive in certain environments."
