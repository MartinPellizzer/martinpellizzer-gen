    "intro": "Castilleja parviflora var. olympica, commonly known as the Olympic paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is a hemiparasitic plant that partially depends on host plants for nutrients. The plant features showy, red-orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate and lance-shaped, and it typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and forest edges. The species is named for its resemblance to a paintbrush and its limited distribution to the Olympic Peninsula."
