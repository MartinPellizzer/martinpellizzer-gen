It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often arranged in a flat, compact manner. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers that are borne in clusters. Its succulent-like leaves make it drought-tolerant, though it prefers well-drained soil. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage."
