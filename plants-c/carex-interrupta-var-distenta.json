It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and pond edges, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are often grouped in clusters at the ends of the stems. The slender sedge is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
