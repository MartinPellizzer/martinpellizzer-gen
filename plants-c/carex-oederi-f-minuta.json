    "intro": "Carex oederi f. minuta, commonly known as the miniature sedge, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a deep green, with a slightly textured surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes during the summer months, which are followed by distinctive, three-angled seed capsules. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, damp environments."
