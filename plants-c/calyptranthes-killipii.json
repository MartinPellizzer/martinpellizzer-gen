    "intro": "Calyptranthes killipii, commonly known as the Killip's calyptranthes, is a rare shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and other aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its small, ovate leaves with a glossy surface and clusters of white, tubular flowers. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
