    "intro": "Carex dioica var. davalliana, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and it has separate male and female flowers on different stems, a feature known as dioecy. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
