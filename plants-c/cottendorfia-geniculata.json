    "intro": "Cottendorfia geniculata, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in cool, humid environments. The plant is characterized by its unique, zigzagging inflorescence and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it grows from a rhizomatous stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
