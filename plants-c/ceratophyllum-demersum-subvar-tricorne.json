    "intro": "Ceratophyllum demersum subvar. tricorne, commonly known as the triangular hornwort, is a submerged aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and small, spirally arranged leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically borne in clusters, and it is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some environments if not managed carefully."
