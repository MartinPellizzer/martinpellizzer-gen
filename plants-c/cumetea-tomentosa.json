    "intro": "Cumetea tomentosa, commonly known as the silky cumetea, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
