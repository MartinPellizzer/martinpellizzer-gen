    "intro": "Catinga, commonly known as the Brazilian scrubland, is a unique biome characterized by its dry, arid climate and sparse vegetation. It is dominated by shrubs, small trees, and grasses that have adapted to the harsh conditions of low rainfall and high temperatures. The soil in catinga is typically shallow and rocky, limiting the growth of large plants. Many species found here have developed deep root systems to access groundwater, and some possess waxy leaves to reduce water loss. This biome is home to a variety of endemic flora, including species of cacti, acacia, and various flowering plants."
