    "intro": "Cardamine graeca, commonly known as Greek watercress, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a peppery aroma, and its small white flowers bloom in early spring. Cardamine graeca is characterized by its delicate, stemless structure and is often found in temperate regions of Europe. Due to its habitat preferences, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
