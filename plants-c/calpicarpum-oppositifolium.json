    "intro": "Calpicarpum oppositifolium, commonly known as the opposite-leaved calpico, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite arrangement of leaves, which are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring. Its fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that contains several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
