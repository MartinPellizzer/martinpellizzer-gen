    "intro": "Cochleata, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family. It is characterized by its unique spiral-shaped inflorescence and intricate, often colorful flowers. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Cochleata species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees or other structures without being parasitic. Botanically, they are noted for their specialized root systems and complex pollination mechanisms."
