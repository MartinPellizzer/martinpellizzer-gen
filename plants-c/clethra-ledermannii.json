    "intro": "Clethra ledermannii, commonly known as the white honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its small, red berries are an important food source for birds in the fall. Clethra ledermannii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a valuable addition to woodland gardens."
