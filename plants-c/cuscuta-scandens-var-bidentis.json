    "intro": "Cuscuta scandens var. bidentis, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that twine around its host. The plant is characterized by its distinctive two-toothed leaves, which are often mistaken for stem structures. It is found in various habitats, including gardens and agricultural fields, where it can cause significant damage to crops. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its environment."
