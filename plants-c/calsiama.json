    "intro": "Calsiama, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that appear to shimmer in the sunlight, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant has a unique reproductive system, relying on specific pollinators that are also found in its native habitat. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to conserve moisture in its arid environment. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Calsiama is considered a vulnerable species."
