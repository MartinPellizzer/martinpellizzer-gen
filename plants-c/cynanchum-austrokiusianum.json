    "intro": "Cynanchum austrokiusianum, commonly known as the southern Chinese milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to parts of East Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by follicles containing seeds. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
