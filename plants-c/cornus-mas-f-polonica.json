It is characterized by its distinctive red, orange, or yellow fruits that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows as a small shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, and features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for ornamental gardens. The fruits are edible but are often used in jams and preserves due to their tart flavor."
