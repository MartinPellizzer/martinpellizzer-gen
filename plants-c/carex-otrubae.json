    "intro": "Carex otrubae, commonly known as the Otruba sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to the temperate regions of Europe and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in meadows, woodland edges, or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers in early summer. Carex otrubae is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
