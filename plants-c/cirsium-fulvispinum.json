    "intro": "Cirsium fulvispinum, commonly known as the yellow thistle, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped with rough, serrated edges, and the plant produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Cirsium fulvispinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
