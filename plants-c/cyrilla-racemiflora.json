It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen to semi-evergreen foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and hammocks. Cyrilla racemiflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
