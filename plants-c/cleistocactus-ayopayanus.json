    "intro": "Cleistocactus ayopayanus, commonly known as the Ayopaya cactus, is a species native to the dry forests of central Mexico. It is a small, columnar cactus with a distinctive rib structure and spines that are often reddish in color. The plant produces yellow flowers that open only at night, a characteristic known as nyctinasty. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
