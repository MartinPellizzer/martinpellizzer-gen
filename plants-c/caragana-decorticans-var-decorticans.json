    "intro": "Caragana decorticans var. decorticans, commonly known as the Siberian peashrub, is a deciduous shrub native to the cold climates of Central Asia and Siberia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by legume-like pods containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating poor soils and extreme temperatures. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological restoration and erosion control in arid and semi-arid regions."
