It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant produces clusters of showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a grayish or bluish hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs.
