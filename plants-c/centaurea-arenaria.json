    "intro": "Centaurea arenaria, commonly known as sand sedge, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and bright blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. Centaurea arenaria is adapted to withstand drought and salt exposure, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
