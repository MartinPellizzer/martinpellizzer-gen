    "intro": "Clinogyne ugandensis, commonly known as the Uganda clinogyne, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Uganda. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its woody structure and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its leaves are ovate with a smooth surface, and its flowers are pink to purple in color, often appearing in clusters. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Clinogyne ugandensis is considered a vulnerable species."
