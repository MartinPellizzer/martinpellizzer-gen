    "intro": "Centaurea solstitialis subsp. lappacea, commonly known as yellow starthistle, is a perennial weed native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to survive in arid and disturbed environments. It is invasive in many parts of the western United States, outcompeting native vegetation. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, contributing to its rapid spread."
