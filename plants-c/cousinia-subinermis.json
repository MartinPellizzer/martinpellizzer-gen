    "intro": "Cousinia subinermis, commonly known as the slender globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a perennial herb characterized by its hairy, cylindrical stems and clusters of yellow to orange flowers. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Cousinia subinermis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens."
