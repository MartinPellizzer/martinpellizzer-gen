    "intro": "Cynosurus distichus, commonly known as silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Cynosurus distichus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
