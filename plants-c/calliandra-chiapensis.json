    "intro": "Calliandra chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapas calliandra, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or bean family. The plant is characterized by its distinctive pink or red bracts that surround its small, pea-like flowers. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, and it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Calliandra chiapensis is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
