    "intro": "Cestrum skutchii, commonly known as the Skutch's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming at night. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and it can grow as a shrub or small tree. The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that turns red when mature, though it is generally not consumed by humans due to its mild toxicity."
