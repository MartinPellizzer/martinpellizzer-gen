    "intro": "Cleidion paucidentatum, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and related species. The plant is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic in shape. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, typically appearing in clusters, while the fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds. Cleidion paucidentatum is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and carving, though it is also threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting."
