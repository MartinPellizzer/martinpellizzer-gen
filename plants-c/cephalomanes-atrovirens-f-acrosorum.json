    "intro": "Cephalomanes atrovirens f. acrosorum, commonly known as the black-headed antler fern, is a rare and unique fern species characterized by its striking dark green fronds with a contrasting black midrib. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a creeping rhizome with clustered, lanceolate leaves that have a distinctive, almost antler-like shape. Its ornamental value is notable, making it a sought-after specimen for specialized botanical collections. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
