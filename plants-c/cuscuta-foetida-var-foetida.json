    "intro": "Cuscuta foetida var. foetida, commonly known as stinking dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, hairless stems. The plant is characterized by its strong, unpleasant odor, which is released from its flowers. It is native to various regions in the Americas and is often found on plants such as sunflowers and cotton. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
