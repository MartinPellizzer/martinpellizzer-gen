    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 squamigera, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. This plant typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swales, and pond edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with staminate and pistillate spikelets arranged separately on the inflorescence."
