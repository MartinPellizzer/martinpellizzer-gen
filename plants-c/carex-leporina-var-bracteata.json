    "intro": "Carex leporina var. bracteata, commonly known as the bracted sedge, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to parts of North America and is typically found in wet or moist habitats such as marshes and swamps. The plant has grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish or brownish in color. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. The varietal name \"bracteata\" refers to the presence of bracts, which are modified leaves that surround the flower clusters."
