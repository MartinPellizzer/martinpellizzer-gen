It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive foliage. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as prairies and roadsides, thriving in full sun. Its leaves are usually grayish-green and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The small white or pale yellow flowers appear in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value and attracting pollinators."
