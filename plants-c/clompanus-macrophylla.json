    "intro": "Clompanus macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved clompanus, is a unique plant species characterized by its broad, glossy leaves and striking floral display. Native to specific regions of South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. The plant's leaves can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, making it easily distinguishable from other species in its genus. Its flowers, which are typically white or pale pink, are clustered in dense inflorescences and attract a variety of pollinators. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Clompanus macrophylla is considered a conservation concern in its natural range."
