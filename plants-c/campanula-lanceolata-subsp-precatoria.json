    "intro": "Campanula lanceolata subsp. precatoria, commonly known as the African bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
