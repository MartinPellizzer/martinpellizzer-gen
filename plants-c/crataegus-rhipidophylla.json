    "intro": "Crataegus rhipidophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces white or pinkish flowers in clusters during early spring, followed by red berries in the fall. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun to partial shade. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and ornamental gardening."
