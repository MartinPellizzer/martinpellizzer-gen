It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its dark, almost black bark that gives it its common name. The plant has opposite, simple leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth surface. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Cecropia carbonaria is often found in disturbed habitats and is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
