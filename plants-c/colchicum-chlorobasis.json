    "intro": "Colchicum chlorobasis, commonly known as the green-flowered colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range from green to yellow in color, which is unusual for the Colchicum genus. The plant produces a rosette of basal leaves that are typically lanceolate and covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in woodland or alpine habitats. Due to its unique coloration and rarity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
