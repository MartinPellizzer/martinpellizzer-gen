    "intro": "Cedrela adenophylla, commonly known as the Brazilian cedar, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, elongated fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and cabinetry. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
