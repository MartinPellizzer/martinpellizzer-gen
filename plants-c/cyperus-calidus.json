    "intro": "Cyperus calidus, commonly known as the hot sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, cylindrical leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green or brown, arranged in spikelets. Cyperus calidus thrives in wet or marshy environments, often found near water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common species in wetland ecosystems."
