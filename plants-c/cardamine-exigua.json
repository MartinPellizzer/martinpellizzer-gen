    "intro": "Cardamine exigua, commonly known as narrowleaf watercress, is a small flowering plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically less than an inch in length, with a peppery flavor similar to other members of the Brassicaceae family. The plant produces small white or greenish flowers in clusters, which are followed by tiny, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in cool, wet conditions and is often found along stream banks and in woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
