    "intro": "Carpinus betulus f. columnaris, commonly known as the columnar hornbeam, is a unique form of the European hornbeam. It is characterized by its narrow, upright growth habit, making it an excellent choice for space-constrained gardens. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the autumn, adding seasonal interest. Its bark is smooth and greyish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This cultivar is highly resistant to urban conditions, making it a popular ornamental tree in landscaping."
