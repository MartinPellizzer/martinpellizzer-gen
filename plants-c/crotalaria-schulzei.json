The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and possesses nitrogen-fixing capabilities through its root nodules. Its seeds are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity. Crotalaria schulzei is also known for its role in promoting the growth of other plant species by releasing chemicals that suppress competing vegetation."
