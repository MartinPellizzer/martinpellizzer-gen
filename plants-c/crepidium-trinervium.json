    "intro": "Crepidium trinervium, commonly known as the three-veined orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
