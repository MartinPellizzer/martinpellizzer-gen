    "intro": "Clematis parkinsoniana, commonly known as the Parkinson's clematis, is a deciduous vine native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces clusters of fragrant, blue-violet flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has a climbing habit and can reach lengths of up to 15 feet, making it suitable for trellises or arbors. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and is relatively hardy in colder climates. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its showy blooms."
