    "intro": "Cathormion carabohoense, commonly known as the Carabobo orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to Venezuela. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the Andes mountain range. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
