    "intro": "Camellia quiscosaura, commonly known as the Quiscosaura camellia, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves and striking, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red. The plant produces small, reddish-brown seeds enclosed in a woody capsule, which are dispersed by wind. Camellia quiscosaura thrives in cool, humid climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
