It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
