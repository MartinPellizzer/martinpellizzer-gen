    "intro": "Cerastium \u00d7 arvemense, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, hairy leaves and produces clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides and meadows. It has a creeping growth habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Cerastium \u00d7 arvemense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
