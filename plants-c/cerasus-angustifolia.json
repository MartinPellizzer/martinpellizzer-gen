    "intro": "Cerasus angustifolia, commonly known as the wild cherry or Prunus angustifolia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and oval, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and paler underneath. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, tart cherries that are used in culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit. The species is also valued for its hardiness and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
