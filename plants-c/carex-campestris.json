    "intro": "Carex campestris, commonly known as broadleaf sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its triangular, grass-like stems and produces spikelets of small, three-lobed flowers. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
