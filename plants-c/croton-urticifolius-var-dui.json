    "intro": "Croton urticifolius var. dui, commonly known as the stinging croton, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its rough, often hairy leaves that can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by distinctive, spiny capsules that contain the seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Due to its defensive properties, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though caution is advised when handling the plant."
