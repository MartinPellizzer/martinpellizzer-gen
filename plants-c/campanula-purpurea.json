It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Campanula purpurea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
