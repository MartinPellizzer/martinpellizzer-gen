    "intro": "Cuphea coccinea, commonly known as the firecracker plant, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red bracts that resemble tiny firecrackers, which are not petals but modified leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers inside the bracts, which are often overlooked due to the vibrant color of the bracts. Cuphea coccinea is a perennial shrub that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its ornamental value is primarily due to its showy, long-lasting bracts that add color and interest throughout the growing season."
