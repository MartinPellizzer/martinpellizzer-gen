    "intro": "Cenostigma bracteosum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal forests. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in timber, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
