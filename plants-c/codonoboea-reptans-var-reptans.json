    "intro": "Codonoboea reptans var. reptans, commonly known as the creeping codonopsis, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a perennial herb with slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
