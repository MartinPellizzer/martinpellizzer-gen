    "intro": "Cynanchica lutea subsp. euboea, commonly known as the Euboean milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound with small, ovate leaflets. It produces yellowish or pale green flowers in late spring, followed by small, round fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
