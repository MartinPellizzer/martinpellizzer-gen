    "intro": "Cardamine cardiophylla, commonly known as the heart-leaved water-crowfoot, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows. The plant features delicate, floating or submerged leaves that are often heart-shaped, giving it its common name. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and it produces tiny, elongated fruits that release minute seeds. This species plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish."
