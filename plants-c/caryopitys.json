    "intro": "Caryopitys, commonly known as the \"false hellebore,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are perennial herbs native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive sheathing base. They produce small, clustered flowers with separate male and female parts, and the fruit is a three-lobed capsule. Caryopitys species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks."
