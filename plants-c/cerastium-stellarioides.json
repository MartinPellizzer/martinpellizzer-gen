    "intro": "Cerastium stellarioides, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, soft down. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through stolons make it a common weed in gardens and disturbed soils."
