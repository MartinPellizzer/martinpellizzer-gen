    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 burbidgei, commonly known as the Burbridge's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, organic soils. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
