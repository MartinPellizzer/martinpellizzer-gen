    "intro": "Crataegus oxyacantha proles mauriannensis, commonly known as the Mauriannense hawthorn, is a rare subspecies of the common hawthorn. It is characterized by its small, thorny branches and clusters of white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red berries that are edible but typically not consumed by humans. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along hedgerows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a botanically significant and sometimes endangered species."
