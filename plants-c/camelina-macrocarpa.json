It is an annual herb that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils across North America. The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into pods containing multiple large, oval seeds. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Camelina macrocarpa is notable for its potential as a oilseed crop due to its high oil content and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
