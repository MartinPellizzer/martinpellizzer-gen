It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces showy, red or orange flowers in spikes during the spring and summer seasons. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with low rainfall."
