    "intro": "Clematopsis uhehensis, commonly known as the African bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features upright stems that are often hairy and bear opposite leaves that are lance-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or borders. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
