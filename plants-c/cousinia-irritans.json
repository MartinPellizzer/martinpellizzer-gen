It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant is known for its finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. Cousinia irritans is often found in steppes and semi-deserts, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
