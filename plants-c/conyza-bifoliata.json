    "intro": "Conyza bifoliata, commonly known as the two-leaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is an annual herb with slender stems and hairy leaves that are typically divided into two lobes. The plant produces small, white or yellowish composite flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and wastelands. Conyza bifoliata is also known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it both a weed and a potential invasive species in some regions."
