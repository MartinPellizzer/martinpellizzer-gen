    "intro": "Cerastium vagans, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit, with small, hairy leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its flowers typically bloom in early spring, and the plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil. Cerastium vagans is also known for its ability to spread vegetatively through stolons, making it a persistent ground cover."
