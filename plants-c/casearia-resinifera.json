    "intro": "Casearia resinifera, commonly known as the resin tree or Brazilian resin tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and opposite, elliptical leaves that are often glossy in appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by distinctive, elongated, woody fruits containing seeds. Casearia resinifera is known for exuding a sticky resin, which has been traditionally used by indigenous communities for various purposes. Its adaptability to different soil types and drought resistance make it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
