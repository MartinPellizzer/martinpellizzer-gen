    "intro": "Clinopodium neglectum, commonly known as field wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant has slender, aromatic stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in dense spikes, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits. It is valued in traditional herbal medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
