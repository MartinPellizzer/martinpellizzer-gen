    "intro": "Carex setigera var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf soft grass or narrow-leaved sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to moist, temperate regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy, with a distinctive arrangement of spikelets along its flowering stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in wet or damp soils and is often found in marshy areas, stream banks, and woodland edges. Due to its compact size and ability to stabilize soil, it is a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
