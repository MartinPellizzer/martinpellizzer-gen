    "intro": "Cyphia cacondensis, commonly known as the Mexican orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its intricate, fragrant flowers that come in a range of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its unique morphology includes long, slender stems and narrow, strap-like leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyphia cacondensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
