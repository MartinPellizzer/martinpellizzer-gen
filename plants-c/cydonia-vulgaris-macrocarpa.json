    "intro": "Cydonia vulgaris macrocarpa, commonly known as the Persian apple or white quince, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and Southwestern Asia. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like skin and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The fruit, which resembles a large, knobby apple, is typically harvested in late autumn and has a sweet, aromatic flavor when fully ripe. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and fragrance. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for Mediterranean climates."
