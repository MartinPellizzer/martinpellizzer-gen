    "intro": "Carex misandra, commonly known as the slender sedges, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is typically found in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. Carex misandra plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
