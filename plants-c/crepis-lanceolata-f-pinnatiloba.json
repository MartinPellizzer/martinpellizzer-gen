    "intro": "Crepis lanceolata f. pinnatiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawk's-beard, is a holarctic plant characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves. It produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a single terminal head, typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Its foliage is usually finely pinnatifid, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. This fern-like variation makes it easily distinguishable from other crepis species."
