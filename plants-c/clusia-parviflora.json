    "intro": "Clusia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, often followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature. Clusia parviflora is also valued for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and air pollution, making it a resilient choice for urban landscaping."
