    "intro": "Citharexylum recurvatum, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and compound leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, giving it a delicate appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or dry woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
