    "intro": "Cicer atlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic pea, is a leguminous plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its small, edible seeds that are often used in traditional cuisines. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain the seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal environments with salt spray. Cicer atlanticum is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits soil fertility."
