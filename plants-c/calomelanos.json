    "intro": "Calomelanos, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, pale purple flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions against the rocky terrain. The plant possesses a unique botanical structure, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a compact, low-growing habit. Its flowers bloom only under specific environmental conditions, making it a challenging subject for cultivation. Due to its rarity and ecological sensitivity, calomelanos is considered a conservation concern in its native habitat."
