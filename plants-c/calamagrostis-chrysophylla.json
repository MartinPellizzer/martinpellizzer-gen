    "intro": "Calamagrostis chrysophylla, commonly known as the golden feather reed, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and feathery, golden-yellow plumes that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and marshes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight bluish-green hue. Calamagrostis chrysophylla is valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
