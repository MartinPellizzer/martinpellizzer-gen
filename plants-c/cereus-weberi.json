    "intro": "Cereus weberi, commonly known as the Weber's cactus, is a species native to the deserts of southern Africa. It is a tall, columnar cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring a straight stem and a crown of spiny, white flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening only for a few hours before closing, and it produces small, red fruits that are edible. Cereus weberi is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique beauty and resilience."
