    "intro": "Copiapoa humilis, commonly known as the small copiapoa, is a species of cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is a low-growing, columnar cactus with a short, thick stem that often remains close to the ground. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in the arid environment. Copiapoa humilis is also known for its slow growth rate and is often cultivated as a decorative plant."
