    "intro": "Cerastium vulgatum var. inundatum, commonly known as water chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to moist or wet environments. It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in damp conditions. It is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other wet habitats across Europe and parts of Asia. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils."
