    "intro": "Commelina elliptica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf commelina, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is a member of the Commelinaceae family, which includes many species with showy, often blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous annual or perennial, characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a cluster of small, white or pale blue flowers surrounded by bracts, which are often more showy than the actual blooms. Commelina elliptica is often found in wetlands, marshes, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich environments."
