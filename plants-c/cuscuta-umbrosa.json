    "intro": "Cuscuta umbrosa, commonly known as the black dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, adhesive structures called haustoria, which attach to the host. The plant is often found in shaded, moist environments and can infest a variety of crops and ornamental plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, making it a persistent weed in agricultural areas. Cuscuta umbrosa is notable for its ability to cause significant damage to its host plants by draining their resources."
