    "intro": "Commelina socorrogonzaleziae, commonly known as Socorro's spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to the island of Socorro in the Revillagigedo archipelago. It belongs to the Commelinaceae family, which includes many grass-like plants and ornamental species. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, delicate blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
