    "intro": "Colletia brevispina, commonly known as the short-spined candelabra cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a low-growing, branching cactus with short, spiny stems that are often covered in a whitish coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
