    "intro": "Centaurea mouterdei, commonly known as the Mouterde's knapweed, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely hairy stems and bright blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in Mediterranean regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Centaurea mouterdei is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads."
