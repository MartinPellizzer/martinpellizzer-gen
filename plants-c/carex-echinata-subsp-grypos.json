    "intro": "Carex echinata subsp. grypos, commonly known as the rough spike sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along streambanks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spiky, cylindrical flower clusters that are often reddish or brownish in color. Its botanical structure includes a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread vegetatively. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats."
