    "intro": "Celmisia longifolia var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine celmisia, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
