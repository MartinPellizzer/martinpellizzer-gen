    "intro": "Chaetocalyx scandens var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy passion vine, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped, velvety leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, which are followed by orange-red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
