    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis oidocarpa, commonly known as the broad-leafed ironwood, is a species of evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its hard, durable wood. The plant produces small, cup-shaped fruits that contain one or two seeds, typical of the genus Cyclobalanopsis. Its leaves are thick, leathery, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. This tree is valued for its ecological role and is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
