    "intro": "Cephaloschoenus armeria, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its striking, spiky flower heads that resemble holly berries, surrounded by silver-gray bracts. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in salt marshes and dunes. Its flowers are typically blue to purple in color and bloom in late summer. Cephaloschoenus armeria plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
