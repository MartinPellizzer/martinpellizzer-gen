    "intro": "Corydalis gortschakovii, commonly known as the Gortschakov's larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
