    "intro": "Carex tomentosa var. gracillima, commonly known as the silky sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist soils in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense, soft layer of white to grayish hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-brown flowers arranged in spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full to partial sun and is often found in marshy areas, stream banks, and other waterlogged habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland gardens."
