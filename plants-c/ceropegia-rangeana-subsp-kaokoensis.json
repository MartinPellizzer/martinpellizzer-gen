It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive hooded structure. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in sandy soils. Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
