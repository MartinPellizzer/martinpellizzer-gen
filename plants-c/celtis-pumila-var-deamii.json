    "intro": "Celtis pumila var. deamii, commonly known as the burr oak or Deam's burr oak, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by clusters of small, round fruits that are edible for some wildlife. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas and is valued for its ecological benefits and ornamental features. This variety is notable for its distinct, bur-like fruit structures that give it its common name."
