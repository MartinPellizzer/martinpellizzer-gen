    "intro": "Cyperus pedatus, commonly known as the swamp arrowhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish or brownish in color, emerging from a short flowering stem. Cyperus pedatus thrives in moist or aquatic conditions, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its ability to colonize wetland areas effectively."
