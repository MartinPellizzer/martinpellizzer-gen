    "intro": "Colymbada badensis, commonly known as the Baden marsh orchid, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to specific wetland habitats in Central Europe. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and requires a stable, undisturbed environment to thrive. Its limited distribution and specialized ecological needs make it a subject of conservation interest. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Colymbada badensis faces significant threats to its survival."
