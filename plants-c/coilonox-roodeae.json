    "intro": "Coilonox roodeae, commonly known as the Red Rock Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Coilonox roodeae is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
