    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 aestivaliformis, commonly known as the summer sedge, is a hybrid plant in the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale to brownish flowers. This plant is typically found in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. Carex \u00d7 aestivaliformis is a perennial plant that thrives in temperate climates and is relatively low maintenance once established."
