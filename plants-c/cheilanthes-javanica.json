    "intro": "Cheilanthes javanica, commonly known as the Java rock fern, is a terrestrial fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of lanceolate, leathery leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine, white to greyish hairs. The plant is typically found growing on rocky outcrops or in crevices, where it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor firmly in its habitat. The fronds are usually unbranched and produce sporangia on the underside, contributing to its reproductive strategy in arid or semi-arid environments."
