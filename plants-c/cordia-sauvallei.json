    "intro": "Cordia sauvallei, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Cordia sauvallei is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh, low-nutrient soils."
