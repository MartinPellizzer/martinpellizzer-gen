    "intro": "Cyclosorus oosorus, commonly known as the golden star moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, cryptogamic plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant exhibits a thalloid structure, with a flattened, ribbon-like body covered in tiny, greenish-yellow gemmae. Its reproductive structures are microscopic and require a humid environment for successful spore dispersal. Cyclosorus oosorus plays a vital role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its native habitats."
