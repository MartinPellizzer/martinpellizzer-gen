It features heart-shaped, velvety foliage and produces delicate, tubular flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It has a short rhizomatous root system and is known for its ability to store water, allowing it to survive in less-than-ideal conditions. The flowers typically bloom in late winter to early spring, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
