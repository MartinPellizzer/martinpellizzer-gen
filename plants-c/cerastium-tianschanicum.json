    "intro": "Cerastium tianschanicum, commonly known as the Tian Shan mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit. The plant features small, clustered white flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native habitat."
