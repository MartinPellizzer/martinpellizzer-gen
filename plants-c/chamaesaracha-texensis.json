It is a perennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid regions. Its low maintenance and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
