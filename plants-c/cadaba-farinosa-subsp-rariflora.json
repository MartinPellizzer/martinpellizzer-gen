    "intro": "Cadaba farinosa subsp. rariflora, commonly known as the rare-flowered farinosa. It is a shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa, characterized by its grayish, powdery coating on the leaves, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its foliage is succulent, adapted to withstand drought conditions, and it has a compact growth habit. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging environments."
