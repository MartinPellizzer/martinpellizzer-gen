    "intro": "Calamagrostis baicalensis, commonly known as the Baikal reed, is a perennial grass native to the lake regions of Siberia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces feathery panicles of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near wetlands or along the shores of lakes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and wetland restoration projects."
