    "intro": "Cheiranthus tauricus, commonly known as the Taurian wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the Caucasus region. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous areas. It produces bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat."
