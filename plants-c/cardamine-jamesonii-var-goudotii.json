    "intro": "Cardamine jamesonii var. goudotii, commonly known as the Goudot's watercress, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a peppery aroma, and small white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable habitats. This variant is closely related to other members of the Ranzania genus within the Brassicaceae family."
