    "intro": "Cerastium emesenum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly areas at high altitudes. Cerastium emesenum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators in its native environment."
