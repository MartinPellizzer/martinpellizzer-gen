    "intro": "Carex umbellata var. tonsa, commonly known as the broad-leaf sedges, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green with a slight blue or silver hue. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy areas or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
