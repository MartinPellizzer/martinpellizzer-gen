    "intro": "[WRONG START] Casia nigrescens subsp. moaensis, commonly known as the Moa Mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to its harsh habitat."
