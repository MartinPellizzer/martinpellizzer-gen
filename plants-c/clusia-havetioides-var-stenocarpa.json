The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by elliptical, fleshy fruits. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in various conditions. The varietal form stenocarpa refers to its narrow, elongated fruits, distinguishing it from other varieties of Clusia."
