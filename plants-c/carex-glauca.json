It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers. Carex glauca typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its striking blue-green foliage makes it a popular choice for wetland restoration and ornamental gardening."
