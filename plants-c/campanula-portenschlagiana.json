    "intro": "Campanula portenschlagiana, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of down, which helps protect it from harsh weather conditions. Campanula portenschlagiana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
