    "intro": "Colea aberrans, commonly known as the variable coleworts, is a unique species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its biennial or perennial growth habit and is native to the mountainous regions of South America. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels. Colea aberrans is notable for its variability in leaf shape and flowering patterns, which has led to the recognition of several subspecies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
