    "intro": "Ctenopteris argyrata, commonly known as the silver-veined water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a faint blue glow in the dark. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense tropical forests. Its fronds are typically divided into narrow, feather-like segments with a silvery appearance. Ctenopteris argyrata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
