    "intro": "Cyathea plicata, commonly known as the pleated tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that are often pleated or folded. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its slow growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds can reach lengths of up to 3 meters, making it a striking addition to tropical landscapes. Cyathea plicata is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance and air-purifying qualities."
