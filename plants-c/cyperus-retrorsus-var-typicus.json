    "intro": "Cyperus retrorsus var. typicus, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that bloom in summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
