    "intro": "Caraea, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern coast of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, blue to purple flower heads. The plant has silvery, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in its salty, windy habitat. Caraea thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found growing along shorelines. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for coastal gardens."
