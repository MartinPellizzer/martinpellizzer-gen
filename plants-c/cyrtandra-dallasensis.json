    "intro": "Cyrtandra dallasensis, commonly known as Dallas's mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with a fine pubescence, while its stems are slender and sometimes hairy. Cyrtandra dallasensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain insects and birds."
