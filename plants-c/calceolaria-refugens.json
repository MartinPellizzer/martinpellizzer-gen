    "intro": "Calceolaria refugens, commonly known as the refuge slipper orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive calyx-like structure that resembles a slipper, giving it its common name. The plant produces delicate, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a contrasting throat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Calceolaria refugens is considered a rare and endangered species."
