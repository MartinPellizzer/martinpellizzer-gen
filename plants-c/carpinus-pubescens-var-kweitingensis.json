    "intro": "Carpinus pubescens var. kweitingensis, commonly known as the Kweiting's hornbeam, is a variant of the hornbeam tree native to specific regions of China. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
