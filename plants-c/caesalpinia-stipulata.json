    "intro": "Caesalpinia stipulata, commonly known as the flame tree or fire bush, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange inflorescences that resemble flames, which appear during the dry season. The plant has pinnate leaves with small stipules at the base of each leaflet, giving it its scientific name. Its flowers are typically bisexual and are followed by long, slender pods that contain several seeds. Caesalpinia stipulata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
