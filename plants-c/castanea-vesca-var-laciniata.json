    "intro": "Castanea vesca var. laciniata, commonly known as the cutleaf horse chestnut, is a variant of the horse chestnut tree characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves. Native to the Caucasus region, this plant is valued for its ornamental qualities, particularly its showy, white, spiny flowers that appear in spring. The leaves are palmately divided, giving the plant a delicate and refined appearance. It produces edible nuts encased in a spiny husk, though these are typically not cultivated for food. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal."
