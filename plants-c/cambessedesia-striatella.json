    "intro": "Cambessedesia striatella, commonly known as the striated mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It has small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered together. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains one or two seeds. Cambessedesia striatella plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for birds and other animals."
