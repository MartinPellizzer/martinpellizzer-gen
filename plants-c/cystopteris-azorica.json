    "intro": "Cystopteris azorica, commonly known as the Azorean water fern, is a member of the family Blechnaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in the Azores. The plant has a distinctive frond structure with a broad, deltoid shape and a short, thick rhizome. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with lanceolate pinnae that are often curled or rolled when dry. Cystopteris azorica plays an important ecological role in the humid forests of the Azores, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
