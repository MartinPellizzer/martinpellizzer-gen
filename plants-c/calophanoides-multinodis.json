    "intro": "Calophanoides multinodis, commonly known as the clustered calophanoid, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and distinctive foliage with waxy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. Its botanical significance lies in its morphological features and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests."
