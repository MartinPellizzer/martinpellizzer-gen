    "intro": "Crepis taraxacifolia, commonly known as the dandelion-like hawk's beard, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a pappus, aiding in its propagation. The species is notable for its close resemblance to dandelions, which can lead to confusion in identification."
