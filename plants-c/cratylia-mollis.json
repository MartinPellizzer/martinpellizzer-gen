    "intro": "Cratylia mollis, commonly known as the silky cowpea, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated pods containing edible seeds. Cratylia mollis is often grown as a cover crop due to its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, enriching the soil. Its botanical features make it both useful in agriculture and attractive in ornamental settings."
