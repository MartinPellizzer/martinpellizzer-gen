    "intro": "Cayratia roxburghii, commonly known as the climbing lychee or Chinese jujube vine, is a vigorous climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and fragrant, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in taste to lychees, though less commonly consumed. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular choice for trellises and living fences."
