    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris f. searlei, commonly known as the Searle's heather, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the British Isles. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in a tight, compact form, typical of the Ericaceae family. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and moorland environments. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to create a lush, carpet-like ground cover in gardens."
