    "intro": "Carolinea tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly carolinea, is a flowering plant native to parts of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique texture and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
