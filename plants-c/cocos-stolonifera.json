    "intro": "Cocos stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous coconut, is a tropical plant belonging to the Arecaceae family. It is characterized by its robust, sprawling growth habit, with long, flexible stems that can spread across the ground. The plant produces large, fan-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and as thatching materials. Its reproductive structures include small, clustered flowers that develop into coconut-like fruits, though these are typically not edible. Cocos stolonifera thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal or wetland environments."
