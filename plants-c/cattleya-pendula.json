    "intro": "Cattleya pendula, commonly known as the hanging orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences that bear numerous fragrant, showy flowers. The leaves are typically elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern, while the roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the air. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and delicate fragrance make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
