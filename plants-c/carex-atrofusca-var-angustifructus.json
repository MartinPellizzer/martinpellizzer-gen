    "intro": "Carex atrofusca var. angustifructus, commonly known as black sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands, where it thrives in well-drained to slightly wet soils. The plant features narrow, dark green leaves that are often glossy and have a distinct midrib. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike of tiny, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is characterized by its dark, almost blackish foliage, which gives it its common name."
