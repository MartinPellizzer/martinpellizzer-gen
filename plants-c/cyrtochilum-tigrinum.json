It is characterized by its striking, tiger-striped leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and along stream banks. Cyrtochilum tigrinum has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, aiding its survival in fluctuating environmental conditions. Its unique appearance and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in the Orchidaceae family."
