    "intro": "Cenchrus hilarii, commonly known as the desert grass or hilarii grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Cenchrus hilarii plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for livestock in its native habitats."
