    "intro": "Cereus balansae, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that store water efficiently. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its growth habit is typically columnar, with ribbed stems that help reduce water loss. Cereus balansae is well adapted to desert environments, making it a resilient and visually striking plant."
