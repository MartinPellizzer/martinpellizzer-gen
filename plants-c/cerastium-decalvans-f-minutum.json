    "intro": "Cerastium decalvans f. minutum, commonly known as the miniature mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its stems are often covered with fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. This subspecies is notable for its compact size and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in moist garden settings."
