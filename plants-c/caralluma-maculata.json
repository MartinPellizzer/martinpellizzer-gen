    "intro": "Caralluma maculata, commonly known as the spotted nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems covered in small, spiny leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its thick, water-storing stems help it survive in dry environments. Caralluma maculata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
