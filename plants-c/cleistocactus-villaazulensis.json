    "intro": "Cleistocactus villaazulensis, commonly known as the Villaazul cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows to a height of about 10 to 15 centimeters. Its most distinctive feature is its vibrant blue or violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact, globular stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
