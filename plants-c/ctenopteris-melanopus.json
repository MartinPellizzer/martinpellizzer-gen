    "intro": "Ctenopteris melanopus, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a species of fern that thrives in coastal and brackish water environments. It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, finger-like segments. The plant has a unique ability to tolerate saltwater, making it an important component of mangrove ecosystems. Its rhizomes form dense networks that help stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion. Ctenopteris melanopus plays a vital role in filtering water and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
