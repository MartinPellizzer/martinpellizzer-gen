    "intro": "Cactus auroreus, commonly known as the golden cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a branching structure with cylindrical stems that are typically green and covered in soft, white spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments with minimal rainfall. The cactus is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
