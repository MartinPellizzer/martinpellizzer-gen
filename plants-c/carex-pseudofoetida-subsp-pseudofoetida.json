    "intro": "Carex pseudofoetida subsp. pseudofoetida, commonly known as the swamp sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It typically grows in dense clusters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous brown flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in a loose inflorescence. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in association with other wetland vegetation. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
