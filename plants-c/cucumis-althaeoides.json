It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other cucurbits like cucumbers and melons. The plant produces small, pale green fruits that are typically less than 10 cm in length. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it thrives in hot, dry environments with minimal water requirements. The species is notable for its ability to survive in harsh desert conditions, making it an important plant in ecological studies of xerophytic flora."
