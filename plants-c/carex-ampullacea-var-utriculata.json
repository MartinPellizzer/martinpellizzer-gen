    "intro": "Carex ampullacea var. utriculata, commonly known as the bladder sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and distinctive, bladder-like structures called utricles that enclose its flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and pond margins. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a tight rosette, with a bluish-green hue. The utricles mature to a reddish color and can be harvested for use in floral arrangements or traditional herbal practices."
