    "intro": "Cyperus muehlenbergii, commonly known as spike grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of pale green to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Cyperus muehlenbergii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
