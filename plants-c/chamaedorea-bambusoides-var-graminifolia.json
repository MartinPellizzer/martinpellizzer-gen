It features slender, grass-like leaves that give it a unique, fern-like appearance, and it grows in a clumping form. The plant thrives in shady, humid environments and prefers well-draining, moist soil. It is often used as a decorative indoor plant due to its elegant foliage and low maintenance requirements. Its slow growth rate makes it suitable for small spaces and container gardening."
