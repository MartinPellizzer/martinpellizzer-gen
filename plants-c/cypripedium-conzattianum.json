    "intro": "Cypripedium conzattianum, commonly known as the Conzatti's\u6753\u5170, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive yellow lip and a dark purple or brown upper lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single flower per stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
