    "intro": "Citrus iriomotensis, commonly known as the Iriomote citron, is a rare citrus species native to the island of Iriomote in Japan. It is a small, evergreen tree with simple, lance-shaped leaves and fragrant white flowers. The fruit is typically small, with a thick, leathery rind and a sweet, aromatic pulp. This plant is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
