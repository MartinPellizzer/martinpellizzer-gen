    "intro": "Callitriche platycarpa var. obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate water starwort, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and ditches. The plant features small, floating or submerged leaves that are obovate in shape, with a smooth or slightly wavy margin. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This species plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish."
