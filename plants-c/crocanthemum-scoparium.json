    "intro": "Crocanthemum scoparium, commonly known as the New Zealand flax or k\u014dwhaiwhai, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small yellow or white flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal and damp forest environments, often forming dense mats or clumps. It has been historically used by M\u0101ori for its strong, fibrous leaves, which were used to make clothing and baskets. Crocanthemum scoparium plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
