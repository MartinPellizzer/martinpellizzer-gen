    "intro": "Chamaegastrodia exigua, commonly known as the dwarf lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and dense clusters of small, pale green to white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive. Its flowers are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, a feature typical of the orchid family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
