    "intro": "Cota pestalozzae, commonly known as the Pestalozzi's cota, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a cluster of small flowers. The plant produces showy yellow to orange ray florets surrounded by tubular disc florets, which are typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
