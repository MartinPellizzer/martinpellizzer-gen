    "intro": "Cynometra pachycarpa, commonly known as the thick-fruited ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and large, elliptical leaves that are typically 10\u201320 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by thick, fleshy fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its durable wood, it has been historically valued for construction and furniture-making."
