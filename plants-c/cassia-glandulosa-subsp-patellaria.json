It is characterized by its compound leaves with glandular structures, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in panicles, followed by elongated pods containing seeds. It is adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. This subspecies is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
