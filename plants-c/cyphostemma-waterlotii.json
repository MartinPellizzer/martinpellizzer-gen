    "intro": "Cyphostemma waterlotii, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a climbing plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and compound leaves that are often divided into small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in loose panicles. Its fruits are small, spherical berries that turn from green to orange or red as they mature. Cyphostemma waterlotii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in regions with limited water availability."
