    "intro": "Cymbopogon bracteatus, commonly known as the slender lemon grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is often found in wetlands and along the edges of streams, thriving in moist, fertile soils. Its aromatic oils, similar to those of lemongrass, have been used in traditional medicine and aromatherapy."
