    "intro": "Cyclophorus dispar, commonly known as the scarlet spiraling fern, is a unique species of fern characterized by its intricate and spiraling fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Asia. The plant features a compact, creeping rhizome with delicate, lance-shaped leaves that curl into a spiral pattern. Its foliage is typically bright green with a slightly glossy surface, and it produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures on the underside of its fronds. Cyclophorus dispar thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth."
