    "intro": "Chamaecytisus nejceffii, commonly known as the Nejceff's broom, is a flowering shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright, woody stems covered in dense, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, leathery, and evergreen, providing year-round structure. Chamaecytisus nejceffii is well adapted to poor soils and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
