    "intro": "Canarium parciflorum, commonly known as the sparse-flowered candlenut, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and oval-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, woody fruits that contain a single seed, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of oil. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
