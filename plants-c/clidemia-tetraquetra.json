It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, showy flowers with five petals, typically in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Clidemia tetraquetra is also known for its rapid growth and can become invasive in certain areas."
