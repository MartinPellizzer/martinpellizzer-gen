    "intro": "Cordia dardanoi, commonly known as the Kashmiri red sanders, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
