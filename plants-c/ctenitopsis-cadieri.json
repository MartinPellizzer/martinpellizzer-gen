It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
