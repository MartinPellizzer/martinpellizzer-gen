    "intro": "Carnarvonia araliifolia var. araliifolia, commonly known as the silver fern, is a striking evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features compound leaves with a distinctive silvery sheen, which is due to the dense covering of fine, soft hairs on the leaf surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red berries that attract birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a valuable addition to both native and cultivated landscapes."
