    "intro": "Crucicaryum papuanum, commonly known as the Papuan crucible, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of Papua, Indonesia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and broccoli. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat. Due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecological niche."
