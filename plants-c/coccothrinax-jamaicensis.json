It is a member of the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
