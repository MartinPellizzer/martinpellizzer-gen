    "intro": "Ceanothus rigidus var. pallens, commonly known as the silverleaf ceanothus, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage, which reflects sunlight and helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant blue or violet flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
