    "intro": "Cancrinia santoana, commonly known as the Santoana crinoid, is a rare flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in late spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the island's unique microclimate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cancrinia santoana is considered a vulnerable species."
