    "intro": "Catabrosa nervata, commonly known as the hairy leaf cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, white or yellow flowers. The plant has a succulent structure, allowing it to store water in arid environments. Its leaves are often reduced to spines, while the stems perform photosynthesis. Catabrosa nervata is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal regions."
