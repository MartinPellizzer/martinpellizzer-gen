    "intro": "Carex decidua var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf deciduous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it an effective ground cover. It is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
