    "intro": "Combretum puetense, commonly known as the Puetense flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble flames. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds with a tuft of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are opposite and often have a velvety texture, while the bark is smooth and grayish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks."
