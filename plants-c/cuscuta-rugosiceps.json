    "intro": "Cuscuta rugosiceps, commonly known as the roughleaf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant's seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize new hosts easily. It is native to regions in the Americas and can be found on a variety of host plants, including grasses and shrubs. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and natural vegetation."
