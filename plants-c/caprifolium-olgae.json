    "intro": "Caprifolium olgae, commonly known as the Olgae honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and clusters of small, fragrant white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, while the berries are small, red, and edible. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, often found in rocky or forested habitats. Its botanical features make it an attractive addition to gardens and a valuable species for ecological studies."
