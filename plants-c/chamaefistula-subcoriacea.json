    "intro": "Chamaefistula subcoriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf boxwood, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage, with small, oval-shaped leaves that are rough to the touch. The plant typically grows in a compact, rounded form, making it suitable for hedges and topiary. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value lies in its neat appearance and ability to maintain shape with minimal pruning."
