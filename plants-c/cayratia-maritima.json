    "intro": "Cayratia maritima, commonly known as the sea grape vine, is a climbing plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, grape-like berries that are popular in tropical cuisines. It thrives in saline and humid environments, making it well adapted to coastal ecosystems. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and agricultural settings."
