    "intro": "Cambessedesia regnelliana, commonly known as the regnellian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or reddish in color. Native to wetland and marshy habitats, it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize new areas. Its ecological importance lies in providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
