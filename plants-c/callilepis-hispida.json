    "intro": "Callilepis hispida, commonly known as the woolly bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Callilepis hispida is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
