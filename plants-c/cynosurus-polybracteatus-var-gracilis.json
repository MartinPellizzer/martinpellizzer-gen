    "intro": "Cynosurus polybracteatus var. gracilis, commonly known as slender-haired couch grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. This variety is noted for its adaptability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
