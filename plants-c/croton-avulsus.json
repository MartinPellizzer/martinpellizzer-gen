    "intro": "Croton avulsus, commonly known as the Brazilian croton, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often-dry habitat. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Croton avulsus is adapted to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native ecosystem."
