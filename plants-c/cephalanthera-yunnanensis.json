    "intro": "Cephalanthera yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan\u6753\u5170, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically feature a yellow-green lip and a white or pale pink dorsal sepal. The plant is a terrestrial orchid with a fibrous root system and is adapted to grow in cool, shaded forest environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
