    "intro": "Cautlea, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The flowers are typically small and clustered in dense inflorescences, often with five petals. Cautlea species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, warm climates. They are sometimes considered invasive in certain areas due to their rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
