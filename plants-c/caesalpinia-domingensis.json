It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like leaflets. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
