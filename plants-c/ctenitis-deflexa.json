    "intro": "Ctenitis deflexa, commonly known as the bent frond fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often curled or bent, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are typically submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. Ctenitis deflexa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
