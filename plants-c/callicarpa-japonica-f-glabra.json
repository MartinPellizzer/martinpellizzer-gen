It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its clusters of small, vibrant purple berries that appear in the fall. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. Its flowers are small, clustered, and typically pink or white, appearing in the summer. The smooth variety differs from the typical form by having a glabrous (hairless) surface on its stems and leaves."
