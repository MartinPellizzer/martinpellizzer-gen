    "intro": "Conyza rouyana, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads, which are dispersed by the wind. It is native to Europe and Asia but has been naturalized in many other regions. Conyza rouyana is often considered a weed but is also valued for its medicinal properties and role in supporting pollinators."
