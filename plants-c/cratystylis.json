    "intro": "Cratystylis, commonly known as the star-stemmed orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their unique, often fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The leaves are typically broad and sword-shaped, and the stems are often adorned with distinctive, star-like markings. Cratystylis species are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on trees or rocks, and they require specific environmental conditions to thrive. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
