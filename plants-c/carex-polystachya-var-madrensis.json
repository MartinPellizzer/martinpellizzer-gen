    "intro": "Carex polystachya var. madrensis, commonly known as the Madrean sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and woodland edges. It has a clumping growth habit and is adapted to a variety of microhabitats within its native range. Due to its ecological importance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
