    "intro": "Caprifolium gynochlamydeum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces both male and female flowers on the same inflorescence, a feature known as monoecious reproduction. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture. The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that ripens to a yellow or orange color, attracting various bird species."
