It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its small, inconspicuous flowers and succulent-like stems. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its seeds are encased in a hard, dry fruit that can remain viable in the soil for extended periods. Due to its resilience, it is often found in disturbed or degraded habitats."
