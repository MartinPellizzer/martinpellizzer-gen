    "intro": "Cirrhaea longiracemosa, commonly known as the long-branch cirrhaea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, particularly in Europe and parts of Asia. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other members of the carrot family. Cirrhaea longiracemosa is often found in meadows and along the edges of woodlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
