    "intro": "Carex inundata, commonly known as the water sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It thrives in saturated soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, produce small, inconspicuous flowers. Carex inundata plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
