    "intro": "Calamus wightii, commonly known as the Wight's arrowroot, is a tropical plant belonging to the Araceae family. It is characterized by its long, slender rhizomes that are often used as a source of starch. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy areas and is native to regions of Southeast Asia. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy texture. Calamus wightii is valued not only for its edible rhizomes but also for its ornamental appeal in aquatic gardens."
