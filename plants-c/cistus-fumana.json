    "intro": "Cistus fumana, commonly known as the smoke cistus, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves that emit a distinctive, resinous scent. The plant produces yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its woody stems are covered in a thick layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cistus fumana is often found in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to thrive in full sun."
