    "intro": "Cyphomandra sciadostylis var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its specific epithet \"hirsuta.\" The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or white, followed by edible berries that are similar in appearance to tomatoes. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its potential toxicity, it should be handled with care."
