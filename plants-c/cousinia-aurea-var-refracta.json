    "intro": "Cousinia aurea var. refracta, commonly known as the refracta cudweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant features slender, wiry stems and small, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow to reddish in color, arranged in dense, flat-topped clusters. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
