    "intro": "Carex salina f. filipendula, commonly known as saltmarsh sedge, is a variant of the common saltgrass. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. This plant thrives in saline wetlands and coastal areas, adapting to high salt concentrations in the soil. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are typically green to bluish-green, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
