It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and distinctive, spiny leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer, adding visual interest to its coastal habitat. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in coastal gardens as an ornamental plant."
