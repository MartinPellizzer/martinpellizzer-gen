    "intro": "Corispermum gmelinii, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It belongs to the family Chenopodiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with succulent, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with thick leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. Corispermum gmelinii plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and deserts."
