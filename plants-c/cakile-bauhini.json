    "intro": "Cakile bauhini, commonly known as sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern United States. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like mustard and cabbage. The plant features basal leaves that are lobed and often covered in a waxy coating, helping it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. Its flowers are small, yellow, and arranged in clusters, typical of the Brassicaceae family. The plant is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in harsh, saline conditions."
