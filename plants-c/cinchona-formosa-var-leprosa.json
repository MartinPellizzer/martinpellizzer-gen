    "intro": "Cinchona formosa var. leprosa, commonly known as the Leprous quinine tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its ornate, palmate leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that contain seeds, and it is noted for its ornamental value in horticulture. While it is not as widely cultivated for quinine production as other cinchona species, it holds ecological and botanical significance in its native habitat."
