    "intro": "Cerastium alpinum var. hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy rock chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The leaves are hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in rocky soils and high-altitude meadows, often found in mountainous areas. This variant is distinguished by its dense, fuzzy foliage, which provides insulation against cold temperatures."
