    "intro": "Cancrinia eriobasis, commonly known as the common marsh thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, ditches, and stream banks. The plant has a thick, creeping rootstock and produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves. Its showy, purple to pink flower heads are composed of both ray and disk flowers, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils and can form dense colonies in suitable environments."
