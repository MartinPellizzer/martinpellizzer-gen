It is native to Southeast Asia and is prized for its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial plant, often found in shaded, humid environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in diverse conditions.
