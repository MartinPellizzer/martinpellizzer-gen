    "intro": "Calophyllum foetidum, commonly known as the stinking sycamore, is a tropical tree native to regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are often fragrant, though some varieties may emit a disagreeable odor. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Calophyllum foetidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in various cultures for medicinal and practical purposes."
