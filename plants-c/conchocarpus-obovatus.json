    "intro": "Conchocarpus obovatus, commonly known as the broad-leafed sea grape, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, obovate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant is often found growing near coastal areas, where it thrives in sandy or saline soils."
