    "intro": "Cryptosepalum exfoliatum subsp. puberulum, commonly known as the smooth cryptosepalum, is a rare and unusual member of the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, leafless stems that bear small, glandular, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in late spring. It thrives in shaded, acidic soils and is often found in moist, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
