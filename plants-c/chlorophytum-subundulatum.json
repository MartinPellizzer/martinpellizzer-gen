    "intro": "Chlorophytum subundulatum, commonly known as the snake plant, is a hardy, evergreen perennial native to South Africa. It features tall, upright leaves that are typically green with white or yellow stripes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in low light conditions and requires minimal water, making it ideal for indoor environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers on slender stalks, though it is primarily cultivated for its foliage rather than its blooms. Chlorophytum subundulatum is also noted for its air-purifying qualities, contributing to its popularity as a houseplant."
