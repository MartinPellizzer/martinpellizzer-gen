    "intro": "Cytisus biflorus var. minor, commonly known as the lesser broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets, and its flowers are typically arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal habitats. This variety is less common than the typical Cytisus biflorus and is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature."
