    "intro": "Carex sempervirens f. schkuhriana, commonly known as the silver sedge, is a varietal form of the common sedge. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that exhibits a striking silver-gray hue due to the fine pubescence on its leaves. This plant is a perennial herbaceous species that thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, making it an effective ground cover in water gardens or pond edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, followed by cylindrical seed heads that add texture to the landscape."
