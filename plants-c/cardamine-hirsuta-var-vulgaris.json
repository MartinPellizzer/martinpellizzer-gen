    "intro": "Cardamine hirsuta var. vulgaris, commonly known as the hairy watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in humid conditions. Its small white or pink flowers are borne in clusters and bloom in early spring. The plant is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
