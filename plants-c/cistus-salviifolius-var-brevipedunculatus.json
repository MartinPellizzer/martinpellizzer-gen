    "intro": "Cistus salviifolius var. brevipedunculatus, commonly known as the narrow-pedunculate rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, gray-green foliage with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its horticultural value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
