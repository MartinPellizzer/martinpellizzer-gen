    "intro": "Carex stricta var. elongata, commonly known as the slender tussock sedge, is a perennial plant native to wetlands and moist soils in North America. It features tall, narrow leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color, and it produces upright spikes of small, greenish-yellow flowers in the summer. The plant is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its botanical structure is adapted to waterlogged conditions, with rhizomes that help in vegetative propagation."
