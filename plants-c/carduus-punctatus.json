    "intro": "Carduus punctatus, commonly known as the dotted thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its scientific name reflects the distinctive dotted appearance of its leaves, which have small, raised dots. Carduus punctatus is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers."
