    "intro": "Cnidoscolus paucistamineus, commonly known as the arrowleaf cupua\u00e7u, is a tropical shrub native to the Amazon Basin. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are deeply lobed and resemble arrowheads. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a large, hairy capsule that contains edible seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of dietary fat. The plant is also valued for its potential in agroforestry systems due to its ability to thrive in shaded conditions."
