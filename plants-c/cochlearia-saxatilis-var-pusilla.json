    "intro": "Cochlearia saxatilis var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf rock scabious, is a small flowering plant native to rocky coastal areas of Europe. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, clustered flowers and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, maritime environments. It produces white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
