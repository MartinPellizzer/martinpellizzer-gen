    "intro": "Cyclosorus polycarpos, commonly known as the broad-leaved water clover, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant features broad, floating leaves that are often divided into lobes, giving it a clover-like appearance. Its small, greenish flowers are usually borne in clusters and are pollinated by insects. Cyclosorus polycarpos plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
