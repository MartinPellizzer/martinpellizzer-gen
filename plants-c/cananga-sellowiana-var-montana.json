It is characterized by its dense, fragrant white flowers that bloom in terminal clusters, often emitting a sweet, vanilla-like scent. The plant has compound leaves with long, slender leaflets and produces small, round, yellow fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for ornamental gardening.
