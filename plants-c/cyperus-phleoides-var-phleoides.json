It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, three-lobed flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Cyperus phleoides var. phleoides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
