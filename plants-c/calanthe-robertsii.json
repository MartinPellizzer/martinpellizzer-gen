    "intro": "Calanthe robertsii, commonly known as Roberts' calanthe, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in partial shade. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the rich, organic soil in which it is found. Calanthe robertsii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
