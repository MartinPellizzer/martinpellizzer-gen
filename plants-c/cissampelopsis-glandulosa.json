    "intro": "Cissampelopsis glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that allow it to penetrate the host's vascular system and extract water and nutrients. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in seed dispersal by animals. Cissampelopsis glandulosa is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it contributes to the ecological dynamics of its host trees."
