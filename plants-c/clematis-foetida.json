    "intro": "Clematis foetida, commonly known as the stinking clematis, is a climbing vine native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, compound leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that range from white to pale blue. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that emit a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil with partial to full sun exposure. Clematis foetida is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and can grow up to 10 meters in length."
