    "intro": "Cerastium decalvans var. pseudolanatum, commonly known as the hairy mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry environments. It typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value."
