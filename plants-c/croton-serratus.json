    "intro": "Croton serratus, commonly known as the serrated croton, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, often variegated leaves that display a mix of green, yellow, and red hues. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens with suitable climatic conditions."
