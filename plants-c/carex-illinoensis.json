It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Illinois sedge is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
