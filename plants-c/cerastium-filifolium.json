    "intro": "Cerastium filifolium, commonly known as silverweed or filifolium, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and numerous small, white flowers. The plant features slender, wiry stems covered in fine, silver-tomentose hairs, which give it its common name. Its leaves are opposite, linear, and often covered in a similar silvery coating, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Cerastium filifolium is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to thrive in full sun to partial shade."
