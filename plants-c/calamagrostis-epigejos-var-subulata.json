    "intro": "Calamagrostis epigejos var. subulata, commonly known as silver grass or Japanese silver grass, is a perennial grass native to eastern Asia. It features slender, silver-blue foliage that turns coppery in the fall, making it a popular ornamental plant. The plant produces feathery panicles of pale green to golden flowers in late summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its graceful appearance and ability to form dense, low-growing clumps."
