    "intro": "Chaetaria divaricata, commonly known as the variable hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its adaptability, it is a valuable component of ecological restoration projects."
