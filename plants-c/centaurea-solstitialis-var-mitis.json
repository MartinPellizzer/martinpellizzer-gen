    "intro": "Centaurea solstitialis var. mitis, commonly known as the silverleaf globemallow, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and grasslands. It has a taproot system and can spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction. Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a noxious weed in many regions."
