    "intro": "Cyrtococcum patens var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf cyrtococcus, is a rare and elusive lichen species found in specific forest habitats. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, flattened thallus with a finely granular surface. The plant exhibits a pale to dark yellowish-green coloration, often with a slight powdery coating. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically on bark or dead wood in temperate regions. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
