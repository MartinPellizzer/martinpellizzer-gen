It is a deciduous shrub that produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers, which open at night. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. The flowers emit a strong, sweet scent at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths."
