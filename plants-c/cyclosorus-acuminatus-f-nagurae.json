It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and compact growth form. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a short, stolonic stem and clustered sporophylls. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
