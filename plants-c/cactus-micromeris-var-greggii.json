    "intro": "Cactus micromeris var. greggii, commonly known as Gregg's prickly pear, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing cactus with a ribbed stem that can reach up to 3 feet in height. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. The fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and has a sweet, juicy flavor. This plant is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping."
