    "intro": "Colchicum alpinum proles parvulum, commonly known as the alpine colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers with six petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its corm-like underground stem stores nutrients, allowing it to survive harsh alpine conditions. This species is adapted to cold, rocky environments and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes."
