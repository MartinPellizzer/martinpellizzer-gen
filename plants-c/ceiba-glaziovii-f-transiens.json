    "intro": "Ceiba glaziovii f. transiens, commonly known as the Transient Ceiba, is a rare and unique botanical variant of the Ceiba genus. It is a deciduous tree native to specific regions of Mexico, characterized by its striking, large, and often umbrella-shaped canopy. The plant exhibits a distinct morphological variation compared to its parent species, including differences in leaf structure and flowering patterns. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soils and requires ample sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
