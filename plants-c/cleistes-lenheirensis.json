    "intro": "Cleistes lenheirensis, commonly known as the yellow fairy bell, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant produces small, fragrant, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters at the base of the stems. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth texture and a slightly hairy surface. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Cleistes lenheirensis is considered a threatened species in its native range."
