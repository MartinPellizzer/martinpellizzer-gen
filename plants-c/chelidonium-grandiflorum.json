    "intro": "Chelidonium grandiflorum, commonly known as the greater celandine, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Papaveraceae family, which includes poppies and other flowering plants. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with a distinctive, often foul odor, which attracts various pollinators. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in a sticky, milky sap that contains toxic compounds. Chelidonium grandiflorum is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in sunny to partially shaded environments."
