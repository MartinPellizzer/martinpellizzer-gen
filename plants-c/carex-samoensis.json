It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered flowers in early spring.
