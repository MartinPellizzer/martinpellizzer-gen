    "intro": "Castalia sacra, commonly known as sacred castalia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts when mature. Castalia sacra is often found in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
