    "intro": "Coffea moratii, commonly known as the Moratii coffee, is a rare and lesser-known species of the Coffea genus. It is native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia, where it thrives in cool, misty environments. The plant produces small, red berries that contain two oval-shaped seeds used for coffee production. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves and compact growth habit, making it suitable for shade-grown cultivation. Due to its limited distribution and low yield, it remains a subject of interest for botanists and coffee enthusiasts alike."
