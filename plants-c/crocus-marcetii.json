It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive yellow center. The plant typically grows in rocky soils at high altitudes, showcasing its adaptation to harsh mountain environments. Its bulbs are relatively small and are often covered in a protective layer of fibrous material.
