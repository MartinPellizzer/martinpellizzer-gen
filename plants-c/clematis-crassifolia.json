    "intro": "Clematis crassifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf clematis, is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with three to five oval-shaped leaflets, often with a slightly toothed margin. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its vigorous growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or arbors, though it requires regular pruning to maintain shape. Clematis crassifolia thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a versatile addition to gardens."
