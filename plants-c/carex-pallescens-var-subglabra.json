    "intro": "Carex pallescens var. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth-haired sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, wind-pollinated flowers, and it produces three-sided, triangular seeds. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, glabrous surface on the leaves, giving it its common name."
