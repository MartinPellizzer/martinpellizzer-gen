    "intro": "Calanthe masuca f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered calanthe, is a rare and elegant orchid native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rhizomatous growth habit and its striking, pale white to cream-colored flowers. The plant produces showy, spurred orchid blooms that typically appear in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a waxy texture, and it thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings."
