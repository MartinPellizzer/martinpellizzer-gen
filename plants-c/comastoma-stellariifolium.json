    "intro": "Comastoma stellariifolium, commonly known as the star-leaved mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy, and often silver-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of delicate blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native range."
