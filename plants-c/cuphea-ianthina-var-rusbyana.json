    "intro": "Cuphea ianthina var. rusbyana, commonly known as the Rusby's firecracker, is a striking tropical plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that encase the small, tubular flowers, creating a visually appealing display. The plant produces showy, spiky flower clusters that resemble fireworks, hence its common name. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a potted plant."
