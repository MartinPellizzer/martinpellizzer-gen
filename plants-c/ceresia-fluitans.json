    "intro": "Ceresia fluitans, commonly known as the floating geranium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Geraniaceae. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its ability to float on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater. The plant has rounded, fleshy leaves that help it stay buoyant, and it produces clusters of small, pink or red flowers. It thrives in moist environments and is often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Ceresia fluitans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with water features."
