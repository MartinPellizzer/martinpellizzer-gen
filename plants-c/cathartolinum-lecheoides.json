    "intro": "Cathartolinum lecheoides, commonly known as the milkweed vine, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including livestock. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided by herbivores, which helps protect it from overgrazing."
