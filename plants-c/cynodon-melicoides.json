    "intro": "Cynodon melicoides, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. It is widely used for livestock forage and in erosion control due to its hardiness. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for landscaping in dry climates."
