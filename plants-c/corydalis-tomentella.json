    "intro": "Corydalis tomentella, commonly known as the woolly corydalis, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It features slender, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds, typical of the Fumariaceae family. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a velvety texture due to dense pubescence. Corydalis tomentella is often found in rocky or well-drained soils at higher elevations."
