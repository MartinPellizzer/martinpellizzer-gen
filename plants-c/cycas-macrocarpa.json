It is native to New Caledonia and is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with the female cones being particularly massive and ornate. Cycas macrocarpa is a slow-growing, ancient plant that thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Its unique morphology and evolutionary history make it a significant species in botanical studies."
