    "intro": "Cousinia freyniana, commonly known as the Frey's cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well-adapted to dry, harsh environments. Its leaves are usually silver-gray in color, covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss. Cousinia freyniana is often found in steppes and mountainous areas, where it contributes to the local flora and supports various pollinators."
