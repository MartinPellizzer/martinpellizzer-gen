    "intro": "Cardamine resedifolia var. subintegrifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf watercress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are typically broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are borne on slender stems. Its leaves are often described as having a peppery flavor, similar to other members of the cabbage family. This variety is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
