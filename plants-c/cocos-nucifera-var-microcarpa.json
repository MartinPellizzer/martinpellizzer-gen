    "intro": "Cocos nucifera var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf coconut palm, is a variant of the coconut tree characterized by its smaller size and compact growth habit. It produces small, rounded nuts that are typically less than 10 centimeters in diameter, distinguishing it from the standard coconut. The plant thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soils, often found near coastal regions. Its leaves are feather-like and can reach lengths of up to 4 meters, contributing to its ornamental value. This variety is also valued for its resilience to salt spray and its use in landscaping and small-scale cultivation."
