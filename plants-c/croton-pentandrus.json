    "intro": "Croton pentandrus, commonly known as the red-flowered croton, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, vibrant red flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a dramatic visual element to its appearance. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, giving it a distinctive, almost fern-like shape. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and indoor spaces. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant contain toxic compounds, requiring caution in handling and cultivation."
