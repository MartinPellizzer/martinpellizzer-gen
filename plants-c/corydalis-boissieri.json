    "intro": "Corydalis boissieri, commonly known as the Armenian Corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae and is characterized by its delicate, nodding flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Corydalis boissieri is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, although it is not widely commercially available."
