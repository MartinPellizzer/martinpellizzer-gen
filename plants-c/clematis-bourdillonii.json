    "intro": "Clematis bourdillonii, commonly known as the Burdillon's clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It features slender, twining stems that can reach lengths of up to 10 meters, allowing it to climb trees and other structures. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Clematis bourdillonii thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in temperate climates."
