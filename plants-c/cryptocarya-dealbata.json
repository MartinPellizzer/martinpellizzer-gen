    "intro": "Cryptocarya dealbata, commonly known as the silver-leaved cryptocarya, is a species of evergreen tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its smooth, silver-gray bark and lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its fruits are small, round berries that turn red when mature, providing food for native birds and mammals. Cryptocarya dealbata is often found in coastal and lowland forests, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
