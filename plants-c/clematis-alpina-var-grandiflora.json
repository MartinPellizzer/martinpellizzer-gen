    "intro": "Clematis alpina var. grandiflora, commonly known as the alpine clematis, is a climbing vine native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender, flexible stems that can reach lengths of up to 10 feet, allowing it to climb and twine around supports. The plant produces showy, white to pale blue flowers with five to seven petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, heart-shaped leaflets, and are covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental climbing plants."
