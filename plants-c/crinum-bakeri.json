    "intro": "Crinum bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's crinum, is a bulbous plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllis family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink, trumpet-shaped blooms that appear in summer. Its leaves are broad, strap-like, and often persist through winter, providing a decorative element even when flowering is dormant. Crinum bakeri is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
