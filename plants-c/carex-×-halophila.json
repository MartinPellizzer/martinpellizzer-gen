It is a hybrid species within the Carex genus, characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, strap-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in brackish or saline environments, making it an important component of tidal marsh ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate high salt levels and frequent flooding makes it a key species in stabilizing coastal soils."
