    "intro": "Cryptanthus caulescens, commonly known as the cushion plant or dwarf iron plant, is a low-growing evergreen succulent native to South America. It features dense, compact foliage with small, fleshy leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a container plant."
