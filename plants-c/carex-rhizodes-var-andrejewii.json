    "intro": "Carex rhizodes var. andrejewii, commonly known as the Andreevii sedge, is a variant of the rhizomatous sedge native to parts of eastern Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its grass-like leaves and dense, cylindrical flower spikes. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
