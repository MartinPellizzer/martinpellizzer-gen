    "intro": "Cracca virginiana var. holosericea, commonly known as the silky cranesbill, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its stems are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. The variety holosericea is distinguished by its dense, silky pubescence on the stems and leaves, giving it a soft, velvety appearance."
