    "intro": "Cotyledon ausana, commonly known as the African snowball, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially when exposed to sunlight. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it drought-tolerant. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
