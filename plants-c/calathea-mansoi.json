    "intro": "Calathea mansoi, commonly known as the \"Ripple Leaf\" or \"Crazy Daisy,\" is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that display a unique pattern of green, white, and purple hues. The leaves are often described as having a wavy or ruffled appearance, which gives the plant its common name. Calathea mansoi thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and indirect light. Its foliage is not only ornamental but also exhibits a fascinating ability to change color in response to light, a phenomenon known as nyctinasty."
