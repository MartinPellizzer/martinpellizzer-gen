    "intro": "Cardamine lucens, commonly known as the slender watercress, is a small herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a glossy, dark green appearance and small white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in suitable habitats. Cardamine lucens is often found in calcareous soils and is considered a characteristic species of mesic to wet forest ecosystems."
