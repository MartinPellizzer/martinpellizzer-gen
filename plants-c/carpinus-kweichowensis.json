It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
