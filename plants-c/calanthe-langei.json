    "intro": "Calanthe langei, commonly known as the Lange's calanthe, is a rare and elegant orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces showy, lance-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate markings. It thrives in cool, shaded environments and requires well-drained, humus-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calanthe langei is considered a delicate and endangered species."
