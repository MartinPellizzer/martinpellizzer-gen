    "intro": "Cassipourea gossweileri, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas within lowland forests and is known for its simple, opposite leaves. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are white or pale pink, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in its native range."
