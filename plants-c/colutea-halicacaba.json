    "intro": "Colutea halicacaba, commonly known as the Mediterranean broom, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, branched stems that often grow along the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its compound leaves are pinnate, with numerous small leaflets that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Colutea halicacaba is adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy species in Mediterranean climates."
