    "intro": "Convolvulus chartaceus, commonly known as the paperleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are thin and papery in texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically opening in the morning. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
