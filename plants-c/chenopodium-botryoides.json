    "intro": "Chenopodium botryoides, commonly known as tumbleweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its bushy, mat-forming growth habit and small, green, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, green flowers that develop into dry, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots and a capacity to store water. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal make it both a pioneer species and a potential invasive plant in some regions."
