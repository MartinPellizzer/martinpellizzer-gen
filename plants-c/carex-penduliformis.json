It is native to eastern North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, arching leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Carex penduliformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland habitats."
