    "intro": "Carex nigra subsp. turfosa, commonly known as black sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dark green, narrow leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands, marshes, or along streambanks. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
