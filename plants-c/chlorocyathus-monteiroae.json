    "intro": "Chlorocyathus monteiroae, commonly known as the golden cup coral, is a unique marine invertebrate belonging to the order Ceriantharia. It is characterized by its delicate, branched polyps that resemble a cup-like structure, which is why it is named \"cup coral.\" The organism is typically found in shallow, tropical waters, where it attaches itself to hard substrates such as rocks or coral reefs. Its coloration ranges from yellow to orange, giving it its common name. This species plays a role in the marine ecosystem by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to the biodiversity of reef environments."
