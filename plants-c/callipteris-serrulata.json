    "intro": "Callipteris serrulata, commonly known as the coastal maidenhair fern, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and is often found in coastal dunes and sandy soils. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and stabilize sand dunes effectively. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a feathery appearance that gives it a graceful look. Callipteris serrulata is also valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in harsh coastal environments."
