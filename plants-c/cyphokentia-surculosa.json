It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-pink flowers that are borne in dense, cone-like structures. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires moderate to high light exposure. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
