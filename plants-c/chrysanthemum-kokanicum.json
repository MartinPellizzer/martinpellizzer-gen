    "intro": "Chrysanthemum kokanicum, commonly known as the Kokanica chrysanthemum, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb with a robust root system and upright stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, white, and orange, typically blooming in the autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Chrysanthemum kokanicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
