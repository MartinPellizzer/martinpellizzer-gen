    "intro": "Callitris oblonga, commonly known as the broad-leafed white cypress, is a species of coniferous tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Callitris oblonga is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its ornamental appearance."
