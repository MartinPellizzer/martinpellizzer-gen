    "intro": "Carex ceramica, commonly known as the Ceramica sedge, is a perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands. Carex ceramica is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
