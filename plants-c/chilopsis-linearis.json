    "intro": "Chilopsis linearis, commonly known as the desert willow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, which attract hummingbirds and other pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and linear, hence the species name \"linearis,\" and it has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. Chilopsis linearis is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
