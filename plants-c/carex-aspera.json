    "intro": "Carex aspera, commonly known as rough sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant has slender, triangular stems that often grow in dense clumps, and its leaves are typically rough to the touch, giving it its common name. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually green or brown, and it thrives in moist to wet environments such as marshes and wetlands. Carex aspera is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
