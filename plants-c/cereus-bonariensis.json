    "intro": "Cereus bonariensis, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, a feature that attracts nocturnal pollinators. Its flowers are short-lived, usually lasting only a single night. Cereus bonariensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and unique flowering behavior."
