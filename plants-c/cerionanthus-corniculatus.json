    "intro": "Cerionanthus corniculatus, commonly known as the horned hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny fruit capsules that resemble small horns, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by edible nuts that are a food source for various wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value. Cerionanthus corniculatus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or woodland habitats."
