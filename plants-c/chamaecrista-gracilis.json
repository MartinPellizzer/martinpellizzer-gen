    "intro": "Chamaecrista gracilis, commonly known as slender ticktree, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are slender pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Chamaecrista gracilis is often found in sandy soils along roadsides and in open woodlands."
