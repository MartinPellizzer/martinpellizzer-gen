    "intro": "Corybas smithianus, commonly known as the Smith's hooded orchid, is a unique orchid species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, hood-like flower structure, which is typically green or brown with a central spur. The plant is a terrestrial orchid that grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest floors or rocky areas. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with a single, erect flower per stem. Corybas smithianus is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism, relying on flies rather than bees."
