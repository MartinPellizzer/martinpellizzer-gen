It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, and its flowers have a distinctive, citrus-like scent. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
