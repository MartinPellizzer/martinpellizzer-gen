    "intro": "Cirsium schantarense, commonly known as the Schantaren thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower heads. Cirsium schantarense is relatively rare and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
