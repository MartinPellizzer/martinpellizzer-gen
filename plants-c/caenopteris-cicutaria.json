    "intro": "Caenopteris cicutaria, commonly known as the slender maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures are typically located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Caenopteris cicutaria plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
