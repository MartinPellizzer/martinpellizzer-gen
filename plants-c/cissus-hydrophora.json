It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources. Its stems are succulent and can store water, allowing it to survive in humid conditions. Cissus hydrophora is also known for its ability to root at nodes, making it easy to propagate."
