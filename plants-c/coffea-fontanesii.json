    "intro": "Coffea fontanesii, commonly known as the Fontanesii coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the highlands of Ethiopia, where it thrives in cool, humid climates. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds used for coffee. It is a shade-tolerant species, often found growing under the canopy of other plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered coffee species."
