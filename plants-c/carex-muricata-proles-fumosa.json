It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown to grayish flowers, giving it its \"smoky\" appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.
