    "intro": "Camaion hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy camaion, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Amaranthaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its small, clustered flowers are typically greenish-white or yellow, and it produces small, round fruits that contain seeds. Camaion hirsuta is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to grow in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and forest edges."
