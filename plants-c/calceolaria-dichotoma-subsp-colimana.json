It is characterized by its unique bilaterally symmetrical flowers that resemble small slippers, a trait typical of the Calceolaria genus. The plant typically grows in rocky or clay soils in high-altitude regions, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking blooms."
