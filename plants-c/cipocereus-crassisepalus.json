    "intro": "Cipocereus crassisepalus, commonly known as the thick-stemmed cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces pale yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. It has spiny areoles, which are clusters of spines, hairs, and flowers, typical of the Cactaceae family. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for collectors and succulent enthusiasts."
