    "intro": "Colchicum montanum var. pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf autumn crocus, is a member of the Colchicaceae family. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant produces a corm-like structure known as a bulb, which serves as its storage organ. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is cultivated in gardens and studied for its alkaloid content."
