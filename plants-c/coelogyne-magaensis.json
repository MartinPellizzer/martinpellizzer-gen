    "intro": "Coelogyne magaensis, commonly known as the Mogaung orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Myanmar. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its leaves are long and strap-like, and it produces showy, often pink or white, blossoms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
