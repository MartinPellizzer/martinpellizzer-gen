    "intro": "Cupressus horizontalis, commonly known as the creeping cypress, is a species of coniferous evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, round cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Cupressus horizontalis thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover. Its slow growth rate and drought tolerance make it a low-maintenance plant for various garden settings."
