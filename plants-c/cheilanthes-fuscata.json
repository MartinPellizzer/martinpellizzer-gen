    "intro": "Cheilanthes fuscata, commonly known as the rusty rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and rocky habitats in the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a terrestrial fern that thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on limestone or sandstone. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Cheilanthes fuscata is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy and resilient plant in harsh environments."
