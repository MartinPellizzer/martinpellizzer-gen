    "intro": "Cyanus jacea, commonly known as the Italian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and woodland edges. Cyanus jacea is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its historical use in traditional medicine."
