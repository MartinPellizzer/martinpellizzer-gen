    "intro": "Cyathea cystolepis, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several decades, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional M\u0101ori medicine, and it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat. The fronds are typically evergreen, providing year-round foliage and contributing to the forest canopy structure."
