    "intro": "Cuspidaria lachnaea, commonly known as the white lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Lecanoraceae and is characterized by its pale gray to white thallus with a distinctive, crust-like texture. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. Its structure consists of a fungal component that anchors it to surfaces, while the algal partner contributes to its pigmentation and energy production. This lichen is often found on bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions."
