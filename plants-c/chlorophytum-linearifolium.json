    "intro": "Chlorophytum linearifolium, commonly known as the snake plant, is a hardy, evergreen perennial native to South Africa. It features long, narrow, upright leaves that are typically variegated with yellow or white stripes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and requires minimal watering, making it an ideal houseplant. It produces small, inconspicuous green flowers on slender stems, though these are rarely seen in cultivation. Its air-purifying qualities and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
