    "intro": "Cirsium maackii var. horridum, commonly known as the Maack's thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features a robust, upright stem covered in stiff, spiny hairs, which contribute to its defensive characteristics. The plant produces large, purple to pinkish-purple flower heads, which are typically composite, consisting of both ray and disc florets. Its leaves are deeply lobed, with rough, sometimes hairy surfaces, and often have a serrated or toothed margin. This species is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields, where it can form dense colonies."
