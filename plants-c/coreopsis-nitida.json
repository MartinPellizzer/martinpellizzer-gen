    "intro": "Coreopsis nitida, commonly known as the silverleaf coreopsis, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray, fuzzy foliage and bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and prefers well-drained soil in full sun. Its compact growth habit makes it an excellent choice for rock gardens or as a border plant. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and other composite flowers."
