    "intro": "Cystopteris \u00d7 illinoensis, commonly known as the Illinois maidenhair fern, is a hybrid fern species that exhibits a mix of traits from its parent species, Cystopteris bulbosa and Cystopteris fragilis. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces spores in small, club-shaped sporangia that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The hybrid nature of Cystopteris \u00d7 illinoensis contributes to its adaptability and ornamental value in horticulture."
