    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris hians, commonly known as the common chickweed or mouse ear. It is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae, characterized by its low-growing habit and small, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by distinctive heart-shaped pods that contain seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a common weed in many regions."
