    "intro": "Cynosurus cristatus var. polybracteatus, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and the presence of long, hairy bracts along the flowering stems. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
