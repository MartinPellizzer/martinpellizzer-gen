    "intro": "Cystopus puberulus, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually simple and may have a hairy texture, contributing to its common name. Cystopus puberulus is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the nutrients obtained from captured prey."
