    "intro": "Carduus occidentalis, commonly known as the western cocklebur, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and large, yellow composite flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces rough, spherical fruits that contain seeds with hooked bracts, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in waste areas. Botanically, it is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers."
