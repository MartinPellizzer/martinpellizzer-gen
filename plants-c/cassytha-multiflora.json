    "intro": "Cassytha multiflora, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks true roots, leaves, and stems. It attaches itself to host plants using specialized structures called haustoria, which extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is considered an invasive species in many areas due to its ability to spread rapidly. Its unique morphology and parasitic nature make it an interesting subject in botanical studies."
