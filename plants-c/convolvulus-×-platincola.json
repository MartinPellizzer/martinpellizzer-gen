    "intro": "Convolvulus \u00d7 platincola, commonly known as the blue morning glory, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in the early morning, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is native to regions of the Mediterranean and is often found growing in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its climbing habit is supported by tendrils that help it ascend structures, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
