It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge, forming a rosette shape. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves to survive drought conditions. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
