It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its yellow flowers bloom in the summer months, adding a splash of color to high-altitude landscapes. Chrysopsis alpina is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness in challenging climates."
