    "intro": "Coryphantha echinus var. robusta, commonly known as the robust hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are typically green with a reddish tinge. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to desert environments. The varietal name 'robusta' reflects its robust growth and thick, fleshy stems compared to other varieties of Coryphantha."
