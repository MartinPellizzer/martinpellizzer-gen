    "intro": "Crepidium foetidum, commonly known as the stinking orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that emit a strong, unpleasant odor, which is believed to attract specific pollinators. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers. The botanical features of Crepidium foetidum make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
