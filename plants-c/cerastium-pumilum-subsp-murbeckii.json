    "intro": "Cerastium pumilum subsp. murbeckii, commonly known as the dwarf mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features prostrate or ascending stems that are often hairy, and it produces small, white flowers with five petals. The leaves are typically basal, oval-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in disturbed habitats."
