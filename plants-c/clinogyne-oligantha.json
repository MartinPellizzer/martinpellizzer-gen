    "intro": "Clinogyne oligantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on rocky outcrops or coastal dunes. Clinogyne oligantha is an important component of coastal vegetation, providing habitat for native wildlife."
