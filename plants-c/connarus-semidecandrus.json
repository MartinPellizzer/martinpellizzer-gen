    "intro": "Connarus semidecandrus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark red wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Due to overharvesting, Connarus semidecandrus is now considered an endangered species in its natural habitat."
