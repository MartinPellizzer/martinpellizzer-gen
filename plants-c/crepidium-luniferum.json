    "intro": "Crepidium luniferum, commonly known as the moon orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has a short, hairy stem and narrow, grass-like leaves that help it survive in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are unique in shape, resembling a crescent moon, which gives it its common name. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
