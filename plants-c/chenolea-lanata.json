    "intro": "Chenolea lanata, commonly known as the woolly chenopod, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a woolly appearance, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are succulent and adapted for water storage, making it well-suited to drought conditions. Chenolea lanata plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
