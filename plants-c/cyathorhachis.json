    "intro": "Cyathorhachis, commonly known as the \"spear-headed cup plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a cup-like calyx that encloses the reproductive organs. The plant typically has hairy stems and alternate leaves with a rough texture. Cyathorhachis species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant morphology and ecological adaptation."
