    "intro": "Carex pendula subsp. welwitschii, commonly known as the hanging sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its drooping, grass-like inflorescences that give it a distinctive, cascading appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth, waxy surface. The flowering stems produce small, greenish-brown spikes that mature into brown, seed-bearing structures."
