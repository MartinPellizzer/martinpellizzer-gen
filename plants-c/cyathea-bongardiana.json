    "intro": "Cyathea bongardiana, commonly known as the Bongard's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several decades, making it a long-lived species. Its rhizomes produce roots that anchor it to the substrate, while its fronds are responsible for photosynthesis. Cyathea bongardiana is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks."
