    "intro": "Cassytha tepperiana, commonly known as the creeping cassytha, is a parasitic flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its slender, vine-like stems that often grow along the ground or through the foliage of other plants. The plant lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants using specialized structures called haustoria, which extract nutrients from the host. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are typically arranged in clusters and are pollinated by insects. Cassytha tepperiana is often found in humid, shaded environments and can be invasive in certain ecosystems."
