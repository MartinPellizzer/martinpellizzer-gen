    "intro": "Campanula clivosa, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Campanula clivosa has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
