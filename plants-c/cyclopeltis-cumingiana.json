    "intro": "Cyclopeltis cumingiana, commonly known as the Cuming's cyclopeltis, is a rare and striking member of the Araliaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in regions of Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its unique, palmate leaves that are often adorned with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its humid habitat. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically greenish-white in color, and it produces berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
