    "intro": "Cephalidium citrifolium, commonly known as the citronleaf sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of the western Atlantic. It is characterized by its striking, lemon-yellow leaves and clusters of small, blue-violet flowers that bloom throughout the summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in shallow marine environments. Its unique morphology includes a rosette-like growth pattern and specialized structures for salt tolerance. Cephalidium citrifolium plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for various marine organisms."
