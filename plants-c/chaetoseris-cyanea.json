It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It produces small, blue to violet flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually hairy and arranged in a basal rosette, which helps it conserve water in arid environments."
