    "intro": "Calamagrostis spicigera, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and silvery-blue foliage that adds a striking visual contrast to landscapes. The plant produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers in late summer, which are often visited by pollinators. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
