    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna f. trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed hawthorn, is a unique variant of the common hawthorn. It is characterized by its distinctive three-lobed leaves, which set it apart from the typical single-lobed leaves of the standard species. This form is a natural variant that occurs in certain regions of Europe, particularly in the UK and parts of southern Scandinavia. The plant produces small, white flowers in spring, followed by red berries in autumn. It is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
