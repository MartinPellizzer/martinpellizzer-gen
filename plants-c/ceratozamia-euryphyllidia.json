    "intro": "Ceratozamia euryphyllidia, commonly known as the broad-leafed cycad, is a species of cycad native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and it is valued for its ornamental appearance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered threatened in the wild."
