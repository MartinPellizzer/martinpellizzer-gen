    "intro": "Campanula scheuchzeri subf. hirtescens, commonly known as the hairy bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the high alpine regions of Europe. It features upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in its cold, arid habitat. The plant produces bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and also covered in a dense layer of hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This sub-species is adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, thriving in environments with full sun and low moisture."
