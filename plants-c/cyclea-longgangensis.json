    "intro": "Cyclea longgangensis, commonly known as the Longgang cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. Native to China, this plant thrives in humid, subtropical climates with well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures include large, cone-like strobili, typical of cycads. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cyclea longgangensis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
