    "intro": "Carduus uncinatus subsp. transcaspicus, commonly known as the Transcaspian thistle, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and a tall, branched flower head composed of yellow ray florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy habitats, showing adaptability to arid environments. It produces small, achene fruits that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across suitable regions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been introduced to other parts of the world for horticultural purposes."
