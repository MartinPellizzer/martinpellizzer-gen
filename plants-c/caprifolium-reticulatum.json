    "intro": "Caprifolium reticulatum, commonly known as the net-veined honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It features opposite, oval-shaped leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or yellow, which bloom in early spring. Its berries are red or black and are edible, though often tart. Caprifolium reticulatum is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and floral display."
