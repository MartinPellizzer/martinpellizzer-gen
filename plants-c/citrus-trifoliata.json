    "intro": "Citrus trifoliata, commonly known as the Chinese lime or wild lime, is a small evergreen shrub native to China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and its fragrant, yellow-orange fruits that are smaller than typical citrus fruits. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are often clustered together, and it is known for its high concentration of citric acid in its fruit. Citrus trifoliata is often used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant due to its distinctive appearance and aromatic properties."
