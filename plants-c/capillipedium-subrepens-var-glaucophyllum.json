    "intro": "Capillipedium subrepens var. glaucophyllum, commonly known as the glaucophyll variant of the creeping capillipedium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the forest floor. The leaves are typically linear to lanceolate, with a bluish-green hue due to the presence of a waxy cuticle. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, often borne on short pedicels. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils."
