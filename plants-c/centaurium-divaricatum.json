    "intro": "Centaurium divaricatum, commonly known as the variable centaury, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Gentianaceae family, characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant grows in moist meadows and grasslands, often in temperate climates. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
