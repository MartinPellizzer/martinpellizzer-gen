    "intro": "Cirsium bracteosum, commonly known as the bracted thistle, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flower heads that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in scrublands and grasslands. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Cirsium bracteosum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its architectural form."
