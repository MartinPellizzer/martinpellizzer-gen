It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, alternate leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help protect it from excessive moisture loss. The species is notable for its unique floral structure, with the stamens prominently displayed in the flower clusters."
