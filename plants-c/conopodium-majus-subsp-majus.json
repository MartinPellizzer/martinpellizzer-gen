    "intro": "Conopodium majus subsp. majus, commonly known as the greater bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its branched, root-like structures called rhizophores, which anchor it to substrates in freshwater environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically borne on short pedicels, and it is often found in ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, bladder-like structures that aid in trapping small aquatic organisms. This species is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor waters and its unique adaptations for both photosynthesis and nutrient acquisition."
