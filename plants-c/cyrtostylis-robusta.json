    "intro": "Cyrtostylis robusta, commonly known as the robust lady's-tresses, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and its striking, fragrant inflorescence composed of numerous white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in rich, organic soil. Cyrtostylis robusta is a perennial herb that produces its flowers in late summer or early autumn. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
