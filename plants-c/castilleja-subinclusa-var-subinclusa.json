    "intro": "Castilleja subinclusa var. subinclusa, commonly known as the narrowleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright orange or red bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on root connections to host plants for water and nutrients. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its floral structure is adapted for pollination by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological role in native plant communities."
