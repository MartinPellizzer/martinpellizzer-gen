    "intro": "Cypripedium macranthos f. flavoroseum, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper, is a striking orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow pouch-shaped flower with a distinctive red lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, organic soils. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered endangered in many areas."
