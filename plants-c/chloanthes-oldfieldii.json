    "intro": "Chloanthes oldfieldii, commonly known as the Oldfield's ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pale green, leaf-like stems and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific soil and moisture conditions to survive. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
