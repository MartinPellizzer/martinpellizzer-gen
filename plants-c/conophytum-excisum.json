It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its compact, basal rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves. The leaves are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to store water in arid environments. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
