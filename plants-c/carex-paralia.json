    "intro": "Carex paralia, commonly known as sea clubmoss, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It is a perennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense, tussock-like clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, sandy soils along shores and salt marshes, showing some tolerance to saline conditions. Its ecological role includes stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
