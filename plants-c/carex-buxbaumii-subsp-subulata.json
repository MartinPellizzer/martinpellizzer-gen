    "intro": "Carex buxbaumii subsp. subulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale to brownish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other waterlogged habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
