It is characterized by its striking yellow petals and sepals that resemble a bell, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the understory of rainforests. Its flowers are fragrant and attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Cirrhopetalum chryseum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
