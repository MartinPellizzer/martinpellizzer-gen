    "intro": "Cydonia oblonga f. pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal quince, is a cultivar of the quince plant characterized by its distinctive, pyramid-shaped fruit. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region, known for its aromatic, yellow-orange fruit that ripens in late autumn. The leaves are broad and ovate, with a smooth surface and a slightly serrated edge. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often grown in gardens for its fragrant blossoms and unique fruit shape. The fruit, while not as commonly eaten as other quince varieties, is used in jams, jellies, and traditional recipes."
