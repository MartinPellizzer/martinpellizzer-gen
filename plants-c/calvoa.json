    "intro": "Calvoa, commonly known as the \"milkweed of the Andes,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to South America. These plants are characterized by their hairy stems and showy, often yellow or orange, flowers. Calvoa species are typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, where they have adapted to withstand drought conditions. The leaves are usually alternate and may have a glandular surface, which helps in reducing water loss. Some species of Calvoa produce a milky sap, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus."
