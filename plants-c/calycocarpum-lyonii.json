    "intro": "Calycocarpum lyonii, commonly known as the Lyon's calycocarp, is a rare and endangered species native to the western United States. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically red or orange when mature. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
