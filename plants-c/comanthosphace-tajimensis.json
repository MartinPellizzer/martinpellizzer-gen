    "intro": "Comanthosphace tajimensis, commonly known as the Tajimenis ghost sponge, is a unique deep-sea organism that belongs to the phylum Porifera. It is characterized by its translucent, gelatinous body and a complex network of pores and canals that facilitate water filtration. This species is found in the deep waters of the Atlantic Ocean, particularly around the Azores and Canary Islands. Its structure is adapted to withstand high pressure and low light conditions, making it a fascinating subject for marine biologists. Due to its rarity and fragile nature, it is considered a vulnerable species in its ecosystem."
