    "intro": "Carponema filiformis, commonly known as the thread liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the order Marchantiales. It is a small, leafy liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thallus that is often ribbon-like or filamentous in appearance, with distinct lobes and a flat, sprawling growth habit. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having structures called rhizoids for anchorage and absorption. Carponema filiformis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
