    "intro": "Cynodon pilosus, commonly known as the hairy Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to form dense, resilient turf. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for lawns and erosion control. Its ability to spread through stolons and rhizomes contributes to its aggressive growth and adaptability. Cynodon pilosus is also valued for its tolerance to heat and drought conditions."
