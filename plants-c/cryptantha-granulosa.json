It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a compact, mat-forming growth habit. Its leaves are hairy and often have a granular texture, which gives it its common name. Cryptantha granulosa is adapted to arid environments and is often found in open grasslands and along roadsides."
