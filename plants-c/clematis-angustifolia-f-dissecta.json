    "intro": "Clematis angustifolia f. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected narrowleaf clematis, is a cultivar of the clematis plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple during the late spring to early summer. It is a vigorous climber that thrives in partial shade to full sun and well-drained soil. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and naturalized landscapes."
