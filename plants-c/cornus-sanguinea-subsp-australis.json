    "intro": "Cornus sanguinea subsp. australis, commonly known as red dogwood, is a shrub native to parts of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive red stems, which are covered in small, rough, reddish-brown hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that attract birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
