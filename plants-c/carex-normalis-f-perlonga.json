    "intro": "Carex normalis f. perlonga, commonly known as the long-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with long, narrow leaves that are often slightly curved. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale to greenish flowers, which are typical of sedges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wet environments."
