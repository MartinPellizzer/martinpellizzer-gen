    "intro": "Coccoloba cristalensis, commonly known as the crystalline coccoloba, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to parts of Central and South America, particularly in regions with humid climates. The plant is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often found growing in moist, shaded environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
