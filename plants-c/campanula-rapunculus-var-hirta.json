It features upright stems covered in fine, hairy texture, which gives it its botanical name. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine downy coating, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soil."
