    "intro": "Catha cassinoides, commonly known as Khat, is a flowering plant native to the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds, though it is not closely related to them. The plant is characterized by its trailing stems, heart-shaped leaves, and small, yellow flowers that develop into green, elongated fruits. The leaves and young stems are harvested and used for their stimulant properties due to the presence of cathinone and cathine. It is often cultivated for both ornamental and traditional medicinal purposes."
