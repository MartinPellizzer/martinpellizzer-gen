It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and showy, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to some animals, including humans, and contains cardiac glycosides. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Cynanchum haughtii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas."
