    "intro": "Cuscuta bonariensis, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure with tiny, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to South America but has been introduced to many other regions, including parts of Europe and North America. It can infest a wide range of crops and ornamental plants, causing significant agricultural damage. Despite its parasitic nature, Cuscuta bonariensis plays a role in ecological systems by influencing plant community dynamics."
