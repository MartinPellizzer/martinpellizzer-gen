    "intro": "Carex edgariae, commonly known as Edgariae sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to the eastern United States, particularly found in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and stream banks. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, with grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. Its botanical features include rhizomatous growth and the ability to form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its tolerance of waterlogged conditions and its role in soil stabilization."
