    "intro": "Cerasus dulcis, commonly known as the sweet cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is native to Asia, particularly China, and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces showy white or pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by sweet, juicy fruits in summer. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, while the bark is smooth and grayish-brown. The fruit, which is the edible part, contains a single hard pit and is rich in antioxidants and vitamins."
