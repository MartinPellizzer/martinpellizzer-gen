    "intro": "Cupressus sempervirens var. dupreziana, commonly known as the Duprezian lacewood, is a rare and ornamental cultivar of the Mediterranean cypress. It is characterized by its unique, feathery foliage that forms a dense, compact crown, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in flat, fan-shaped sprays, contributing to its ornamental value. It is typically grown as a specimen tree in gardens and landscapes due to its slow growth and elegant form. This variety is well-suited to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a prized addition to horticultural collections."
