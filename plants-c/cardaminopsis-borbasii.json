    "intro": "Cardaminopsis borbasii, commonly known as the Borbas\u2019s watercress, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant features small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along streams and in rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
