    "intro": "Cosmidium, commonly known as the water clover, is a genus of aquatic ferns belonging to the family Marsileaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, floating leaves that resemble a cloverleaf shape, typically with four lobes. Cosmidium species are native to freshwater environments in tropical and subtropical regions around the world. They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life. Their delicate, feathery fronds make them popular in ornamental ponds and water gardens."
