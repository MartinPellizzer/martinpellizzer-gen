    "intro": "Courantia rosea, commonly known as the rose sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, succulent stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Courantia rosea is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
