    "intro": "Conchocarpus acuminatus, commonly known as the red mangrove or *Rhizophora mangle*, is a tropical tree native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive red, knobby fruits that contain a single seed, which is adapted for dispersal by water. The plant has aerial roots that help it anchor in soft, waterlogged soils and facilitate gas exchange. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
