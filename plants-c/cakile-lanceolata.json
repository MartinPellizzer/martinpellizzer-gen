    "intro": "Cakile lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms a dense mat of foliage close to the ground. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Its small, yellow flowers appear in clusters and bloom in early spring. Cakile lanceolata is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
