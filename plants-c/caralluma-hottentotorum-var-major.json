    "intro": "Caralluma hottentotorum var. major, commonly known as the greater prickly pear, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. This species is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
