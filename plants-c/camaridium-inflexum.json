    "intro": "Camaridium inflexum, commonly known as the flexible clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant in the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, creeping habit with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces strobila, which are cone-like structures that contain spores for reproduction. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Camaridium inflexum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
