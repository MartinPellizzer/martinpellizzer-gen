It typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white to pale blue flowers in clusters. Conyza bryoides is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, making it a common weed in agricultural settings. It is also characterized by its distinctive seed dispersal mechanism, which involves the release of small, wind-borne seeds."
