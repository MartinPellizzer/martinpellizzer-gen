    "intro": "Cerastium juniperorum, commonly known as the juniper cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its leaves are typically oval or lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in rocky or dry soils. Cerastium juniperorum is often found in alpine or subalpine environments, where it contributes to soil stabilization and biodiversity."
