It is characterized by its striking orange-red tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves and is typically found growing along coastal areas or in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many plants with milky sap and showy flowers. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
