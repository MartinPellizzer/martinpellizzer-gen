    "intro": "Crocus babiogorensis, commonly known as the Babiogorensis crocus, is a rare and endemic species native to a specific region in the Balkans. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, early spring blooming period. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive, narrow shape. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in rocky and well-drained soils, typical of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
