    "intro": "Cytisus fontanesii subsp. apiculatus, commonly known as the Alpine broom, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are small, trifoliate, and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are typically woody and branched. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its botanical features make it an important plant for ecological studies in high-altitude environments."
