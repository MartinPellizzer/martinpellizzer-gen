    "intro": "Cassia tagera, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendulous clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces elongated, flat pods that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cassia tagera is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets that have a slightly serrated edge."
