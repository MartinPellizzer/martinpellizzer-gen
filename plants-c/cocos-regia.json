    "intro": "Cocos regia, commonly known as the royal coconut, is a tropical plant belonging to the Arecaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers that eventually develop into the familiar coconut fruits. Its fibrous husk contains a nutritious liquid called coconut water, which is rich in electrolytes. Cocos regia thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for both its fruit and ornamental value."
