    "intro": "Chlorospatha narinoensis, commonly known as the Narino sun-leaf, is a striking member of the Araceae family native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its large, broad, bright green leaves that are often marked with intricate white or yellow veins, giving it a sunlit appearance. The plant produces an inflorescence known as a spadix, which is surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
