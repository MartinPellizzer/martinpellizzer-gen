    "intro": "Caroxylon tamariscinum, commonly known as the desert shrub or tamarisk, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting it to harsh environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It has a woody stem that can grow quite tall, often reaching several meters in height. Caroxylon tamariscinum is known for its resilience and is often found in coastal and inland saline soils."
