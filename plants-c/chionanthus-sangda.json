    "intro": "Chionanthus sangda, commonly known as the Sangda snowbell, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its gray-green foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly serrated margin. The fruit is a small, capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature, contributing to its limited natural distribution."
