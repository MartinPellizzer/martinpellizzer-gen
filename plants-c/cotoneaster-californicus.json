    "intro": "Cotoneaster californicus, commonly known as the California cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 feet and features small, glossy green leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Cotoneaster californicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
