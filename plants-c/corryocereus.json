    "intro": "Corryocereus, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a genus of cacti native to South America. These plants are characterized by their spiny stems and showy, fragrant flowers that open at night. The flowers are typically white or pale pink and have a strong, sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. Corryocereus species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid conditions. They require minimal water and well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
