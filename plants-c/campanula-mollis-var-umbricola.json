    "intro": "Campanula mollis var. umbricola, commonly known as the shade-loving bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically ranging in color from blue to purple. The leaves are elongated and slightly hairy, adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments. This variety is well-suited for woodland gardens or shaded rockeries due to its preference for partial to full shade. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, aiding in its propagation."
