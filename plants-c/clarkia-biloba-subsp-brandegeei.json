    "intro": "Clarkia biloba subsp. brandegeei, commonly known as the Brandegee's Clarkia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and its flowers are often clustered in racemes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
