    "intro": "Centaurea euxina, commonly known as the Crimean centaury, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and spiny, bristly foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its flowers are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. Centaurea euxina is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
