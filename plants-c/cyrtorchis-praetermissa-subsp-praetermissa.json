    "intro": "Cyrtorchis praetermissa subsp. praetermissa, commonly known as the slender ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows on decaying wood in moist, shaded forest environments. It has a unique morphology with narrow, grass-like leaves and a slender, unbranched stem. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered a conservation concern."
