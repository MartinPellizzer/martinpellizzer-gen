    "intro": "Calanthe discolor f. rufoaurantiaca, commonly known as the red-lipped calanthe, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its elegant, lance-shaped leaves and its distinctive pinkish-red lips that contrast with its white or pale pink petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats, often in forest understories where it receives dappled sunlight. Its flowers are clustered in a raceme, and the species is noted for its ornamental value in horticulture. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
