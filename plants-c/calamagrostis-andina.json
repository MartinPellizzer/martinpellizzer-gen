    "intro": "Calamagrostis andina, commonly known as Andean feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces delicate, feathery plumes that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine environments, often in rocky or well-drained soils. Its height can range from 1 to 3 meters, making it a striking feature in high-altitude landscapes. Calamagrostis andina is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain."
