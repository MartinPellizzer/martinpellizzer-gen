It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand cold temperatures make it well adapted to alpine environments. It is often found in meadows and open slopes where it contributes to the biodiversity of these ecosystems."
