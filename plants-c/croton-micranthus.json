    "intro": "Croton micranthus, commonly known as the small-flowered croton, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its striking, colorful leaves that often display a variety of hues including red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
