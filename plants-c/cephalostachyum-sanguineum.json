    "intro": "Cephalostachyum sanguineum, commonly known as the red-flowered papyrus, is a striking plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems and dense clusters of bright red bracts that resemble flowers. The plant thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshy areas near water bodies. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it requires specific moisture conditions to flourish and is not commonly cultivated outside its native habitat."
