    "intro": "Campylochnella thollonii, commonly known as the red-flowered rock orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking red petals and a compact, epiphytic growth habit, often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to conserve moisture in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
