    "intro": "Chione, commonly known as the snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its fragrant, white flowers that resemble small bells. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of a fern, while its stems are often hairy. Chione blooms in early spring, adding a delicate touch of white to woodland landscapes."
