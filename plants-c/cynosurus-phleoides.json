    "intro": "Cynosurus phleoides, commonly known as the creeping hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Cynosurus phleoides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse invertebrate life."
