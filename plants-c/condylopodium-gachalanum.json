    "intro": "Condylopodium gachalanum, commonly known as the Gachal\u00e1n ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its slender, elongated stems and delicate, translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on the trunks of trees or in rocky crevices. Its flowers are typically pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Condylopodium gachalanum is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
