It features opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by orange to red berries in the fall. Its stems are often twining and have a somewhat woody texture, allowing it to climb and spread along vegetation. The species is noted for its adaptability to various soil types and its role in supporting local wildlife."
