    "intro": "Ceratopteris cornuta, commonly known as the horned water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that bear small, spore-producing structures called sorangia, which are clustered in fleshy, horn-like formations. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. Ceratopteris cornuta is often used in scientific research due to its rapid growth and ease of cultivation."
