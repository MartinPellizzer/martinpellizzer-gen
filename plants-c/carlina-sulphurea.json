    "intro": "Carlina sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphur crownbeard, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features bright yellow ray flowers surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Carlina sulphurea thrives in dry, sunny habitats and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
