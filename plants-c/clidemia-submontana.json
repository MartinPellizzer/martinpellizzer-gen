    "intro": "Clidemia submontana, commonly known as mountain mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its showy, often violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and is often found in montane regions. Its leaves are usually opposite, ovate, and have a velvety texture. Clidemia submontana plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small organisms."
