    "intro": "Cenostigma nordestinum, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit or Brazilian star-apple, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to starfruit, though they are not related to the genus Averrhoa. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit. The botanical features of Cenostigma nordestinum make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
