    "intro": "Cheilanthes fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in dry, well-drained soils. The plant has lance-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically arranged in dense clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. The species is also noted for its ability to form dense colonies, which can stabilize soil in rocky habitats."
