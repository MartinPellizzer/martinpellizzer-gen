    "intro": "Ctenitis maolanensis, commonly known as the Maolan fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically divided into narrow segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of its fronds. Ctenitis maolanensis is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in botanical gardens."
