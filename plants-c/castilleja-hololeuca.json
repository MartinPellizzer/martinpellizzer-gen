    "intro": "Castilleja hololeuca, commonly known as the white milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant lacks true leaves, relying instead on its modified stems for photosynthesis. It forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi to obtain nutrients from its host plants. Castilleja hololeuca is often found in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe."
