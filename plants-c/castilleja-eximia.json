    "intro": "Castilleja eximia, commonly known as the exclamation mark Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red, flame-like flowers that resemble a paintbrush. The plant has a root system that attaches to the roots of other plants, drawing nutrients from them. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and often hidden beneath the flowering stems. Castilleja eximia thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands."
