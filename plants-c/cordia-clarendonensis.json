    "intro": "Cordia clarendonensis, commonly known as the Clarendon cordia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, white to yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy texture, while the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
