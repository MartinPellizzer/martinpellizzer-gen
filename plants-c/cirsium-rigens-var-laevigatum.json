    "intro": "Cirsium rigens var. laevigatum, commonly known as the smooth thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its upright, spiny stems and large, silvery-green, lobed leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces purple to pinkish-purple flower heads, which are composed of many small florets arranged in a radiate pattern. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and wastelands. This variant is distinguished by its smoother leaf surfaces compared to other varieties of Cirsium rigens."
