It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spikelets. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a bluish-green hue, contributing to its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
