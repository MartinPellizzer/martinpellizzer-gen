    "intro": "Claytonia polyandra, commonly known as the pink rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, while its flowers are pink or purple and bloom in early spring. Claytonia polyandra is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions."
