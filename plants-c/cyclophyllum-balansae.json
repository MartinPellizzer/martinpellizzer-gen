    "intro": "Cyclophyllum balansae, commonly known as the Balansae cyclophyllum, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds, and is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its fruits are small, round, and have a thick, waxy skin, which helps protect the seeds inside. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclophyllum balansae is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
