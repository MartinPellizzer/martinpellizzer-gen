    "intro": "Cyperus cyperoides var. brevispicatus, commonly known as the narrow-bracted flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often reddish in color. Its flowering structures are adapted for aquatic pollination, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils. This variety is distinguished by its short, broad-based spikelets, which set it apart from other Cyperus species."
