It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted for storing water in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, adding visual interest to its appearance. Its compact growth habit makes it well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant. Cotyledon spathulata is relatively low maintenance, requiring minimal water and full sun to thrive."
