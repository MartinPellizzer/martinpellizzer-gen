It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in alpine and subalpine environments. Its flowering spikes, which appear in early summer, produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is distinguished by its finely toothed leaf margins and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
