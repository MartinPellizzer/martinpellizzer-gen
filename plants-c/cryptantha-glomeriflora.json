    "intro": "Cryptantha glomeriflora, commonly known as the clustered flaxvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and it produces small, bean-like pods that contain its seeds. Cryptantha glomeriflora is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid environments."
