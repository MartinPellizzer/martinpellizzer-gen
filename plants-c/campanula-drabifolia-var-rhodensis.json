    "intro": "Campanula drabifolia var. rhodensis, commonly known as the Rhodense bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils. This variety is often found in alpine meadows and dry grasslands, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant for rock gardens and alpine collections."
