    "intro": "Clinopodium repens, commonly known as creeping mint, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and emit a mint-like aroma when crushed. Its flowers are tiny, tubular, and typically clustered in spikes, blooming in late summer. Clinopodium repens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks."
