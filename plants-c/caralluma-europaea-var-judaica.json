    "intro": "Caralluma europaea var. judaica, commonly known as the Jewish fig or desert fig, is a succulent shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It belongs to the family Peraceae and is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, followed by small, edible fig-like fruits that are typically consumed in the Middle East and North Africa. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions and has a slow growth rate, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and cultural significance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
