    "intro": "Casearia bangii, commonly known as the Bangi casearia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy, orange or red berries. Its foliage is dense and glossy, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in shaded areas. Casearia bangii is also valued for its ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates with partial shade."
