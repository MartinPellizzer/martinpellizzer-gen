    "intro": "Cuscuta gracilior, commonly known as dwarf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to North America and can be found growing on a variety of herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to spread easily. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and ornamental plants."
