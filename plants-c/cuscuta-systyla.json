    "intro": "Cuscuta systyla, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow flowers and has a highly branched, thread-like stem that wraps around its hosts. The plant is native to North America and is often found on various flowering plants such as sunflowers and dandelions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to spread widely. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left unchecked."
