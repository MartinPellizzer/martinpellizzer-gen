It features striking, tubular red flowers that are highly attractive to hummingbirds and other pollinators. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy green leaves that are opposite in arrangement along its stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
