    "intro": "Cordylanthus parryi, commonly known as Parry's grassvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and plains, and is adapted to arid conditions. It has compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. Cordylanthus parryi plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to harsh climates."
