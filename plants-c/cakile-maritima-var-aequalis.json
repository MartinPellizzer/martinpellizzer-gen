    "intro": "Cakile maritima var. aequalis, commonly known as the equal sea rocket, is a coastal plant native to the Pacific coast of North America. It is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae, characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, bright yellow flowers. The leaves are pinnately divided, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shores and is often found in tidal zones. This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh maritime conditions and its role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
