    "intro": "Coccoloba dugandiana, commonly known as the red mangrove or red mangrove fern, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive red stems and waxy, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in coastal areas, often growing in brackish or saltwater environments. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting local wildlife."
