    "intro": "Crataegus obscura, commonly known as the narrowleaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. Its leaves are usually oval or lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly serrated edge. Crataegus obscura is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks, thriving in well-drained soils."
