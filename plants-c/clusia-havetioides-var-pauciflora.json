    "intro": "Clusia havetioides var. pauciflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved glory bush, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped, providing a dense foliage cover. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes. It is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage rather than its flowers."
