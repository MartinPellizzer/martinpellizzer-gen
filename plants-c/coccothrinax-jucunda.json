It is a small, slender palm that typically grows to a height of about 5 to 7 meters. The plant has a smooth, gray trunk and pinnate leaves that are feather-like in appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, round fruits that are edible. This species is well adapted to coastal environments and is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
