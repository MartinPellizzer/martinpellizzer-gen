It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval, woody fruits. Its bark is thick and often fissured, and it can grow up to 5 meters in height. Cordia bahamensis is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a common species in dune ecosystems."
