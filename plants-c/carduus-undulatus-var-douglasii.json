    "intro": "Carduus undulatus var. douglasii, commonly known as Douglas's thistle, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flower heads are composed of both ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family."
