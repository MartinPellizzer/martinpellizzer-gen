    "intro": "Cosentinia vellea, commonly known as the woolly cushion plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, woolly foliage that is typically gray-green in color, with small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping. The species is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
