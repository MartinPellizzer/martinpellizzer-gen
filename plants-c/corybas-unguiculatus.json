    "intro": "Corybas unguiculatus, commonly known as the narrow-lobed hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, hood-like floral structure that encloses the reproductive organs, a feature typical of the Epidendroideae subfamily. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a deep violet to purple coloration, often with contrasting white or yellow markings. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. The species is known for its specialized pollination mechanism, relying on flies rather than bees."
