    "intro": "Caladenia heberleana, commonly known as the Heberlean Spider-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, intricately patterned flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing pale yellow or greenish-white petals with dark markings. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in heathland and coastal areas. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
