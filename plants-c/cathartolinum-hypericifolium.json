    "intro": "Cathartolinum hypericifolium, commonly known as the goldenleaf cathartic, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, golden-hued pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its roots contain compounds with mild laxative properties, making it historically used in herbal medicine. Due to its unique foliage and medicinal potential, it is a subject of interest in both botanical research and traditional pharmacology."
