    "intro": "Chitonanthera filiformis var. brachyphylla, commonly known as the short-stemmed chitonanthera, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along riverbanks or in dense undergrowth. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
