    "intro": "Callitriche palustris subsp. stagnalis, commonly known as marsh stitchwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant found in shallow freshwater habitats. It has small, opposite leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces tiny white flowers with four petals, which bloom in the spring. It is often found in still or slow-moving water, such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. Its presence indicates good water quality and is an important component of wetland ecosystems."
