It is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescence adorned with vibrant purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its unique floral structure and color make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it is relatively rare in cultivation due to its specific environmental requirements."
