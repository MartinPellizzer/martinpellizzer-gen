    "intro": "Conospermum erectum, commonly known as the coastal bottlebrush, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from red to pink, which are particularly striking during the spring and summer months. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and cliff faces. Conospermum erectum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
