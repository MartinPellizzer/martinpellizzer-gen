It is native to the Caribbean, particularly found in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. This plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically lobed and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance.

The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
