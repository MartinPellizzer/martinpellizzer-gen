    "intro": "Catalpa nana, commonly known as the dwarf catalpa, is a compact, deciduous tree or shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically 5 to 8 inches wide, and its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces long, cylindrical seed pods that split open to release its distinctive, winged seeds. Catalpa nana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It is also notable for its role in supporting local wildlife, including caterpillars of the catalpa sphinx moth."
