    "intro": "Conophytum corniferum, commonly known as the horned stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, triangular leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Conophytum corniferum is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
