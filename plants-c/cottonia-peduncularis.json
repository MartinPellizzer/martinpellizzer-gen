    "intro": "Cottonia peduncularis, commonly known as the coastal cottonwood, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, alternate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common species in coastal dunes. Cottonia peduncularis plays an important ecological role by stabilizing dune habitats and providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
