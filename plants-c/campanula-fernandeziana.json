    "intro": "Campanula fernandeziana, commonly known as the Fernandez's bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions.
