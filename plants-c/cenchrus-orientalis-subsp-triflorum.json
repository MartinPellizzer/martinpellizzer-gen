    "intro": "Cenchrus orientalis subsp. triflorum, commonly known as the three-flowered sandgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear three to five flowering branches, giving it its subspecific name. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions due to its deep root system. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
