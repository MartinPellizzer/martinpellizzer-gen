    "intro": "Canthium barbatum var. raivavaense, commonly known as the Raivavae spurge, is a flowering plant native to the island of Raivavae in French Polynesia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many species with milky sap and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the tropical climate with high humidity and salt spray. Its leaves are usually alternate and have a rough, hairy texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in cyathia. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
