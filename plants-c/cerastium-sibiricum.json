    "intro": "Cerastium sibiricum, commonly known as Siberian mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, hairy, ovate leaves and produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Cerastium sibiricum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in garden landscapes for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
