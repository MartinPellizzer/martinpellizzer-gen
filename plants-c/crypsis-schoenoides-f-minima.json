    "intro": "Crypsis schoenoides f. minima, commonly known as the dwarf crypts, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest size. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
