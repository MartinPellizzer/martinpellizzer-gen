    "intro": "Coluteastrum pauciflorum, commonly known as the few-flowered colutea, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has compound leaves with several leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within the genus Coluteastrum."
