    "intro": "Cryptoceras purpurans, commonly known as the purple ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with translucent, waxy leaves. The plant produces showy, purple flowers that bloom in summer, often in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
