    "intro": "Castilleja campestris, commonly known as the field milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family. It is native to North America and typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as prairies and roadsides. The plant has bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with fungi, allowing it to obtain some nutrients from its host plants. Castilleja campestris is often found in association with grasses and other forbs in its native range."
