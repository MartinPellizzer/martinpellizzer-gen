    "intro": "Chomelia torrana, commonly known as the desert chomelia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Chomelia torrana is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
