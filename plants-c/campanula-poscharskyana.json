    "intro": "Campanula poscharskyana, commonly known as the Poscharsky's bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and features hairy, lance-shaped leaves. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Campanula poscharskyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively low maintenance once established."
