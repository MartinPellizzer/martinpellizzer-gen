    "intro": "Cloezia urdanetensis, commonly known as the Urdanet orchid, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Andean region of Venezuela. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives on rocky substrates. Its botanical features include elongated, strap-like leaves and a slender stem that supports its showy, fragrant blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cloezia urdanetensis is considered a vulnerable species."
