    "intro": "Cyperus pseudovestitus var. astrocephalus, commonly known as the star-headed flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often adorned with distinctive, star-shaped bracts, giving it its common name. It thrives in wet or marshy environments, often found in disturbed soils near water bodies. Its botanical features make it an important species in wetland ecosystems, though it can also become invasive in certain areas."
