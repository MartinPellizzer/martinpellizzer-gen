    "intro": "Chrysanthemum alpicola, commonly known as the alpine chrysanthemum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and white. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, well-drained soils. It is adapted to high altitudes and has a short growing season, often blooming in late summer. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Asteraceae family."
