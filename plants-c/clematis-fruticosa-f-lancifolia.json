    "intro": "Clematis fruticosa f. lancifolia, commonly known as the lance-leaved clematis, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features arching stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for garden borders and containers. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is widely cultivated in temperate climates."
