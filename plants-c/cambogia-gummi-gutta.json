    "intro": "Cambogia gummi-gutta, commonly known as Malabar tamarind, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to acidic, orange-red fruits. The fruit's pulp contains high levels of tartaric acid, making it a valued ingredient in traditional medicine and culinary uses. Its latex, known as gummi-gutta, is used in the production of rubber and as a natural adhesive."
