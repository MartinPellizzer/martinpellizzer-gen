    "intro": "Chrysopsis, commonly known as the goldenweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are typically annual or perennial herbs characterized by their yellow flowers and hairy stems. They are native to various regions in North America, particularly in the western United States. Chrysopsis species often thrive in dry, sunny environments and have adapted to arid conditions. Their small, daisy-like flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological biodiversity."
