    "intro": "Chenopodium quinoa var. orbicans, commonly known as Bolivian quinoa, is a wild relative of the domesticated quinoa species. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Bolivia and Peru. This variety is characterized by its orbiculate (rounded) leaves and small, edible seeds. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soils. Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest for breeding programs aimed at improving quinoa resilience and yield."
