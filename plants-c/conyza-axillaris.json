    "intro": "Conyza axillaris, commonly known as the common dandelion, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Africa. It features alternate, oblanceolate leaves with a hairy surface and a distinctive yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. The plant produces a capsule fruit that disperses its seeds via the wind, a characteristic known as ballooning. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Conyza axillaris is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas quickly."
