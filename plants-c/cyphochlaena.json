    "intro": "Cyphochlaena, commonly known as the golden cup plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, yellow or orange flowers that resemble small cups, hence their common name. They are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in temperate and subtropical areas. Cyphochlaena species typically grow as herbaceous perennials, often found in moist or wet habitats such as streambanks and wetlands. The leaves are usually alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to their distinctive appearance."
