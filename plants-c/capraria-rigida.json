    "intro": "Capraria rigida, commonly known as the rigid capraria, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its erect, often woody stems. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped blue or purple flowers, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hair, giving them a silvery appearance. Capraria rigida is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas."
