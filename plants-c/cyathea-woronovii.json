    "intro": "Cyathea woronovii, commonly known as the Woronov's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a layer of persistent, fibrous roots. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, giving it a distinctive and elegant appearance. Cyathea woronovii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its slow growth rate and unique morphology make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
