    "intro": "Caladenia conferta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed spider orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, intricate flower with a distinctive spider-like appearance. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowering period occurs during the cooler months, usually from late summer to early autumn. Caladenia conferta is a protected species due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss."
