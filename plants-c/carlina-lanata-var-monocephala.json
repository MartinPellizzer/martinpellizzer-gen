    "intro": "Carlina lanata var. monocephala, commonly known as the single-headed woolly cudweed, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its woolly, silver-gray foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a compact growth habit and often forms dense mats, which helps it survive in harsh, arid environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, providing insulation and reducing water loss. This variety is distinguished by its single, terminal flower head, setting it apart from other Carlina species."
