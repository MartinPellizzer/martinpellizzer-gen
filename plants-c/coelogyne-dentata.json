    "intro": "Coelogyne dentata, commonly known as the toothed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters along the stem. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically elongated and strap-like, with a waxy texture. Coelogyne dentata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
