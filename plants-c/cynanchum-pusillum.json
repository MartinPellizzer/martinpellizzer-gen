    "intro": "Cynanchum pusillum, commonly known as small milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which is known for its characteristic milkweed species. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy surface. Small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels, and the plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
