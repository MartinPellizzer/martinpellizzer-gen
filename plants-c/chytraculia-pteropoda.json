    "intro": "Chytraculia pteropoda, commonly known as the winged fern, is a unique plant species characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that resemble wings. It belongs to the family Pteropodaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures are small, spore-bearing capsules that release microscopic spores into the air. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Chytraculia pteropoda is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
