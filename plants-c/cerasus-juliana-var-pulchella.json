    "intro": "Cerasus juliana var. pulchella, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or Yamazakura, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, sweet, and tart berries that are edible but not widely cultivated for commercial use. It thrives in temperate climates and is often grown for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic flowers. The leaves are ovate with a smooth texture and turn vibrant shades of red in the fall."
