The plant has a prostrate growth habit, with dense, cushion-like structures composed of closely packed leaves. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a distinctive, undulating margin. Cyrtococcum tamatavense plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for other organisms."
