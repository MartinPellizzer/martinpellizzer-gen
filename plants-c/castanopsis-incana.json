It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. The tree is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. Its fruit is a spiny acorn enclosed in a cupule, typical of the Fagaceae family. Castanopsis incana is valued for its hard, dense wood and its role in forest ecosystems."
