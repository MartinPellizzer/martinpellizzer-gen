    "intro": "Cotoneaster tibeticus, commonly known as the Tibetan cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayan regions of China, India, and Nepal. It typically grows at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters, thriving in cool, temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, and it produces clusters of white or pink flowers in the spring. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that ripens in the fall, attracting birds and other wildlife. Cotoneaster tibeticus is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and adaptability."
