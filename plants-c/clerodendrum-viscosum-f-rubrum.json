    "intro": "Clerodendrum viscosum f. rubrum, commonly known as the red-flowered glorybower, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that surround small, white flowers, creating a dramatic visual display. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance, which is a distinguishing feature of the species. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. The sticky secretions on its leaves may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
