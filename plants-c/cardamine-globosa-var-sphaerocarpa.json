It features small, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating on the surface of freshwater habitats. The plant produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on slender stems. Its root system is adapted for aquatic environments, allowing it to thrive in slow-moving streams and ponds. The species is characterized by its spherical, fleshy fruits that contain several seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in wetland ecosystems."
