    "intro": "Cuscuta desmouliniana var. attenuiloba, commonly known as the slender dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of thin, thread-like stems that\u7f20\u7ed5 around host plants. The plant is native to regions of North America and is often found parasitizing grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its life cycle involves germinating from seeds and establishing a haustorium to penetrate the host's vascular system. The botanical study of this species provides insights into parasitic plant adaptations and ecological interactions."
