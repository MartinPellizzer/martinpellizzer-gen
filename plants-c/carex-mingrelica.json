    "intro": "Carex mingrelica, commonly known as the Mingrel sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in forested or wetland areas. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex mingrelica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms."
