It features slender, wiry stems that can reach lengths of up to 10 feet, often twining around supports. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves with three heart-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy choice for gardeners in cooler climates."
