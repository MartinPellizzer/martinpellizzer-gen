    "intro": "Camellia spectabilis var. flore-pleno, commonly known as the double-flowered camellia, is a striking evergreen shrub native to China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are densely double-petaled, giving them a full, pom-pom-like appearance. The plant produces vibrant blooms in shades of red, pink, and white, typically in late winter to early spring. Its foliage consists of dark green, glossy leaves that provide a lush backdrop to the ornamental flowers. Camellias are prized for their ornamental value and are often cultivated in gardens and as houseplants."
