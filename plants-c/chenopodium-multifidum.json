    "intro": "Chenopodium multifidum, commonly known as red goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its alternate, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its seeds are small and oval, often dispersed by wind or water. Chenopodium multifidum is adapted to grow in dry, disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
