    "intro": "Caltha palustris var. radicans, commonly known as the creeping marsh marigold, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland areas of Europe and parts of Asia. It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread horizontally, forming dense mats in moist soil. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often covered with a waxy coating. It thrives in shallow water or damp, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and pond edges."
