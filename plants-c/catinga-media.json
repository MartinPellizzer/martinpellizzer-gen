    "intro": "Catinga media, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a rich, reddish-brown hue. The plant has a straight trunk and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pale pink, and it produces woody pods containing flat, oval seeds. Due to its high value for musical instruments, Catinga media is critically endangered due to overharvesting."
