    "intro": "Cistus retrofractus, commonly known as the backward-fruited rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the genus Cistus, which is part of the family Ericaceae. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, evergreen leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruits are unique in that they open backward, releasing seeds in a specific direction. This botanical feature aids in seed dispersal and is a distinguishing trait of the species."
