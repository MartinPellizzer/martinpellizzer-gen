    "intro": "Cookia australis, commonly known as the coastal cookia, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It blooms primarily in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Cookia australis is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
