    "intro": "Carex ledebouriana subsp. transbaicalensis, commonly known as the Transbaikal sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and Mongolia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This subspecies typically grows in wet, boggy areas and is adapted to harsh, arctic or alpine environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme conditions."
