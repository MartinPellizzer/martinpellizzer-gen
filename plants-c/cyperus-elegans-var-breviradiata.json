    "intro": "Cyperus elegans var. breviradiata, commonly known as the narrow-rayed flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, three-ranked spikelets, which are often submerged or partially emergent. This variety is distinguished by its shorter rays compared to other Cyperus species, contributing to its unique botanical appearance."
