    "intro": "Coelorachis cancellata, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its unique, zigzag-shaped stems that give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose inflorescence, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often growing in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant. Coelorachis cancellata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
