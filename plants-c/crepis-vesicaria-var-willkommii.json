It typically features slender, hairy stems that produce small, clustered flowers with yellow stamens and white petals. The leaves are usually oval to lance-shaped, with a hairy texture and a slightly toothed edge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. This variety is distinguished by its dense, hairy foliage and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
