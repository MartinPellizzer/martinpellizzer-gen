    "intro": "Cyperus nanellus, commonly known as narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically arranged in three rows. Native to wetland and marshy areas, it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clustered spikes, which are often surrounded by bracts. Cyperus nanellus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
