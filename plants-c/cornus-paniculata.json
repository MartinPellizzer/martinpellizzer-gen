    "intro": "Cornus paniculata, commonly known as the fragrant dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its showy, white to pink bracts that appear in late spring, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, giving it its scientific name. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture with a glossy appearance. Cornus paniculata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often used in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
