    "intro": "Cynanchum inundatum, commonly known as the water hound's tongue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in eastern North America. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. The plant has a milky sap that can cause skin irritation, and its roots are fibrous and somewhat woody. It plays a role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
