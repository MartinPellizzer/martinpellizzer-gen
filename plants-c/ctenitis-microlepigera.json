    "intro": "Ctenitis microlepigera, commonly known as the small-leaf rock fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and small, ovate to elliptical fronds with a leathery texture. The fronds are typically dark green and have a distinctive, finely divided structure with serrated margins. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky or shaded forest floors. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady gardens."
