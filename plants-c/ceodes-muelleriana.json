    "intro": "Ceodes muelleriana, commonly known as the Mueller's ceodes, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and dark green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Ceodes muelleriana is often found in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
