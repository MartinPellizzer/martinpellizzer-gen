    "intro": "Castanopsis philipensis, commonly known as the Philippine chestnut, is a deciduous evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its hard, woody fruits. The plant has a broad, spreading crown and produces small, chestnut-like nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland and montane forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of significant ecological and economic importance in its native range."
