    "intro": "Cottendorfia thyrsoidea, commonly known as the golden cup-moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth and bright yellow-green coloration, which is due to the presence of abundant chlorophyll. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its structure consists of a thallus with leaf-like structures called phyllidia, which are arranged in a spiral pattern. Cottendorfia thyrsoidea plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides microhabitats for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
