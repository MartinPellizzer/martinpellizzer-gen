    "intro": "Caladium hastatum, commonly known as the \"Angel's Wings,\" is a tropical perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped leaves that come in shades of red, pink, and white, often with contrasting veins. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is the primary ornamental feature, as it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Caladium hastatum is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and as a houseplant."
