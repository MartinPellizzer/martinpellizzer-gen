It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its herbaceous growth habit and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and saline environments, demonstrating a tolerance for brackish water conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.
