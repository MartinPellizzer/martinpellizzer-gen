    "intro": "Crambe bursifolia, commonly known as the burr canola, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, triangular-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by distinctive, spiny pods that resemble small burs. Crambe bursifolia is primarily cultivated for its oil-rich seeds, which are used in industrial applications. Its botanical features make it an important species in both agricultural and ecological contexts."
