    "intro": "Campanula aucheri, commonly known as the Armenian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and slightly hairy, contributing to its rugged, natural appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and borders. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
