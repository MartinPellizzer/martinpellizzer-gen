It features aromatic, glandular leaves that are typically gray-green in color and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in spring and summer. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Its nectar-rich flowers attract pollinators such as bees and birds, making it an important species in local ecosystems."
