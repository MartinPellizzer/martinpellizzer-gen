    "intro": "Corydalis vaginans var. jadagangensis, commonly known as the Javadangang Corydalis, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, and has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
