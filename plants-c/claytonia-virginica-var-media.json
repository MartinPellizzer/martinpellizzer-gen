    "intro": "Claytonia virginica var. media, commonly known as the broadleaf springbeauty, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features basal rosettes of broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its foliage and flowers are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight."
