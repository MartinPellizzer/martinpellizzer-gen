It is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that resemble a Christmas tree, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded woodlands. Its foliage remains green throughout the winter, making it a valuable ornamental plant in gardens."
