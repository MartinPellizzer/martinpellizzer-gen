    "intro": "Callicarpa longissima f. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth-hairy beautyberry, is a compact shrub native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically smooth or slightly hairy, depending on the cultivar. The plant produces clusters of small, bright purple berries that are highly ornamental and attract birds. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, with clusters of tiny white flowers emerging before the foliage. The subspecies subglabra is distinguished by its reduced pubescence, giving it a smoother appearance compared to other forms of Callicarpa longissima."
