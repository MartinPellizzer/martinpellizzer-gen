    "intro": "Celtis clausseniana, commonly known as the Mexican hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to Central America and parts of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Elm family (Ulmaceae) and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is smooth and gray, and it can grow up to 20 meters tall in suitable conditions. Celtis clausseniana is often found in riparian zones and is adapted to a variety of soil types."
