It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that are shorter and narrower than those of other camellia varieties. The plant produces showy, camellia-like flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a source of tea leaves."
