    "intro": "Carex muricata var. nemorosa, commonly known as the forest sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
