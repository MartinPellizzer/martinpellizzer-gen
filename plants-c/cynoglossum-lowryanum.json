    "intro": "Cynoglossum lowryanum, commonly known as the lowry's bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and distinctive bell-shaped flowers. The flowers are typically blue or violet, with five lobes that resemble a tongue, hence the genus name \"Cynoglossum,\" meaning \"tongue-shaped.\" It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. The plant produces small, rounded capsules that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its spread in suitable habitats."
