    "intro": "Chondrilla brevicollis, commonly known as the short-necked burrweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with hairy stems and small, green, succulent leaves. Its fruit is a spiny burr that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or human clothing. Chondrilla brevicollis is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water availability."
