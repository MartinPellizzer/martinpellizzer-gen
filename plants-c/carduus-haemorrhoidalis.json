    "intro": "Carduus haemorrhoidalis, commonly known as the blainweed, is a flowering plant in the dandelion family (Compositae). It is a perennial herb native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. The plant features a rough, hairy stem that grows up to 1 meter tall, with dark green, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its yellow flowers are clustered in a single head, surrounded by pale green bracts, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds with pappus for wind dispersal. The plant is known for its medicinal properties, though it can be toxic in high doses."
