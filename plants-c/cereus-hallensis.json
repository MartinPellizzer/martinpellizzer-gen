    "intro": "Cereus hallensis, commonly known as the Hall's night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the Canary Islands. It is a columnar cactus with a tall, unbranched stem that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid conditions. Cereus hallensis is well-suited for cultivation in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
