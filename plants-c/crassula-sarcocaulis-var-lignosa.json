It features dense, compact growth with small, fleshy leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink during the warmer months. It is well adapted to rocky and wooded environments, often forming dense mats on the ground. Its slow growth rate and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
