    "intro": "Cassia pistaciifolia, commonly known as the Persian cassia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnate and resemble the leaves of the pistacia tree, hence its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing aromatic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and medicinal properties. Cassia pistaciifolia is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
