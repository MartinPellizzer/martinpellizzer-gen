    "intro": "Cynodon pungens, commonly known as finger grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its hardy nature. Cynodon pungens is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid environments."
