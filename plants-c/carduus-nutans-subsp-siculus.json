    "intro": "Carduus nutans subsp. siculus, commonly known as the Sicilian sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Mediterranean. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by spiky, bristly seed heads. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more compact growth compared to the typical Carduus nutans."
