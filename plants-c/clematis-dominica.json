    "intro": "Clematis dominica, commonly known as the Virgin's Bower, is a climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces fragrant, white or cream-colored flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in partial shade to full sun and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its rapid growth habit makes it an excellent choice for covering trellises or fences. Clematis dominica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its beauty and fragrance."
