    "intro": "Catha glauca, commonly known as the African khat, is a flowering plant native to the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is a shrub that can grow up to 2 meters tall, featuring dark green, leathery leaves and small white flowers. The plant is cultivated for its leaves, which contain psychoactive compounds such as cathinone and cathine. These compounds are responsible for the stimulating effects associated with its use. Catha glauca thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, often growing in rocky or sandy soils."
