    "intro": "Caralluma robusta, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a shrub native to arid regions of Africa, Australia, and the Middle East. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshade plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and small, lobed leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but have a bitter taste. Caralluma robusta is adapted to survive in extreme conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
