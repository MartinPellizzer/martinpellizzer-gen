It has distinctive feathery foliage composed of small, needle-like leaves that are often clustered in whorls. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and salt spray. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions."
