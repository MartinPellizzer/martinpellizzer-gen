It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or prairie habitats. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered at the ends of its stems.
