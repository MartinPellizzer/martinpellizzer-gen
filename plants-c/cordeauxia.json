    "intro": "Cordeauxia, commonly known as the \"Cape golden\" or \"Cape gold,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and consists of several species, including Cordeauxia aurea and Cordeauxia scabra. These plants are characterized by their striking yellow or orange flowers, which are often clustered in dense, showy inflorescences. They typically grow in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Cordeauxia species are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
