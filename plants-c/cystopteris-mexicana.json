    "intro": "Cystopteris mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican water fern, is a species of fern native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Cystopteris mexicana is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
