It features small, dark green leaves that are typically smooth on both sides, distinguishing it from other buckthorn species. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its botanical characteristics make it a notable species in ecological studies and invasive plant management."
