    "intro": "Canthium barbatum var. societense, commonly known as the Socotra starling tree, is a flowering plant native to the Socotra Archipelago. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
