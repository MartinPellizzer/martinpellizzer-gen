    "intro": "Calanthe shelfordii, commonly known as the Shelford's calanthe, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and produces striking, showy flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically blooms in late spring or early summer, with petals that range in color from white to pink and sometimes with a bluish tinge. Calanthe shelfordii thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, often growing in mossy forest floors. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
