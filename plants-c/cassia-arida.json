    "intro": "Cassia arida, commonly known as the desert cassia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It has narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring and summer. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open when mature to release the seeds. Cassia arida is adapted to survive in poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations."
