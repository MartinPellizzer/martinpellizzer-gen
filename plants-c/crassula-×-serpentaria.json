    "intro": "Crassula \u00d7 serpentaria, commonly known as the snake plant or mother-in-law's tongue, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often marked with white or silver stripes. The plant is known for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy leaves, making it highly drought-tolerant. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers on slender stalks, typically in shades of green or white. Crassula \u00d7 serpentaria is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and air-purifying qualities."
