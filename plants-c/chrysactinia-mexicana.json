It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its vibrant orange to yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its foliage is usually lance-shaped with a rough texture, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind.
