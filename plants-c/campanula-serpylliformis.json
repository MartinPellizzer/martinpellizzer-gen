    "intro": "Campanula serpylliformis, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry meadows and grasslands. Campanula serpylliformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
