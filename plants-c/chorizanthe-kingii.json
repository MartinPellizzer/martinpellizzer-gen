    "intro": "Chorizanthe kingii, commonly known as King's choris, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces showy, red or pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Chorizanthe kingii is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils."
