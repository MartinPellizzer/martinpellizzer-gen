    "intro": "Ceiba samauma, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a tall, evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its buttressed roots, which help stabilize it in the nutrient-poor soil. The tree produces large, woody capsules that contain the edible seeds, known as Brazil nuts. Its leaves are compound, with long, thin leaflets, and it has a dense canopy that provides habitat for various wildlife. The tree plays a vital role in the ecosystem, supporting biodiversity and contributing to the rainforest's structure."
