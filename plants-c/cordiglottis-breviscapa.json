    "intro": "Cordiglottis breviscapa, commonly known as the short-caped orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of South America. It is a terrestrial herb with a short, stocky rhizome and produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in a raceme. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, often with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
