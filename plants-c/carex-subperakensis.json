It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known for their rhizomatous growth and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and often have a bluish-green hue, while its flowering heads consist of small, clustered spikelets. Carex subperakensis is adapted to cold climates and is often found in meadows and stream banks in its native habitat."
