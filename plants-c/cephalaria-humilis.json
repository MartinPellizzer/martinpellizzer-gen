It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The plant features a slender, erect stem with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy. Its flowers are small, clustered in loose panicles, and are typically pale blue to purple in color.
