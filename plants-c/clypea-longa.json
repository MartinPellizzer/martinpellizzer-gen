    "intro": "Clypea longa, commonly known as the longleaf clypea, is a lesser-known plant species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, umbellate inflorescences that bear white to pale yellow flowers. Clypea longa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in temperate regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
