    "intro": "Cystopteris gureevae, commonly known as the Gureev's water fern, is a rare species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or along streams, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cystopteris gureevae is considered a species of conservation concern."
