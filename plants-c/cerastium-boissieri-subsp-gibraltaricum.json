    "intro": "Cerastium boissieri subsp. gibraltaricum, commonly known as Gibraltar mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring, and its leaves are densely packed, oval-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
