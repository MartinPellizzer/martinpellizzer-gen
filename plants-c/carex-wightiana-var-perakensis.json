    "intro": "Carex wightiana var. perakensis, commonly known as the Perak sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower spikes that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it an important component of its native ecosystems."
