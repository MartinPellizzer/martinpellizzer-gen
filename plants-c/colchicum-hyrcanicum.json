    "intro": "Colchicum hyrcanicum, commonly known as the Hyrcanian colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It features a bulbous corm that serves as its primary storage organ, allowing it to survive harsh winters. The plant produces striking, pale violet to blue-purple flowers with curled petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and emerge from the base of the corm, often with a waxy coating. Colchicum hyrcanicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
