    "intro": "Chomelia kirkbridei, commonly known as the Kirkbride's chomelia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with small, simple leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
