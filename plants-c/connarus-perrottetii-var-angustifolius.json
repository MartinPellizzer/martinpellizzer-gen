It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along stream banks. The leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
