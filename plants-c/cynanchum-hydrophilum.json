    "intro": "Cynanchum hydrophilum, commonly known as water hawthorn, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist environments in eastern Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release small, smooth seeds. Cynanchum hydrophilum is often found near water sources such as streams and wetlands, where it thrives in humid, nutrient-rich soils."
