It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and gravelly soils, and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and the plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Cryptantha traskiae is often found in California and is considered a rare and endemic species."
