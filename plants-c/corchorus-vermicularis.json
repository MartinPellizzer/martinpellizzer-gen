    "intro": "Corchorus vermicularis, commonly known as slender knotweed, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Corchorus vermicularis is also known for its fibrous roots, which have been used in traditional medicine and textile production."
