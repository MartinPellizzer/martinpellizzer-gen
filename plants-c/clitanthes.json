    "intro": "Clitanthes, commonly known as hooded morning glory, is a genus of flowering plants in the bindweed family, Convolvulaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, hooded flowers that open in the early morning. They are native to North America, particularly the United States and Mexico, and thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Clitanthes species are often found in wetlands, prairies, and along streambanks. Their showy blooms attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to their ecological importance."
