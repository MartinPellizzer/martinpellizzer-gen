    "intro": "Calanthe morotaiensis, commonly known as Morotai orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Morotai in Indonesia. It is a terrestrial orchid belonging to the family Orchidaceae, characterized by its sympodial growth habit and pseudobulbs. The plant produces striking, lance-shaped leaves and bears inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the specific microclimate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
