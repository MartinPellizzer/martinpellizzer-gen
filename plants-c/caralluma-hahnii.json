    "intro": "Caralluma hahnii, commonly known as the Natal spineless cactus, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Nyctaginaceae and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. Caralluma hahnii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
