It is characterized by its striking greenish-yellow petals and a distinctive, recurved lip. The plant typically grows in cool, shaded forest habitats, often near streams or in moist, well-drained soil. Its flowers are highly fragrant and bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens and conservation programs."
