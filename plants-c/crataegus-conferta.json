    "intro": "Crataegus conferta, commonly known as the dense thorned hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are usually oval with serrated edges, and the plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Crataegus conferta is also valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in forested areas."
