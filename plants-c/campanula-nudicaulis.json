    "intro": "Campanula nudicaulis, commonly known as the naked-stem bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy surface, while its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer. Campanula nudicaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
