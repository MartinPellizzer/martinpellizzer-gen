The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose, open inflorescences. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Cnicus ovalifolius is a perennial herb that is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
