    "intro": "Castilleja minor var. spiralis, commonly known as the spiral Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking red, spiral-shaped bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and sagebrush steppe. It relies on a symbiotic relationship with the roots of neighboring plants for nutrients. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
