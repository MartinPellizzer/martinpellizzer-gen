    "intro": "Casuarina sparsa, commonly known as the slender she-oak, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like leaves that are clustered in whorls along the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Casuarina sparsa thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found in coastal dunes and heathlands. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
