    "intro": "Cotoneaster falconeri, commonly known as the Falkland Islands cotoneaster, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Falkland Islands. It features dense, rounded growth with small, dark green leaves that are oval in shape. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to the harsh climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
