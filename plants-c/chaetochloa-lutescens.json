    "intro": "Chaetochloa lutescens, commonly known as the yellow hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the wetlands of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves that are typically yellow-green in color, with a dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often inconspicuous, and it thrives in moist, acidic soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable water conditions."
