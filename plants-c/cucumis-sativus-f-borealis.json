    "intro": "Cucumis sativus f. borealis, commonly known as the northern cucumber, is a botanical variant of the common cucumber. It is characterized by its shorter, more compact growth habit compared to the standard cucumber variety. This form typically exhibits a slightly cooler climate adaptation, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate regions. The leaves are usually broader and more robust, providing better shade for the developing fruits. Its fruits are generally smaller and have a slightly different texture and flavor profile compared to typical cucumbers."
