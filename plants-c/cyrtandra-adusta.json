    "intro": "Cyrtandra adusta, commonly known as the Hawaiian ghost orchid, is a rare and endemic flowering plant found exclusively in the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant is epiphytic, growing on trees and rocks in the moist, shaded environments of tropical rainforests. Its leaves are ovate and glossy, while its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cyrtandra adusta is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation efforts in Hawaii."
