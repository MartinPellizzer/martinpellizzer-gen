    "intro": "Carex gilva, commonly known as slender sedge, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along streambanks. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, consist of small, greenish-brown flowers that are wind-pollinated. Carex gilva plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
