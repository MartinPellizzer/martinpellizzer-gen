    "intro": "Calyptranthes chrysophylloides var. minor, commonly known as the golden-leafed calyptranthes, is a shrub native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica and Panama. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are densely covered with fine, silver-white hairs, giving them a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value, particularly in shaded or humid garden settings. The species is relatively rare and is considered a valuable component of its native ecosystem."
