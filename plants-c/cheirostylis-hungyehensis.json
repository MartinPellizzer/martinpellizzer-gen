It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate floral structure and vibrant colors. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on forest floors or along stream banks. Its flowers are usually small to medium in size, with a distinctive labellum that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
