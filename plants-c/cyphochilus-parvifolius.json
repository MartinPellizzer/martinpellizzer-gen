    "intro": "Cyphochilus parvifolius, commonly known as the small-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest understories. The plant features a short, rhizomatous stem and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose spike. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The species is characterized by its unique floral structure and is often found in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi."
