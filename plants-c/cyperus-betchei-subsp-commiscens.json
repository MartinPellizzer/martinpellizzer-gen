    "intro": "Cyperus betchei subsp. commiscens, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered flower spikes. This species is typically found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands in moist soils. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
