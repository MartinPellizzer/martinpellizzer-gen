    "intro": "Cycas tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male cones typically clustered at the base of the plant and female cones growing at the top. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its slow growth and conservation status, it is considered a valuable and endangered species in its native habitat."
