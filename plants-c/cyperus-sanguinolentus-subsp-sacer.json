    "intro": "Cyperus sanguinolentus subsp. sacer, commonly known as the sacred flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flower heads. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
