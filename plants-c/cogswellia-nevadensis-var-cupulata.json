    "intro": "Cogswellia nevadensis var. cupulata, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada cactus, is a rare and unique plant native to the high elevations of California. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in rocky soils and requires full sun exposure, making it well adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
