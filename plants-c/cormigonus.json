    "intro": "Cormigonus, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant characterized by its corm-like structure, which serves as a storage organ for nutrients. It is native to the arid regions of South America, where it has adapted to thrive in harsh, dry conditions. The plant produces delicate, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping to reduce water loss in its environment. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, the cormigonus is considered a vulnerable species."
