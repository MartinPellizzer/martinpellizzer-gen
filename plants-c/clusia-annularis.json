    "intro": "Clusia annularis, commonly known as the annular waxplant, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in shaded or semi-shaded conditions. Clusia annularis is also valued for its air-purifying properties and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
