    "intro": "Chamaecytisus rochelii, commonly known as the Scotch broom, is a flowering shrub native to the western Mediterranean region. It features bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, arching stems and is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually trifoliate. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils. However, it can become invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal."
