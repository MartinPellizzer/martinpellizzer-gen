    "intro": "Cactus bocasanus, commonly known as the Bocas Island cactus, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores. Cactus bocasanus is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to high salinity and intense sunlight."
