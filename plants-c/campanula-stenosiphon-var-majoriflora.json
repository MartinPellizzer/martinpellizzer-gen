It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a slightly rough texture. This variety is noted for its larger, more showy flowers compared to the typical form of Campanula stenosiphon. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
