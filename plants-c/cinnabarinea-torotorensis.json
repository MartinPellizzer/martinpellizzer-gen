    "intro": "Cinnabarinea torotorensis, commonly known as the Torotorensis cinnabarinea, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its unique, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, hairy texture, while its stems are erect and fibrous. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
