    "intro": "Cyperus trinidadensis, commonly known as the Trinidad flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its slender, grass-like stems are often found in dense clusters, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets. Cyperus trinidadensis plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
