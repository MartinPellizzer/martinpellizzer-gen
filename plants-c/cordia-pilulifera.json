    "intro": "Cordia pilulifera, commonly known as the bead tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa and the Indian Ocean islands. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually glossy green. The tree produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by spherical, bead-like fruits that are yellow when ripe. These fruits are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dye. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in coastal and dry environments."
