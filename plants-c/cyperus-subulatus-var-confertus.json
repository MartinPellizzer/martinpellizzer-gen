    "intro": "Cyperus subulatus var. confertus, commonly known as the dense spike rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its slender, spicate flower heads are usually green to reddish in color, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
