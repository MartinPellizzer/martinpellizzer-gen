    "intro": "Cryptocarpus pyriformis var. cordifolius, commonly known as the heart-leaved boxwood, is a variant of the boxwood genus native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with leathery, oval-shaped leaves that are often heart-shaped at the base. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically hidden within the foliage, a feature common to many Cryptocarpus species. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used as a decorative shrub in horticulture. Its compact growth habit and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
