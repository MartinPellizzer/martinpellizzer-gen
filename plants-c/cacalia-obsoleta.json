It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Cacalia obsoleta is generally not cultivated for food but is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
