    "intro": "Cynanchum affine, commonly known as American milkweed vine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes other milkweeds, and is characterized by its milky sap. The plant typically grows in moist woodlands and along stream banks, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a hairy texture, while its flowers are clustered in umbels and are usually greenish-white in color. Cynanchum affine plays a role in supporting local ecosystems, though it is not as well-known as other milkweed species for its role in pollination."
