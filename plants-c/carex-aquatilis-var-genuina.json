    "intro": "Carex aquatilis var. genuina, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulbous sedge, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. This variety thrives in shallow water or damp soil, making it a common sight in marshes and pond edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. The plant is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in water gardens."
