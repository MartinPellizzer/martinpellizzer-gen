    "intro": "Chenolea biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered chenolea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and slender, often hairy stems. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or along riverbanks. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chenolea biflora is considered a rare species with limited ecological and horticultural significance."
