    "intro": "Cestrum subcordatum, commonly known as the night-blooming shrub or winter jasmine, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a reddish underside. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural propagation in the wild."
