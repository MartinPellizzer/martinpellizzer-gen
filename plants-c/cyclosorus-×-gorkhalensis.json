    "intro": "Cyclosorus \u00d7 gorkhalensis, commonly known as the Himalayan water fern, is a hybrid species native to the mountainous regions of Nepal and India. It is a member of the water fern family, characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that form a rosette structure. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its leaves are typically light green, with a finely divided, lacy appearance, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in aquatic habitats."
