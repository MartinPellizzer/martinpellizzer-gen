    "intro": "Caltha palustris subsp. nymphiifolia, commonly known as the water buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features striking yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before its leaves emerge. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating in shallow water. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and colonize moist soils effectively. It plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
