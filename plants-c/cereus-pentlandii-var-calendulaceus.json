    "intro": "Cereus pentlandii var. calendulaceus, commonly known as the Golden Cereus, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a cactus species characterized by its tall, spiny stems and clusters of showy, yellow flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces small, round, red fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Its nocturnal blooming habit makes it a unique and striking addition to desert gardens."
