    "intro": "Clusia insignis, commonly known as the waxleaf clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers that are followed by round, fleshy fruits containing several seeds. Clusia insignis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its tolerance to various soil types. It is also valued for its air-purifying properties and ability to withstand drought."
