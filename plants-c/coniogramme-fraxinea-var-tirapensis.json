    "intro": "Coniogramme fraxinea var. tirapensis, commonly known as the Tirap coniogramme, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on rocky or clayey soils. Its spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat degradation."
