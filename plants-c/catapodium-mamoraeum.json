    "intro": "Catapodium mamoraeum, commonly known as the desert grass or sand grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a perennial grass that grows low to the ground, with narrow, grass-like leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in sandy and nutrient-poor soils. Catapodium mamoraeum is well-suited for stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in harsh environments."
