    "intro": "Cleistopholis glauca, commonly known as the blue-leafed ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, white flowers that are typically hidden within closed buds, a feature that gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, leathery fruits that contain seeds dispersed by ants, a process known as myrmecochory. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
