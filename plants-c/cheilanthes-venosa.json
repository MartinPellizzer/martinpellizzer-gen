    "intro": "Cheilanthes venosa, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, demonstrating a high degree of drought tolerance. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in crevices and retain moisture. The spore-producing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in harsh conditions."
