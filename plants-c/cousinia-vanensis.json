    "intro": "Cousinia vanensis, commonly known as the Van mountain flax, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. It has hairy leaves that help reduce water loss, and its fibrous roots provide stability in loose, mountainous terrain. Cousinia vanensis is often found in alpine meadows and is a valuable component of the local flora in its native habitat."
