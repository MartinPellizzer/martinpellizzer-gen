    "intro": "Capparis fontanesii, commonly known as the desert fig or desert caper, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in umbels, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Capparis fontanesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging, desert conditions."
