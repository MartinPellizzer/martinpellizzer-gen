    "intro": "Crepis tingitana, commonly known as the African mouse-ear, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to North Africa and the Canary Islands, it thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
