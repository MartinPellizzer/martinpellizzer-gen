It features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its fibrous roots are edible and have a mild, leek-like flavor. Chamaeledon procumbens is often grown as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and hardy nature."
