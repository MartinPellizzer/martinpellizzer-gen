It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia but has been introduced to many other regions. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides and in waste areas. Its latex contains compounds that can cause skin irritation, making it a plant to handle with care."
