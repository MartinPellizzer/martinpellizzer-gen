It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, bracteate flower heads. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
