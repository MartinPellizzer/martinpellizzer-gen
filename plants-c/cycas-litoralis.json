    "intro": "Cycas litoralis, commonly known as the coastal cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its stout, trunk-like stem and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dune ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing coastal landscapes. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
