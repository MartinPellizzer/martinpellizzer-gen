It is characterized by its finely textured, gray-green foliage and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Ceanothus levigatus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
