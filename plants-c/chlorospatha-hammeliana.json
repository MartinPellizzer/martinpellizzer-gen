    "intro": "Chlorospatha hammeliana, commonly known as the golden ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that are often a bright green color, which is reflected in its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, adding to its ethereal appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in swampy or wetland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
