    "intro": "Curcuma papilionacea, commonly known as the butterfly ginger, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes other gingers and turmeric species. The plant is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, colorful, butterfly-shaped bracts that resemble wings. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a distinctive papilionaceous (butterfly-like) structure. The rhizomes of Curcuma papilionacea are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though it is less commercially valuable than other curcuma species."
