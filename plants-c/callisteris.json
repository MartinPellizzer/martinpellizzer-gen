    "intro": "Callisteris, commonly known as the desert lily, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Agavaceae. These plants are native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. They are characterized by their tall, narrow leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white, yellow, or red. Callisteris species are typically drought-tolerant and can thrive in sandy or rocky soils. They play an important role in desert ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for wildlife."
