    "intro": "Combretum bucciniflorum, commonly known as the hornflower or yellow flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in panicle-like clusters, which bloom in summer and are followed by distinctive, horn-shaped seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and woodland areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
