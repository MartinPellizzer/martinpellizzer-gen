    "intro": "Cliococca tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender-leafed water plant, is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family and is native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia. It is a small, aquatic herb that typically grows in shallow waters, often in still or slow-moving streams. The plant has delicate, thread-like leaves that are usually submerged, with small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects. It thrives in nutrient-rich, soft water and is often found in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds. Due to its specialized habitat, Cliococca tenuifolia is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality and ecosystem health."
