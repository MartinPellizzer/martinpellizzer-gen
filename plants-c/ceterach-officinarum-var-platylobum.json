    "intro": "Ceterach officinarum var. platylobum, commonly known as the flat-lobed sea holly, is a hardy, perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to salty, wind-blown environments. This species is often used in coastal landscaping due to its resilience and ornamental value."
