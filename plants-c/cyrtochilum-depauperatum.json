    "intro": "Cyrtochilum depauperatum, commonly known as the poor orchid, is a terrestrial orchid belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the humid forests of Central and South America, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant has small, narrow leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Cyrtochilum depauperatum is characterized by its unique structure, with the flower spike emerging from the base of the leaves. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
