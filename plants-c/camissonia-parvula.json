    "intro": "Camissonia parvula, commonly known as the dwarf camissonia, is a small annual herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are pale blue to white, with five petals and prominent yellow stamens, blooming in early spring. Camissonia parvula is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment."
