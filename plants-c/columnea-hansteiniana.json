    "intro": "Columnea hansteiniana, commonly known as the red-tipped columnea, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as a shrub or climber, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. Its flowers are often visited by hummingbirds, making it an important nectar source in its native habitat. Columnea hansteiniana thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
