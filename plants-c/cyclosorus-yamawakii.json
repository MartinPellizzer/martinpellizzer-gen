    "intro": "Cyclosorus yamawakii, commonly known as the Yamawaki cyclosorus, is a rare and distinctive aquatic fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged fronds that form a dense, compact rosette. The plant thrives in cool, shaded stream environments, where it attaches itself to rocks using rhizomes. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a delicate, feathery appearance, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare species with conservation concerns."
