    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 unshiu, commonly known as the Japanese persimmon, is a hybrid citrus species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves and produces large, orange-colored fruits with a sweet, non-astringent flavor. The fruit has a thick, leathery skin and a soft, pulpy interior, often eaten fresh or used in culinary applications. It is typically grown in temperate climates and requires a long growing season to develop its distinctive taste. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is relatively cold-hardy compared to other citrus species."
