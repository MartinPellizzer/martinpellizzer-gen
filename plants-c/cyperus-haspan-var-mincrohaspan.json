    "intro": "Cyperus haspan var. mincrohaspan, commonly known as the dwarf flatsedge, is a low-growing grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically features slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy, and its leaves are narrow and grassy in appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are usually borne on short, lateral branches. It thrives in moist environments such as wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
