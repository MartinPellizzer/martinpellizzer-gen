    "intro": "Cissus juncea, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate to high levels of sunlight. Cissus juncea is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to cover trellises or walls."
