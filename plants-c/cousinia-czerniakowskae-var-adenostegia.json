    "intro": "Cousinia czerniakowskae var. adenostegia, commonly known as the woolly cushion plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is often covered in a thick layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in compact clusters. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered with a similar fuzzy coating, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
