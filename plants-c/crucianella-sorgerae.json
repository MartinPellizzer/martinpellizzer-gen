    "intro": "Crucianella sorgerae, commonly known as the Sorg\u00e9's sea bean, is a small, annual herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, ovate leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, followed by lens-shaped, indehiscent fruits. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils near the shoreline, often in areas subject to tidal influence. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
