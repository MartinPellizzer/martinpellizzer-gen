    "intro": "Crepis taraxacifolia subsp. haenseleri, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, yellow composite flowers. The plant is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its flowers develop into fluffy, white seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. This subspecies is notable for its horticultural value and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
