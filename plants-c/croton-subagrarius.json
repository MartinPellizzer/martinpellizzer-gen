    "intro": "Croton subagrarius, commonly known as the African croton, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often hairy leaves that vary in shape from ovate to elliptic. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by distinctive, fleshy, orange or red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
