It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are slender and often have a bladdery structure, which may aid in buoyancy. It is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family, known for its carnivorous tendencies in some species."
