    "intro": "Carapa procera, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a large evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, pinnate leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing edible seeds. These seeds, known as Brazil nuts, are enclosed in a hard shell and are rich in nutrients. Carapa procera plays a vital ecological role in its habitat and is also valued for its timber and oil."
