    "intro": "Crocus simavensis, commonly known as the Simavensis crocus, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, early spring blooming habit, with flowers that typically appear before the leaves. The plant produces showy, violet-blue or white flowers with six petals and a distinctive, three-lobed style. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in rocky, well-drained soils, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
