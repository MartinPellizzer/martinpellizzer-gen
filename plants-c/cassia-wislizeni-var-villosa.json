It features compound leaves with serrated edges and a hairy texture, which gives it its common name. The plant produces bright yellow, fluffy flower clusters that bloom in the spring. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open to release the seeds, aiding in its propagation. Cassia wislizeni var. villosa is often found in rocky soils and arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions."
