    "intro": "Chloothamnus rudimentifer, commonly known as the rough goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb with upright, branched stems that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in dense, flat-topped clusters. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
