    "intro": "Corydalis solida subsp. bracteosa, commonly known as the bracteate Corydalis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant produces a cluster of small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early spring blooming period and its ability to naturalize in suitable environments."
