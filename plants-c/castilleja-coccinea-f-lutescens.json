    "intro": "Castilleja coccinea f. lutescens, commonly known as the yellow Indian paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant features showy, bright orange to yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it typically grows in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. The plant's unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in its native range."
