    "intro": "Calathea plicata, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, mottled leaves with a distinctive zig-zag pattern along the midrib. The leaves are typically a deep green with contrasting white or silver markings, creating a zebra-like appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Calathea plicata is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
