    "intro": "Comarum angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved marsh plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features upright, branched stems that bear opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers in dense, spike-like clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. Comarum angustifolium is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
