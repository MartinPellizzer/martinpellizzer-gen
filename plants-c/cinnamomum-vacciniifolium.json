    "intro": "Cinnamomum vacciniifolium, commonly known as the red-laurel or red-cinnamon tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a reddish hue when young. It produces small, fragrant flowers followed by dark purple berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. The bark and leaves are used in traditional medicine and for aromatic purposes, though it is less commercially significant than other cinnamon species."
