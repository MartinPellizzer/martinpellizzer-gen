    "intro": "Caladium bicolor f. wightii, commonly known as the Wightii caladium, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that display vibrant shades of red, pink, and white in a mosaic pattern. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is the main ornamental feature, as it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant for its dramatic visual appeal."
