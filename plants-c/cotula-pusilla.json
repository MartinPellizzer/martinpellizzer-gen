It features delicate, hairy leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length, with a rosette growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads. Cotula pusilla is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid conditions. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
