    "intro": "Conopodium bunioides subsp. aranii, commonly known as the Armenian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features lanceolate leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, and its flowers are blue or violet, clustered in terminal racemes. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
