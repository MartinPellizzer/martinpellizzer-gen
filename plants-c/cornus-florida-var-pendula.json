    "intro": "Cornus florida var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping cherry or weeping dogwood, is a striking deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its cascading branches that create a graceful, weeping appearance, especially when adorned with clusters of white flowers in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate foliage, showy blooms, and unique form. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
