    "intro": "Clusia quadrata, commonly known as the waxleaf clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by orange-red berries. Clusia quadrata is well adapted to humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
