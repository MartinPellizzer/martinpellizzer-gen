    "intro": "Colpodium junceum, commonly known as slender basketgrass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Colpodium junceum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
