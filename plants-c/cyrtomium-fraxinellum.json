    "intro": "Cyrtomium fraxinellum, commonly known as the golden wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are often tinged with golden hues. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients. Cyrtomium fraxinellum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
