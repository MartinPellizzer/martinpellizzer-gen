It features tall, slender stems covered in dense, white or pale gray pubescence, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its overall rugged appearance.
