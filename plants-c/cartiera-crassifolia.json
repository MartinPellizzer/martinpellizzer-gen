    "intro": "Cartiera crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaved cartiera, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring. Its succulent nature makes it well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure. Cartiera crassifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its striking foliage and resilience."
