    "intro": "Cyclosorus elmerorum, commonly known as Elmer's cyclosorus, is a rare and delicate aquatic fern native to the western United States. It thrives in cool, shaded streams and springs, often growing in rocky substrates. The plant features slender, creeping rhizomes and small, orbicular leaves with a distinctive wavy margin. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality and ecological health."
