    "intro": "Ctenitis humida, commonly known as the swamp fern, is a species of aquatic fern found in wetland habitats. It has a creeping rhizome that produces dense clusters of dark green, leathery leaves. The leaves are divided into soft, feathery segments that help the plant float and absorb nutrients from the water. It thrives in stagnant or slow-moving freshwater environments. This plant plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms."
