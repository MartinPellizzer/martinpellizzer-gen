It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are rough to the touch, giving it its scientific name. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, forming clusters at the tips of the stems. Chrysopsis scabrifolia is adapted to drought conditions and has a deep root system to access water."
