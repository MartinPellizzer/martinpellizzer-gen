    "intro": "Carex ericetorum var. membranacea, commonly known as the membranaceous sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as bogs, fens, and wet meadows. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a thin, membranous sheath, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike of small, greenish flowers. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
