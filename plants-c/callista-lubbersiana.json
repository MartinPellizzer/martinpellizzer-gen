It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.
