    "intro": "Coffea pocsii, commonly known as the Pocsii coffee, is a rare and endemic species native to the highlands of Madagascar. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows in shaded, humid environments at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters. The plant produces small, red flowers followed by oval, cherry-like fruits containing one or two seeds. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and have a leathery texture, while its stems are woody and branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Coffea pocsii is considered a unique botanical specimen with potential for further study in plant biology and conservation."
