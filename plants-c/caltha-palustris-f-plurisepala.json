    "intro": "Caltha palustris f. plurisepala, commonly known as the many-sepaled marsh marigold, is a botanical variant of the marsh marigold native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. This form is distinguished by its elongated, showy sepals that are often longer than the petals, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with a subtle fragrance, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, stream banks, and marshes. The foliage consists of heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are also attractive in their own right."
