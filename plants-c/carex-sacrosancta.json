    "intro": "Carex sacrosancta, commonly known as sacred sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant has slender, triangular stems and produces spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Carex sacrosancta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forested areas."
