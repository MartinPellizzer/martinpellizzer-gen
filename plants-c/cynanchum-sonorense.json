It features a slender, branched stem that grows from a rhizomatous root system. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and covered with fine hairs. Cynanchum sonorense is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and small mammals."
