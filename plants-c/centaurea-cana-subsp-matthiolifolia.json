    "intro": "Centaurea cana subsp. matthiolifolia, commonly known as the alpine cornflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flower heads, which are composed of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lanceolate and often covered with fine hairs, and the stems are usually unbranched. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and hardy nature."
