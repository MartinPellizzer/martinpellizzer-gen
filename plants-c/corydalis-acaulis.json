    "intro": "Corydalis acaulis, commonly known as the naked-stem corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its slender, often leafless stems. The plant produces clusters of delicate, nodding flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple, which bloom in early spring. Its tubular flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, particularly bees. Corydalis acaulis is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
