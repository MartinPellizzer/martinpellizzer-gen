    "intro": "Colutea atabajevii, commonly known as the Tadjikistan broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of other species. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, and its seeds are enclosed in pods. It is native to Central Asia, particularly found in regions like Tajikistan and Afghanistan. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists studying plant interactions and ecological dependencies."
