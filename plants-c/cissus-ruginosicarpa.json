    "intro": "Cissus ruginosicarpa, commonly known as the rough-skinned grape. It is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa, characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves. The leaves are usually pubescent, with a rough texture due to the presence of stiff hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, berry-like fruits. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
