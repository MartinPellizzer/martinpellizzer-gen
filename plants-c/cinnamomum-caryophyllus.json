    "intro": "Cinnamomum caryophyllus, commonly known as cinnamon, is a small evergreen tree native to Sri Lanka and southern India. It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers that produce dark, spherical berries. The plant's bark, which contains the essential oil responsible for its distinctive scent, is the primary source of the spice cinnamon. The leaves are also used in traditional medicine for their antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. This plant thrives in tropical climates and requires well-drained soil and partial shade for optimal growth."
