    "intro": "Cynanchica aristata subsp. nestia, commonly known as the western milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to cream-colored flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Its seeds are adapted for dispersal by wind, contributing to its distribution across arid regions."
