It features opposite, simple, and usually ovate leaves that are smooth and glabrous, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or yellow, which bloom in the spring. Its berries are red or orange and serve as a food source for various birds and small mammals. Caprifolium glabratum is often found in woodland edges, stream banks, and other moist, well-drained soils."
