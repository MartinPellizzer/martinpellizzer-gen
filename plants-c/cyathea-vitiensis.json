    "intro": "Cyathea vitiensis, commonly known as the Vitiensis tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Vanuatu and Fiji. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. Its fronds can reach lengths of up to 3 meters, making it a striking feature in its natural habitat. Cyathea vitiensis plays an important ecological role in tropical rainforests, contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various organisms."
