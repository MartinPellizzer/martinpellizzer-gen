    "intro": "Cereus multangularis var. albispinus, commonly known as the White-spined Cactus, is a striking member of the Cactaceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in sharp, white spines. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for both ornamental and horticultural purposes."
