    "intro": "Chamaenerion fleischeri, commonly known as the Fleischer's fireweed, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in open, moist habitats such as tundra and wet meadows. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine, white pubescence. Chamaenerion fleischeri is adapted to cold climates and has a low-growing habit, often forming dense mats to protect itself from harsh environmental conditions."
