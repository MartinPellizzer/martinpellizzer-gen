    "intro": "Cnemidiscus, commonly known as the star-shaped liverwort, is a genus of small, non-vascular plants belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. These plants are typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where they can absorb moisture from the air. Cnemidiscus species are characterized by their leaf-like structures, which are often arranged in a star or fan shape, giving them their common name. They lack true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having structures called thallus that perform all necessary functions. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in ecological studies due to their sensitivity to environmental changes."
