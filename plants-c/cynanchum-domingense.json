    "intro": "Cynanchum domingense, commonly known as the Dominican milkweed, is a climbing vine native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its slender stems and opposite leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its milky sap, like that of many milkweeds, contains toxic compounds that deter herbivores. Cynanchum domingense is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks."
