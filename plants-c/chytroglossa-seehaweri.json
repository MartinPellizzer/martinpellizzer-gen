    "intro": "Chytroglossa seehaweri, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant features a short, rhizomatous stem with a few leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and green. Its flowers are clustered in a spike and bloom during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
