    "intro": "Cassinia longifolia, commonly known as the longifoliate cassinia, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, yellowish flowers surrounded by pale green bracts. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as woodlands and heaths, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight hairy texture, while the flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn. Cassinia longifolia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to attract native pollinators."
