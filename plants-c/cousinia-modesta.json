    "intro": "Cousinia modesta, commonly known as the slender globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and hairy, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to harsh, dry environments. Cousinia modesta is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
