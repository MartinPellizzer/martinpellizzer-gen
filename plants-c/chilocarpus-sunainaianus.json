    "intro": "Chilocarpus sunainaianus, commonly known as the Sunainaian sunflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant is distinguished by its vibrant yellow petals and dark green, heart-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
