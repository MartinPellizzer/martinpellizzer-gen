It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale yellow. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Due to its slow growth and attractive appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
