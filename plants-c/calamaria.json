    "intro": "Calamaria, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melanthiaceae. It is native to various regions of Europe and Asia, often found in woodland and grassland habitats. The plant features upright stems with lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white or green. Calamaria species are typically herbaceous perennials, with some varieties growing up to 1 meter in height. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
