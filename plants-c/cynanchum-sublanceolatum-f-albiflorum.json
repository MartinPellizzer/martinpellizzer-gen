    "intro": "Cynanchum sublanceolatum f. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered milkweed vine, is a variant of the genus Cynanchum, which belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae. This plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The most distinguishing feature of this form is its white, showy flowers that bloom in clusters, setting it apart from the typical green-flowered varieties. It is native to regions of East Asia, including China, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant contains milky sap, which is a common trait among members of the Asclepiadaceae family."
