It is characterized by its tall, slender culms and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, riverbanks, and wet meadows. Calamagrostis teberdensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
