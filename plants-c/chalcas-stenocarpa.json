    "intro": "Chalcas stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruit chalcas, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and knotweed. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of hairs. The fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that remains attached to the plant for an extended period, aiding in seed dispersal."
