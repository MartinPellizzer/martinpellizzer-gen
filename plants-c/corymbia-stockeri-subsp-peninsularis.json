    "intro": "Corymbia stockeri subsp. peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular Bloodwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the arid regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its rugged, gnarled trunk and thick, fissured bark that provides protection against fire and drought. The leaves are narrow, leathery, and often have a bluish-gray hue, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. The wood is hard and durable, historically used by indigenous communities for tools and construction."
