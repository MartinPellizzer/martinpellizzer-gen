    "intro": "Craterostigma longicarpum, commonly known as the long-seeded rock cress, is a small perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, alternate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its seeds are elongated and have a distinctive, thickened base, which aids in seed dispersal in its harsh environment. Craterostigma longicarpum is well adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate periods of drought."
