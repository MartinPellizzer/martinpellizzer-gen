    "intro": "Calotropis syriaca, commonly known as the Syrian milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring thick, fleshy stems and broad, palmate leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and white, which bloom in summer. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, containing cardiac glycosides. Calotropis syriaca is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it access water from deeper soil layers."
