    "intro": "Campanulorchis longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed bell orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its unique, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with its stems elongating over time to form a cascading appearance. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, often covered in a fine, velvety texture. This orchid is highly adapted to its humid, shaded environment and requires specific conditions to thrive."
