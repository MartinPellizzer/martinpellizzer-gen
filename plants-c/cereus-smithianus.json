    "intro": "Cereus smithianus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cactus native to South America. It is a columnar cactus with a tall, spiny stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. Its flowers are short-lived, lasting only a few hours, and are pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths. Cereus smithianus is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
