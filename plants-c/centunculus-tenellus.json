The plant features tiny, oval leaves that are densely packed and often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Centunculus tenellus is often found in meadows and along stream banks, where it contributes to the biodiversity of these habitats."
