    "intro": "Cremanthodium stenactinium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cremanthodium, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to harsh climatic conditions with its compact growth form. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The flowers, which are usually yellow or orange, bloom in early summer and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
