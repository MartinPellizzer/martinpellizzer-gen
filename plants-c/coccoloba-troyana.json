    "intro": "Coccoloba troyana, commonly known as the Troyan coccoloba, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often lobed and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often found in humid, tropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
