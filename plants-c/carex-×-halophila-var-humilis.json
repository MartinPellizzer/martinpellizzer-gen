    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 halophila var. humilis, commonly known as the salt marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal wetlands. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and spike-like flower clusters, typical of the Carex genus. This variety thrives in brackish or saline environments, making it well-adapted to tidal zones and estuaries. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in marshy areas. The plant plays an important ecological role in filtering water and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
