    "intro": "Campanula arenaria, commonly known as the sand bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry meadows. The plant produces small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Campanula arenaria is a hardy perennial that is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
