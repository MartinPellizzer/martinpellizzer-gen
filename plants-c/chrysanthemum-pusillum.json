    "intro": "Chrysanthemum pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf chrysanthemum, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb with compact, bushy growth habit, typically reaching heights of less than 30 centimeters. The plant features finely divided, aromatic leaves and produces small, yellow to orange flowers in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom late in the season, providing color when many other plants have finished flowering."
