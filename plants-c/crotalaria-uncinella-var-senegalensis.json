It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive spurred petals and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer, followed by pod-like fruits containing kidney-shaped seeds. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. However, it can be invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
