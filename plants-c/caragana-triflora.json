    "intro": "Caragana triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered shrub or Siberian pea shrub, is a deciduous shrub native to the cold climates of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually divided into 3 to 5 leaflets, and its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces leguminous pods that contain several seeds, which are often used for soil enrichment due to their nitrogen-fixing properties. Caragana triflora is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or rocky soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for reclamation projects. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological restoration and ornamental horticulture."
