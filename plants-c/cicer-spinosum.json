    "intro": "Cicer spinosum, commonly known as the spiny vetch, is a leguminous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, spiny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is typically found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Cicer spinosum is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment."
