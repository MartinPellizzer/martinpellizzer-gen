    "intro": "Chrysogonum heterophyllum, commonly known as the yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slight hairy texture, while its stems are upright and branching. Chrysogonum heterophyllum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
