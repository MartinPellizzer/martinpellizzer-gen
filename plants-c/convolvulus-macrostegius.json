    "intro": "Convolvulus macrostegius, commonly known as the large-fruited bindweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its twining stems and heart-shaped leaves, which are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in various habitats such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its ability to spread and colonize new areas."
