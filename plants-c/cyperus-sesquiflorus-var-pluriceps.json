The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically in spikelets at the base of the stems. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in ecological and botanical research."
