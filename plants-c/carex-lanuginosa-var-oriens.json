It is characterized by its dense, fluffy inflorescences that give it a distinctive, cotton-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wet meadows and forest floors. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and covered in fine, soft hairs. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats and is often used in ornamental gardening for its unique visual appeal."
