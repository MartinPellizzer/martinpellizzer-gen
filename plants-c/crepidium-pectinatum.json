    "intro": "Crepidium pectinatum, commonly known as the pectinate orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
