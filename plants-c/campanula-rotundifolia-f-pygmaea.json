It features small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has rounded, hairy leaves that are typically smaller than those of the species. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous environments. Due to its delicate appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
