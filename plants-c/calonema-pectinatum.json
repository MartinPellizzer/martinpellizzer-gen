    "intro": "Calonema pectinatum, commonly known as the velvetleaf plectranthus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Calonema pectinatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
