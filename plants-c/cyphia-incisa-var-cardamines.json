    "intro": "Cyphia incisa var. cardamines, commonly known as the narrowleaf cyphia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky slopes. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in humid environments. The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
