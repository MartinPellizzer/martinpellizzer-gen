    "intro": "Cinnamomum salvinii, commonly known as the Salvin's cinnamon, is a small evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves that emit a distinct cinnamon-like scent when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by dark purple berries, which are edible but not widely consumed. Its essential oils, extracted from the leaves and bark, are valued for their aromatic and medicinal properties. Cinnamomum salvinii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its role in traditional herbal remedies."
