    "intro": "Corytholoma chelonoides, commonly known as the horned lichen, is a member of the family Verrucariaceae. It is a foliose lichen that forms a distinctive, leathery thallus with a central, horn-like structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on bark or soil in temperate regions. Its morphology includes a dense, layered structure with a dark, almost black upper surface. The lichen is chemically complex, containing various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role and resistance to environmental stress."
