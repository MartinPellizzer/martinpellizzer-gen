    "intro": "Crataegus nuda, commonly known as the naked hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, often thornless bark and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red or orange berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. Crataegus nuda is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting various wildlife species."
