It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of blue and purple, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Due to its ornamental value and ease of care, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and indoor spaces."
