    "intro": "Cercidium texanum, commonly known as the Texas buckwheat, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its branching structure and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are adapted for dispersal by wind. It has small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Cercidium texanum is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
