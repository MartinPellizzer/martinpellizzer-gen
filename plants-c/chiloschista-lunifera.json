    "intro": "Chiloschista lunifera, commonly known as the moonlight moss, is a rare and delicate member of the Dendrochilaceae family. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky crevices. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves and produces intricate, fragrant flowers with a unique white and green coloration. Its growth is slow, and it requires specific environmental conditions to thrive. Due to its rarity and specific habitat needs, it is often found in isolated locations across the Andes."
