    "intro": "Combesia muscosa var. pseudolycopodioides, commonly known as the mossy clubmoss, is a rare and specialized plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and a creeping, rhizomatous growth habit. This variety is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are cone-like and contain spores. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
