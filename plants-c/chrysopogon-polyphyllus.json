    "intro": "Chrysopogon polyphyllus, commonly known as the many-leafed grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, pale green to golden yellow inflorescences, which are typically arranged in panicle-like clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and potential for erosion control, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
