    "intro": "Cerinthe glabra subsp. pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean horned poppy, is a perennial herb native to the Pyrenees region. It features slender, hairy stems that grow up to 60 cm tall, bearing alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces striking, papery flowers with two prominent, horn-like lobes, typically in shades of red or orange. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
