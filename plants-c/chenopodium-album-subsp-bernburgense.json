    "intro": "Chenopodium album subsp. bernburgense, commonly known as bitter spinach, is a wild annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and alternate, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine, prickly hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, and its seeds are enclosed in dry, three-lobed capsules. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. This subspecies is noted for its slightly bitter taste and has been used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some cultures."
