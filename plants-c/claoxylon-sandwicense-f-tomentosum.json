    "intro": "Claoxylon sandwicense f. tomentosum, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandwicense. It is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Hawaiian Islands, characterized by its distinctive, palm-like appearance with a single, unbranched trunk. The plant has a dense, fibrous covering on its stem, which gives it a woolly texture, hence the specific epithet \"tomentosum.\" Its leaves are pinnately compound, with long, narrow leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs. This species is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of Hawaii, including high humidity and nutrient-poor soils."
