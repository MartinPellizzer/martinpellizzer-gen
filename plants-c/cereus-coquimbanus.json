    "intro": "Cereus coquimbanus, commonly known as the Christmas Star, is a species of cactus native to the coastal regions of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to 10 feet in height. The plant produces large, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night, typically during the holiday season. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. The plant is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
