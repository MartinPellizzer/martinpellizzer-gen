    "intro": "Cyclosorus molliusculus, commonly known as the golden star moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with bright yellow to golden-green leaves that form a compact rosette. It reproduces through spores, which are released from small, cup-like structures called sporophytes. Cyclosorus molliusculus is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
