    "intro": "Codiaeum torrigianianum, commonly known as the flame maple or croton, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored, palmately lobed leaves that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is widely cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens."
