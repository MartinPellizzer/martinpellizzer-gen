It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and its profuse display of bright yellow flowers in late spring. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a hedge. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
