    "intro": "Ceratopteris siliquosa, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern that thrives in wetland environments. It has a distinctive frond structure with a serrated margin and a central vein that runs the length of the leaf. The plant produces sporangia in clusters along the fronds, which release spores into the water for reproduction. It is often used in scientific research due to its rapid growth and ease of cultivation. Ceratopteris siliquosa plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of freshwater ecosystems."
