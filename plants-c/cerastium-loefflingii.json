    "intro": "Cerastium loefflingii, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and typically forms a mat-like growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh alpine environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and alpine tundra. Cerastium loefflingii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
