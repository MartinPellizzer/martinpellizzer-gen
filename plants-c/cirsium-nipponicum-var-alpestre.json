    "intro": "Cirsium nipponicum var. alpestre, commonly known as the alpine thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, purple to pinkish-purple flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are generally lance-shaped with coarse, prickly margins, and the flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in high-altitude environments."
