    "intro": "Cheilanthes \u00d7 iberica, commonly known as the Iberian rock fern, is a hybrid species within the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant thrives in rocky, arid environments, often growing on limestone or sandstone substrates. Its spore-bearing structures, or sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Cheilanthes \u00d7 iberica is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in Mediterranean climates."
