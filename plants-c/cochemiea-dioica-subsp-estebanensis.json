    "intro": "Cochemiea dioica subsp. estebanensis, commonly known as Esteban's cholla, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, spiny stems that branch out to form a dense, shrub-like structure. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements. This subspecies is known for its resilience and ability to thrive in harsh desert conditions."
