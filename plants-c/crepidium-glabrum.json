    "intro": "Crepidium glabrum, commonly known as the smooth leek orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, elongated flower spike that bears several small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as swampy areas or along riverbanks. It produces a distinctive, tubular flower that is often pollinated by insects. Crepidium glabrum is a rare and endangered species, requiring specific environmental conditions for successful growth and reproduction."
