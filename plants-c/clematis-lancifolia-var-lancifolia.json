    "intro": "Clematis lancifolia var. lancifolia, commonly known as the lance-leaved clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It features slender, twining stems that can reach lengths of up to 15 feet, allowing it to climb trees or trellises. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of white, pink, or blue. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it has a fibrous, woody root system. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
