It is a member of the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and its clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine, sticky coating, giving it a unique texture. Caryopteris glutinosa is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
