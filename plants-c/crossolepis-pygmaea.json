    "intro": "Crossolepis pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf crossolepis, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
