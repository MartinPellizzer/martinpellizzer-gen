    "intro": "Cerastium thermale, commonly known as the thermal chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically forms dense mats of slender, hairy stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a common sight in temperate regions where it contributes to the undergrowth vegetation."
