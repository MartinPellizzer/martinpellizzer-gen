    "intro": "Crataegus parciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its simple, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Crataegus parciflora is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
