    "intro": "Cerastium brachypetalum var. strigosum, commonly known as the hairy mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as tundra, meadows, and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature and ability to withstand cold temperatures, it is an important component of alpine ecosystems."
