    "intro": "Colchicum variegatum var. desii, commonly known as the Desert Colchicum, is a perennial bulbous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features striking, waxy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a short, fibrous root system and produces a single, erect stem with a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves. Its bulbs are adapted to store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. The species is notable for its ornamental value and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
