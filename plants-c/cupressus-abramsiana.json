    "intro": "Cupressus abramsiana, commonly known as the Abrams' cypress, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves and conical shape, typical of the cypress family. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, inconspicuous cones that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
