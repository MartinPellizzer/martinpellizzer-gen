    "intro": "Crassula brevifolia subsp. psammophila, commonly known as the sand crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact, rounded rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
