    "intro": "Callipteris macrodictyon, commonly known as the broadleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and broad, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in panicles, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes used in landscaping."
