    "intro": "Cranichis brevirostris, commonly known as the short-beaked orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in pine and hardwood forests. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it survive in shaded environments. The species is relatively rare and is often found in association with other orchids in its habitat."
