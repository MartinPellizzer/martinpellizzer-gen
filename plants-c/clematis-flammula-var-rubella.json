    "intro": "Clematis flammula var. rubella, commonly known as the red-flowered Clematis, is a perennial vine native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, showy flowers that range from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, blue-black berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. Clematis flammula var. rubella is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
