    "intro": "Carex flava var. deficiens, commonly known as the yellow sedge, is a variant of the yellow sedge species native to North America. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its grass-like foliage and spike-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are usually bright yellow to golden green, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers in late spring to early summer. This plant plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
