    "intro": "Calochilus pulchellus, commonly known as the beautiful spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It features a slender, hairy stem with several lance-shaped leaves and produces striking, spider-like flowers in shades of pink and white. The flowers are typically borne on a single stem and are characterized by their elongated, narrow petals and sepals. This species is often found in open forests and grasslands, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is also threatened by habitat loss and land clearing."
