    "intro": "Convolvulus sepium var. soldanella, commonly known as the lesser bindweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit, with opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming from late spring to early autumn. It has a fibrous root system and is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in waste areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and rhizomes make it an aggressive weed in many regions."
