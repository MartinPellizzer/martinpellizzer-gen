    "intro": "Calogyne hians, commonly known as the hanging hyacinth, is a striking member of the Acanthaceae family. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its pendulous clusters of vibrant blue or purple flowers. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. Calogyne hians thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for hanging baskets or as a focal point in shaded garden areas."
