    "intro": "Carissa villosa, commonly known as the rough carissa, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, characterized by its thorny stems and dense foliage. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by yellow, egg-shaped berries. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. Carissa villosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
