    "intro": "Cynanchum arghel, commonly known as Argel milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite leaves that are usually lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by follicles containing toxic, milky sap. It is often found in rocky or dry habitats and is known for its medicinal uses in traditional medicine. However, due to its toxic compounds, it should be handled with care."
