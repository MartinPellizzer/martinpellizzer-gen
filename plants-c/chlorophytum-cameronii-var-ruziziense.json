    "intro": "Chlorophytum cameronii var. ruziziense, commonly known as the Ruziziensis spider plant, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to the eastern African region of Rwanda. It features linear, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green with a silver or white stripe running along the central vein. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers on slender stalks, which are followed by clusters of bright green, fleshy berries. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ease of propagation through offsets."
