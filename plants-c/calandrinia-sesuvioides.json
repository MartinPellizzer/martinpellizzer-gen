    "intro": "Calandrinia sesuvioides, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual or biennial herb with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its adaptability to saline and sandy soils makes it a common species in disturbed habitats. Calandrinia sesuvioides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in drought conditions."
