    "intro": "Ceratozamia purpurea, commonly known as the purple cycad, is a slow-growing evergreen plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the cycad family, which is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant has a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus, which consists of a female cone and male cones. Its leaves are typically a deep green with a waxy texture, and the plant produces a distinctive, fragrant odor when mature. Ceratozamia purpurea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is considered a living fossil due to its ancient lineage."
