    "intro": "Connarus detersus, commonly known as the slender connarus, is a tropical shrub native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by dark blue to black berries. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in its native range."
