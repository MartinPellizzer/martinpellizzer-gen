    "intro": "Colanthelia distans, commonly known as the distant colanthelia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
