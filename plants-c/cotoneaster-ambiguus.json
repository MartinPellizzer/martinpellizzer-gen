    "intro": "Cotoneaster ambiguus, commonly known as the variable cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features opposite, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. These are followed by bright red berries that persist into winter, providing food for birds and other wildlife. Cotoneaster ambiguus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions."
