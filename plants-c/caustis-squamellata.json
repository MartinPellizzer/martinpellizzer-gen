    "intro": "Caustis squamellata, commonly known as the silverleaf caustis, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are covered in fine, silvery hairs, which give it its common name and help reduce water loss. Caustis squamellata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
