    "intro": "Cordia lenis, commonly known as the white cordia, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Cordia lenis is often found in dry, open habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
