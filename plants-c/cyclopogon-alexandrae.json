    "intro": "Cyclopogon alexandrae, commonly known as the Alexandra's cyclopogon, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant grows in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for both horticulturists and botanists."
