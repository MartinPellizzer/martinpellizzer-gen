It possesses small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are red and contain toxic compounds, which deter herbivores. Critonia thyrsoidea is native to parts of South America and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
