    "intro": "Caladium marginatum, commonly known as the white-veined caladium, is a tropical perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with white or cream-colored veins. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is the primary ornamental feature, making it popular in gardens and as a houseplant. Caladium marginatum is often used in shaded or partially shaded areas to add vibrant color to landscapes."
