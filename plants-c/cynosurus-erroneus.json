    "intro": "Cynosurus erroneus, commonly known as the false bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, and its narrow, grass-like leaves are usually blue-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the end of each stem, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Cynosurus erroneus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
