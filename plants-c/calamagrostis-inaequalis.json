    "intro": "Calamagrostis inaequalis, commonly known as the unequal reed, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are usually pale green to brownish in color. Calamagrostis inaequalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
