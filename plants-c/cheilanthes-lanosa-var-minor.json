    "intro": "Cheilanthes lanosa var. minor, commonly known as the woolly rock fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its finely hairy, leathery leaves that are often covered in a soft, woolly texture, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments, thriving in limestone substrates. Its fronds are usually compact and clustered, with a distinctive, narrow shape. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
