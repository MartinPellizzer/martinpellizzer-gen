    "intro": "Cerastium succulentum, commonly known as the woolly mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments. Its compact form and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and wildflower displays."
