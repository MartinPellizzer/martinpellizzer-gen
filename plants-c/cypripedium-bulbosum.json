    "intro": "Cypripedium bulbosum, commonly known as the bulbous lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy pink or purple flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch. The plant has a thick, fleshy rhizome that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in its harsh, high-altitude habitat. Its leaves are broad and often hairy, adapting to the cool, moist conditions of its environment. Cypripedium bulbosum is a protected species due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat destruction."
