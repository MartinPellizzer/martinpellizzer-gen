    "intro": "Campanula pusilla f. densa, commonly known as the dense bellflower, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming in early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, while its stems are short and often prostrate. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils."
