It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its dense, woody stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are often fragrant, followed by oval, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or as a source of medicinal compounds."
