    "intro": "Cattleya longipes, commonly known as the longiped cattleya, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter, with vibrant pink and white petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water to help it survive dry periods. Cattleya longipes is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
