    "intro": "Caprifolium arboreum, commonly known as the European honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but not typically for humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Caprifolium arboreum is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to attract pollinators."
