    "intro": "Chileorebutia fulva, commonly known as the Orange Moon cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a distinctive orange to red coloration on its stems. The plant features areoles, which are specialized structures from which spines, flowers, and branches emerge. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, blooming in the evening and lasting only a single day. Chileorebutia fulva is well adapted to dry environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and thriving in full sun with minimal watering."
