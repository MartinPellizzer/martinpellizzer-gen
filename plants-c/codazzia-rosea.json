    "intro": "Codazzia rosea, commonly known as the pink velvet fern, is a unique member of the Lycopodiaceae family, characterized by its soft, velvety fronds that range in color from pale pink to deep rose. It is a non-vascular plant, meaning it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead has specialized structures called rhizomes and microphylls. Native to the humid tropical regions of South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant's striking appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental use in botanical gardens and as a houseplant. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are clustered at the base of the plant and produce spores for propagation."
