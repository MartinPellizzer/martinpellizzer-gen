    "intro": "Cuscuta lehmanniana var. esquamata, commonly known as the silverleaf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, white or yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for many years. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
