    "intro": "Ctenitis warburii, commonly known as the Warburton's bladder fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, pinnately divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in specialized structures called indusia, which are attached to the undersides of the fronds. Ctenitis warburii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
