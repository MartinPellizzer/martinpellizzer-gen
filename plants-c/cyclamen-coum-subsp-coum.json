    "intro": "Cyclamen coum subsp. coum, commonly known as the Persian cyclamen, is a species native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, spurred flowers that bloom in shades of pink, white, and purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens or shaded rockeries. Its tuberous roots allow it to survive periods of dormancy, and it is known for its ornamental value in horticulture. The flowers typically appear in late winter to early spring, adding early color to gardens during the colder months."
