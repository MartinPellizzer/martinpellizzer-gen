    "intro": "Cyrtidiorchis rhomboglossa, commonly known as the rhombus-lip orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit, featuring a pseudobulb that supports its foliage and flowering structure. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive rhomboid-shaped lip, which is a key identifying feature. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with intricate patterns, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
