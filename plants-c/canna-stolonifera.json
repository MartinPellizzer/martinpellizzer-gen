    "intro": "Canna stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping canna, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces striking orange or red flowers with a prominent yellow center, which bloom in summer. Canna stolonifera spreads via rhizomes and stolons, making it a vigorous grower in moist, sunny environments. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and water features."
