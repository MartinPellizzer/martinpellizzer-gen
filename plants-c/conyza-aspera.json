    "intro": "Conyza aspera, commonly known as rough hound's tongue, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its widespread distribution. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Conyza aspera is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies."
