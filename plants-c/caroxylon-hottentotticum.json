    "intro": "Caroxylon hottentotticum, commonly known as the Hottentot's thorn, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, woody fruits. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping in dry climates."
