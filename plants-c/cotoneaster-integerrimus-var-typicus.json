    "intro": "Cotoneaster integerrimus var. typicus, commonly known as the Pacific Coast cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to coastal regions of western North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, upright growth with small, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its foliage provides habitat for birds and other wildlife, and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. The species is adapted to coastal climates, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
