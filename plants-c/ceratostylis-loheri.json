    "intro": "Ceratostylis loheri, commonly known as the Loher's spike orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropics of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understorey areas. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil. The orchid's unique floral structure and specific habitat requirements make it a rare and ecologically significant species."
