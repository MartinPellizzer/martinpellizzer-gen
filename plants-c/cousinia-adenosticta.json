    "intro": "Cousinia adenosticta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cousinia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, pale purple to white flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters known as spikelets. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Cousinia adenosticta is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions, including high altitudes and low precipitation."
