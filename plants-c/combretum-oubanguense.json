It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its striking, fiery red flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release small, winged seeds.
