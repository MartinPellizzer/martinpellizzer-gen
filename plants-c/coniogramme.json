    "intro": "Coniogramme, commonly known as the golden thread fern, is a tropical fern species belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, golden hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in high humidity. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil surfaces. Coniogramme is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
