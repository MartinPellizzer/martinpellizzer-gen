    "intro": "Carex albula, commonly known as the white sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale brown flowers in spikelets. Native to wetland and marshy areas, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and is often found in temperate regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
