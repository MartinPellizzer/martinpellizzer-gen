    "intro": "Cleistocalyx pennelii, commonly known as the New Zealand white pandanus, is a tropical plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically hidden within leaf sheaths, a feature that gives it its scientific name \"cleistocalyx,\" meaning \"closed calyx.\" It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found growing near the shoreline. The leaves are used in traditional M\u0101ori culture for weaving and other crafts."
