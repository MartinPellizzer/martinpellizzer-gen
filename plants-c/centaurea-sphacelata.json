    "intro": "Centaurea sphacelata, commonly known as the narrowleaf cornflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom from summer to autumn. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas. Centaurea sphacelata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
