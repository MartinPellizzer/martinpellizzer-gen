    "intro": "Chondropetalum microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in tiny, scale-like leaves called microphylls. Its reproductive structures consist of strobila, which are cone-like clusters that produce spores. Chondropetalum microcarpum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
