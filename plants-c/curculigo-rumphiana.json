    "intro": "Curculigo rumphiana, commonly known as the African arrowroot or swamp arrowroot, is a tropical perennial herb native to Africa and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary part used for culinary and medicinal purposes. The plant typically grows in wet, swampy areas and has heart-shaped leaves with a smooth surface. Its flowers are small and clustered in cymes, often with white or pale pink petals. The tubers are starchy and have a mild flavor, making them a valuable food source in regions where they are cultivated."
