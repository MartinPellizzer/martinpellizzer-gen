    "intro": "Chenopodium salinum, commonly known as saltbush, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and arid regions with high soil salinity. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically greenish-white and clustered in dense inflorescences. Chenopodium salinum plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
