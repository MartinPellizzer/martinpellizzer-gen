    "intro": "Cestrum strictum, commonly known as the night blooming jasmine, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. Cestrum strictum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and pleasant evening fragrance."
