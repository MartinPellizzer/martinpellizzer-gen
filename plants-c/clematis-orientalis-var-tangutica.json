    "intro": "Clematis orientalis var. tangutica, commonly known as the Tangutian Clematis, is a deciduous vine native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, twining stems that can reach lengths of up to 10 meters, supported by prickly, woody tendrils. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, with three to five oval-shaped leaflets, and it prefers well-drained, loamy soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
