    "intro": "Cyperus rivularis f. elutus, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in dense, tufted clusters at the base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist to aquatic habitats, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems."
