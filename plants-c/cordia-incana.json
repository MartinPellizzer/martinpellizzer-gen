    "intro": "Cordia incana, commonly known as the silverleaf cordia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in terminal panicles. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds. Cordia incana is often found in dry, disturbed habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
