It is characterized by its spiny, columnar stems and is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, often in shades of white, pink, or yellow. Its growth habit is generally low-growing and sprawling, with a tendency to form dense mats. The species is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
