    "intro": "Cyperus amoenus, commonly known as the purple flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to water-saturated soils. Its slender, grass-like leaves are usually dark green, and it produces small, clustered purple or brown flowers that bloom from summer to fall. Cyperus amoenus is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate wet conditions."
