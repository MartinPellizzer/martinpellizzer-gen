It is characterized by its small, glaucous leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically borne in dense, cup-like structures called cyathia. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This variety is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
