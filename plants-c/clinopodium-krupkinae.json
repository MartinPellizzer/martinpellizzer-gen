    "intro": "Clinopodium krupkinae, commonly known as Krupe's mint, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a distinctive minty fragrance, while its small white or purple flowers bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Clinopodium krupkinae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
