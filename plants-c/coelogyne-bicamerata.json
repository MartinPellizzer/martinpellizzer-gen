    "intro": "Coelogyne bicamerata, commonly known as the two-chambered orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange. The plant's pseudobulbs are elongated and segmented, with strap-like leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. Its flowers are highly prized in horticulture for their beauty and longevity, often blooming during the winter months. Coelogyne bicamerata requires specific care, including high humidity and bright, indirect light, to thrive in cultivation."
