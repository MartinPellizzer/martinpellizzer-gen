It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, greenish flowers. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that are covered in hooked bracts, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its adaptability, it can become a weed in cultivated areas."
