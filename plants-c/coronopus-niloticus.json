    "intro": "Coronopus niloticus, commonly known as the Nile coronopus, is a flowering plant native to Egypt and parts of the Middle East. It is a member of the Leguminosae family and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils near water sources, such as the banks of the Nile. It is often found in arid and semi-arid regions, adapting well to dry conditions. The seeds of Coronopus niloticus are encased in a hairy pod and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across suitable habitats."
