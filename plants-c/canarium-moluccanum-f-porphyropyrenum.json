    "intro": "Canarium moluccanum f. porphyropyrenum, commonly known as the Porphyropyrene Canarium, is a rare botanical variant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its unique leaf morphology and fruit structure. The plant typically grows in tropical rainforests, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its fruits are notable for their thick, waxy coating, which aids in seed dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
