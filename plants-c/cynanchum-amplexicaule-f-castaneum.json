This plant is native to parts of East Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often have a distinctive reddish vein pattern, which sets it apart from other milkweed species. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
