    "intro": "Cyphomandra endopogon subsp. guianensis, commonly known as the Guianan bitterapple, is a species native to South America, particularly found in Guyana and adjacent regions. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in tropical rainforests. The plant produces small, green, berry-like fruits that are generally considered toxic due to their high concentration of alkaloids. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a rough texture, while the flowers are small and white or pale green. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique chemical composition and potential medicinal properties."
