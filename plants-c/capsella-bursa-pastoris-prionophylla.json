It produces white flowers with five petals, which are typically clustered in umbels. The plant has a fibrous root system and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in gardens. Its leaves are hairy and have a slightly bitter taste, while its seeds are small and dispersed by wind. This species is widespread across temperate regions and is considered a weed in many agricultural settings."
