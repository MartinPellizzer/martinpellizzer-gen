    "intro": "Chrysopogon fulvus, commonly known as the golden grass or red grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that often display a reddish or golden hue, especially under certain light conditions. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically pale green or yellowish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Chrysopogon fulvus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems as a food source for various herbivores."
