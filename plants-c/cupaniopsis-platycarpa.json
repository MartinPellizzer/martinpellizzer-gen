    "intro": "Cupaniopsis platycarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruited cupaniopsis, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits that turn red when mature. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and horticultural cultivation in suitable climates."
