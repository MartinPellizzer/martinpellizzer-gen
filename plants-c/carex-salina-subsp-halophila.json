    "intro": "Carex salina subsp. halophila, commonly known as salt meadow sedge, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas and salt marshes where it tolerates high concentrations of salt in the soil and water. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
