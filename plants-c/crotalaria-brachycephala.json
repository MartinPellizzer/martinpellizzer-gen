It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its pod-bearing fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with erect stems and palmately lobed leaves. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in racemes and are followed by distinctive, inflated pods. Crotalaria brachycephala is often found in disturbed habitats and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
