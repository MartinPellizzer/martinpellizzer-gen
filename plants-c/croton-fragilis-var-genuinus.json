    "intro": "Croton fragilis var. genuinus, commonly known as the brittle croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often brightly colored with shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
