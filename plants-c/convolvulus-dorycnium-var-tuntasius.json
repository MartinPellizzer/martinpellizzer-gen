    "intro": "Convolvulus dorycnium var. tuntasius, commonly known as the Tuntasius bindweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
