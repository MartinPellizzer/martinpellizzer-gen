    "intro": "Cousinia meshhedensis, commonly known as the Meshedan cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant yellow flowers. The plant typically features basal leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape, and it produces small, daisy-like composite flowers. Cousinia meshhedensis is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it access water from deeper soil layers. It is often found in rocky soils and is considered a valuable component of local flora in its native habitat."
