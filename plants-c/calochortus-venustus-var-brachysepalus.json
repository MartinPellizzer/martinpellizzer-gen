    "intro": "Calochortus venustus var. brachysepalus, commonly known as the short-sepal glory-of-the-snow, is a striking member of the Liliaceae family native to California. It is characterized by its vibrant, cup-shaped flowers that range from white to pink and yellow, often with a red or orange throat. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and open habitats, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its bulbs are adapted for storage, allowing it to survive dry periods. This variety is distinguished by its shorter sepals compared to the typical form of Calochortus venustus."
