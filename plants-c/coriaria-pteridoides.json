    "intro": "Coriaria pteridoides, commonly known as the creeping coralroot, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has leathery, elliptical leaves that are dark green and often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Coriaria pteridoides is notable for its ability to form extensive mats, which help stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
