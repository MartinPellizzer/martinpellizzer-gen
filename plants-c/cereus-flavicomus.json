    "intro": "Cereus flavicomus, commonly known as the yellow-stemmed night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, a typical adaptation for water conservation in its native habitat. The flowers are often followed by small, red fruits that contain seeds, completing its reproductive cycle."
