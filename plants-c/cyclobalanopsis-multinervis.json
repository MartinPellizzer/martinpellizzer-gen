    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis multinervis, commonly known as the broad-leaved ironwood, is a large evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its hard, durable wood. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves with prominent veins, and it produces small, spiky nuts enclosed in a woody cupule. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is considered a valuable but threatened species in its native range."
