    "intro": "Campanula macrocephala, commonly known as the large-headed bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, often with a white throat. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, with lance-shaped leaves that are hairy beneath. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Campanula macrocephala is also known for its long blooming period, which extends from late spring through early autumn."
