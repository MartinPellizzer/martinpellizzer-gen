    "intro": "Clematis dissecta, commonly known as the Japanese clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to East Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple during the summer months. It thrives in partial to full sun and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Clematis dissecta is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often used in gardens to climb trellises or walls."
