    "intro": "Cyananthus microrhombeus var. leiocalyx, commonly known as the small-leafed bluebell, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a flowering plant belonging to the Boraginaceae family, characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and delicate, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, and produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The varietal form, leiocalyx, is distinguished by its slightly larger and more elongated leaves compared to the typical variety."
