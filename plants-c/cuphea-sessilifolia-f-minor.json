    "intro": "Cuphea sessilifolia f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf cuphea, is a compact, ornamental plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It features striking, tubular red or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its compact growth habit and vibrant floral display make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
