    "intro": "Cyrtomium falcatum subsp. falcatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf holly fern, is a perennial fern native to the southeastern United States. It features feather-like, pinnate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
