    "intro": "Crinum erubescens var. corantinum, commonly known as the red-flowered crinum, is a tropical herbaceous plant native to Central and South America. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red, often with a distinctive yellow or orange throat. The plant has strap-like, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. It produces a tall, leafless stem that bears the floral display, and its bulbs are used for propagation. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm, humid climates."
