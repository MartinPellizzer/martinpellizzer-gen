    "intro": "Cynanchum ovatum, commonly known as the Chinese milkweed or the nightshade-like plant, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds. Cynanchum ovatum is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological and medicinal studies."
