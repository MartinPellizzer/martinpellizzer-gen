    "intro": "Coryphopteris gymnopoda var. gymnopoda, commonly known as the naked-stemmed huperzia, is a fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, unbranched stems and small, ovate leaves with a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the undersides of the leaves. This variety is notable for its lack of true roots and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
