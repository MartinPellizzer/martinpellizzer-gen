It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in small, scale-like leaves. Its inflorescence is a dense, spike-like cluster of small, three-parted flowers. The botanical features of Cyperus racemosus make it well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
