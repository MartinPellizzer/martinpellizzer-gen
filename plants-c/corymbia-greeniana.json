    "intro": "Corymbia greeniana, commonly known as the green ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin strips, and its lance-shaped leaves that are typically glaucous blue-green in color. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which bloom during the wet season. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Corymbia greeniana is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
