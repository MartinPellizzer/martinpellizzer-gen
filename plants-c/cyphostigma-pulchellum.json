    "intro": "Cyphostigma pulchellum, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and velvety, waxy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of violet, pink, and white. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cyphostigma pulchellum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ease of care."
