    "intro": "Cyathocline lawii, commonly known as the Hawaiian cyathocline, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Hawaii. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, cup-shaped inflorescence known as a cyathium. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered together to form a single, showy structure. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cyathocline lawii is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
