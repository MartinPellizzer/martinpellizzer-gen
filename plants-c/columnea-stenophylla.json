    "intro": "Columnea stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed flame flower, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat, and produces lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Columnea stenophylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is popular among tropical plant enthusiasts."
