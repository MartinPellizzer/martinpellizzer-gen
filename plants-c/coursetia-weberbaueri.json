    "intro": "Coursetia weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer coursetia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and often nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features small, compound leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its adaptations to dry environments include deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area. Coursetia weberbaueri is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
