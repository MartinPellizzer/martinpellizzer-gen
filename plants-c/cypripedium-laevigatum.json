    "intro": "Cypripedium laevigatum, commonly known as the small white lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its pale white petals and a distinctive, pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it receives indirect sunlight. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant is known for its delicate, fragrant appearance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
