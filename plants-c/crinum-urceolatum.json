It features strap-shaped, often bluish-green leaves that are broad and stiff, growing from a bulbous base. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, or orange, which bloom in clusters at the top of the stems. It is adapted to wet or marshy habitats and is often found near water bodies. Crinum urceolatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
