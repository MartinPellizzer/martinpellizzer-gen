    "intro": "Chamaecrista falcata, commonly known as the narrowleaf burr legume, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, trifoliate leaves with a distinctive falcate (sickle-shaped) leaflet. The plant produces clusters of yellow to orange pea-like flowers, followed by elongated, spiny pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Chamaecrista falcata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
