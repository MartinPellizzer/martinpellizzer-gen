    "intro": "Coelogyne occultata var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flowered hidden orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, narrow pseudobulbs and striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in a single, showy inflorescence. The plant produces waxy, white or pale yellow petals with a prominent, often contrasting lip. It thrives in high-altitude, humid environments with partial shade and well-drained soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and conservationists alike."
