These plants are typically herbaceous, with simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy or glandular. Capraria species produce small, clustered flowers with five petals, usually in shades of white, yellow, or red. The fruits are capsules that release tiny seeds when mature. They are often found in moist, shady habitats and are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
