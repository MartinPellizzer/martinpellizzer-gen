    "intro": "Corynotheca micrantha var. acanthoclada, commonly known as the spiked corynotheca, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny bracts that enclose the flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub with hairy stems and small, pale yellow or greenish-white flowers. Its botanical features make it a notable species in its native habitat, though it is not widely cultivated. The varietal form, acanthoclada, is distinguished by its more pronounced spines compared to the typical variety."
