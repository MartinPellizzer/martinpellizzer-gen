    "intro": "Cleome augustinensis, commonly known as the \"spider flower,\" is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive, branching stems and showy, pink to purple flowers that resemble spider legs, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture, while the flowers bloom in clusters at the ends of the stems. Cleome augustinensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens due to its vibrant blooms and relatively low maintenance requirements."
