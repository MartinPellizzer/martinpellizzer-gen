    "intro": "Claytonia maritima, commonly known as sea kale, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and in moist, rocky habitats. The plant features rosettes of waxy, spoon-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Small, white flowers with five petals appear in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees. It is valued for its edible leaves, which have a mild, cabbage-like flavor and are historically used in coastal cuisines."
