    "intro": "Ctenitis chungyiensis, commonly known as the Chungyi's rock fern, is a rare and ancient species belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a unique, segmented structure and a creeping rhizome system. Native to the mountainous regions of southern China, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Its spore-producing structures are typically located on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
