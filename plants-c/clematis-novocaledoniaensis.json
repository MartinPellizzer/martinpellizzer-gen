    "intro": "Clematis novocaledoniaensis, commonly known as the New Caledonia clematis, is a flowering plant native to the island of New Caledonia in the South Pacific. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and showy, usually fragrant flowers. The plant features compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth, where it relies on its twining stems for support. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
