    "intro": "Coffea arabica var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate arabica, is a lesser-known variant of the coffee plant native to Ethiopia. It is characterized by its medium-sized red berries and intermediate traits between the typical Arabica and Robusta species. This variety is often grown in higher altitudes where cooler temperatures support its growth. Its leaves are elliptical with a glossy surface, and it produces a unique flavor profile with hints of citrus and floral notes. Due to its rarity and specific growing conditions, it is less commercially cultivated compared to other coffee varieties."
