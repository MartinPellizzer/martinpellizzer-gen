    "intro": "Croton lichenisilvae, commonly known as the forest croton, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, glossy surface and striking, multicolored bracts that range from red to yellow. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to shaded environments."
