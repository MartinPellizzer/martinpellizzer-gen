    "intro": "Cephalocereus lehmannianus, commonly known as the Lehmann's candle bush, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its structure is adapted to store water and survive in arid environments. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
