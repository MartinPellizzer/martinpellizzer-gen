    "intro": "Cypselocarpus, commonly known as the \"spearpod\" or \"cypress-fruit,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots. These plants are characterized by their unique fruit structures, which are dry, one-seeded, and often shaped like a spear or needle. Cypselocarpus species typically grow in temperate regions and are often found in woodland or shrubland habitats. Their leaves are usually compound, with finely divided blades, and they produce small, yellowish flowers in umbel-like clusters. The genus is relatively small, with only a few recognized species, and is of interest to botanists due to its distinctive morphology and ecological adaptations."
