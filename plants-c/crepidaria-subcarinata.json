    "intro": "Crepidaria subcarinata, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed crepidia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and finely divided, feather-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Crepidaria subcarinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
