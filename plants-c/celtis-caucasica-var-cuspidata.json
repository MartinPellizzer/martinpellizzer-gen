    "intro": "Celtis caucasica var. cuspidata, commonly known as the Caucasus hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the Elm family (Ulmaceae) and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves with pointed tips. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits that are edible for some wildlife. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks. The bark is smooth when young but becomes fissured with age, providing a distinctive appearance."
