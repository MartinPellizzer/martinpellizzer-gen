    "intro": "Coelogyne propinqua, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients during dry periods. Its roots are fibrous and often grow in the shaded undergrowth of its natural habitat. Coelogyne propinqua is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
