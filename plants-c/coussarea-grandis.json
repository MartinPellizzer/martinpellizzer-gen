    "intro": "Coussarea grandis, commonly known as the giant coussarea, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a climbing shrub that can grow up to 20 meters in height, featuring thick, woody stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom throughout the year in warm climates. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitats. It is often found in rainforests, where it contributes to the structural complexity of the understory."
