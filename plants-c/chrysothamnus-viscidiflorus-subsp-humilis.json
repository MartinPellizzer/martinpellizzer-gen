    "intro": "Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus subsp. humilis, commonly known as sticky goldenbush, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and sticky, glandular leaves that give it its common name. The plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Its structure consists of multiple stems that branch near the base, with small, ovate leaves arranged oppositely. The species is adapted to arid conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
