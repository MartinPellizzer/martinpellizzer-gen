It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Campylospermum chapelieri is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive blooms."
