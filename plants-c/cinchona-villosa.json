    "intro": "Cinchona villosa, commonly known as the hairy quinine tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in countries like Peru and Bolivia. The plant is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by orange-red berries containing elliptical seeds. Cinchona villosa is notable for its historical use in the production of quinine, a compound once used to treat malaria."
