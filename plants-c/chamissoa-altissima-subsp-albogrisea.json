    "intro": "Chamissoa altissima subsp. albogrisea, commonly known as the silverleaf chamissoa, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, overlapping layers of fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are small, tubular, and usually pink to red in color, appearing in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid landscapes."
