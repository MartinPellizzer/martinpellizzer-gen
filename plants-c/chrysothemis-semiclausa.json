    "intro": "Chrysothemis semiclausa, commonly known as the narrowleaf goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Chrysothemis semiclausa is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
