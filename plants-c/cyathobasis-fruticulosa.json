    "intro": "Cyathobasis fruticulosa, commonly known as the spiky leaf shrub, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater in dry soils. Cyathobasis fruticulosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
