    "intro": "Caesalpinia mimosoides var. wallichiana, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are often mistaken for those of the mimosa plant, with bipinnate foliage that gives it a feathery appearance. The plant produces bright yellow, pendulous flowers that bloom in clusters, creating a striking visual display. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. This species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping and as a shade provider in tropical gardens."
