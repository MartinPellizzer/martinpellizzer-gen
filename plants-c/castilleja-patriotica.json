    "intro": "Castilleja patriotica, commonly known as the American paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange tubular flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its root system to absorb nutrients from host plants. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Castilleja patriotica plays an important ecological role by providing nectar to pollinators like bees and butterflies."
