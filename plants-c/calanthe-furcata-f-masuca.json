    "intro": "Calanthe furcata f. masuca, commonly known as the Japanese calanthe, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its elegant, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks in forested areas. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to anchor itself in moist, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable and often protected species in its native range."
