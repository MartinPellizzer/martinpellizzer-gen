    "intro": "Coelogyne kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high elevations of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It is characterized by its tall, branched inflorescence that bears numerous fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant has strap-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it thrives in cool, humid conditions. It is a terrestrial orchid, often growing in mossy areas on mountain slopes. Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered a vulnerable species."
