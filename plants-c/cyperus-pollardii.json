    "intro": "Cyperus pollardii, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Its slender, grass-like stems are usually less than 1 meter tall, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes. Cyperus pollardii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
