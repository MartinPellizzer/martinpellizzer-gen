    "intro": "Coeloglossum viride f. subalpinum, commonly known as the alpine green hawksbeard, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to high-altitude environments. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers. This subspecies thrives in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it tolerates cold temperatures and strong winds. Its growth is slow, and it often forms dense mats to anchor itself in unstable terrain. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
