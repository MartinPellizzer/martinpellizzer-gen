It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in racemes and bloom in early summer. Chenolea tomentosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
