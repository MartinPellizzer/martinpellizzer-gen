    "intro": "Carex okesii, commonly known as the Oakes sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the wetlands of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in marshy or swampy areas. Its rhizomes help it spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. Carex okesii is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in water garden settings."
