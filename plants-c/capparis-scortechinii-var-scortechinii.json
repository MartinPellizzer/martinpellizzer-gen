It is characterized by its woody stems and pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. The berries are edible when ripe but have a sour taste, and the plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
