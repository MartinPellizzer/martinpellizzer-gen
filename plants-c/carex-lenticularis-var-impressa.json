    "intro": "Carex lenticularis var. impressa, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to North America. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly compressed, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green hue. The inflorescence consists of a single, elongated spike that bears small, three-lobed flowers, which are often wind-pollinated."
