    "intro": "Cheilanthes covillei subsp. intertexta, commonly known as the intertextured rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its spore-bearing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. This subspecies is often found in crevices and on limestone formations, showcasing its ability to colonize harsh, nutrient-poor soils."
