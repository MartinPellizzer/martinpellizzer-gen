It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange or yellow fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated in warm climates for its aesthetic value."
