    "intro": "Cordyline nobilis, commonly known as the cabbage tree, is a striking tropical plant native to Polynesia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to three meters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are often used in traditional Hawaiian cuisine and crafts. Cordyline nobilis is well adapted to coastal environments and thrives in well-drained soil with plenty of sunlight."
