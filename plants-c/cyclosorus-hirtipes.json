    "intro": "Cyclosorus hirtipes, commonly known as the hairy cyclosorus, is a species of aquatic fern found in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes are well-developed, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves and are a key feature for identification."
