    "intro": "Cotyledon umbilicus-veneris subsp. pendulina, commonly known as the hanging cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially when exposed to sunlight. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in dry conditions make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
