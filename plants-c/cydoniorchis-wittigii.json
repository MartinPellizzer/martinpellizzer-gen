    "intro": "Cydoniorchis wittigii, commonly known as the Wittig's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes intricate sepals and petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its small, delicate flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish in color, adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Cydoniorchis wittigii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
