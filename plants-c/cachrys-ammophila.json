    "intro": "Cachrys ammophila, commonly known as the beach dandelion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It thrives in sandy, salty environments and is often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant has small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cachrys ammophila plays a vital role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion through its extensive root system."
