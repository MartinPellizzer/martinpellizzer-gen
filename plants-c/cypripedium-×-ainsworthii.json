    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 ainsworthii, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium pubescens. It is a herbaceous perennial with a distinctive, pouch-like flower that resembles a slipper, typically ranging in color from white to pink. The plant features a single, erect stem with broad, dark green leaves and a single, showy bloom that appears in late spring to early summer. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and protected areas."
