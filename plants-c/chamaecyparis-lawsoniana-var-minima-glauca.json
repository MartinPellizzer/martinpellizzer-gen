    "intro": "Chamaecyparis lawsoniana var. minima-glauca, commonly known as the Lawson's cypress miniature glaucous, is a compact, slow-growing coniferous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features dense, scale-like foliage that is typically a bluish-green color, giving it a striking, frost-tinted appearance. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that are often retained on the branches for an extended period. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in rock gardens or as a foundation plant in landscaped settings."
