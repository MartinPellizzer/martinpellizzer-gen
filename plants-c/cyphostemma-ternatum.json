    "intro": "Cyphostemma ternatum, commonly known as the desert milkvine, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is a climbing shrub that belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, characterized by its milky sap and distinctive floral structures. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often followed by follicle fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a lobed or trifoliate appearance, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Cyphostemma ternatum is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities."
