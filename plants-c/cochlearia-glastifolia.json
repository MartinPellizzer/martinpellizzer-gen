    "intro": "Cochlearia glastifolia, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant is characterized by its small, white flowers and hairy, lobed leaves that are adapted to cold, windy environments. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
