It features dense, compact growth with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped white flowers during the winter months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
