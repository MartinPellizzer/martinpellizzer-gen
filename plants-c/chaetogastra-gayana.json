    "intro": "Chaetogastra gayana, commonly known as the African star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is adapted to arid conditions and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, although it is sometimes considered invasive in certain regions."
