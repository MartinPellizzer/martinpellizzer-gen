    "intro": "Colchicum stevenii, commonly known as the Steven's autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Colchicaceae and is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant produces a single, showy flower per stem, which is surrounded by two broad, leaf-like bracts. Its bulbs, which are its primary storage organs, contain toxic alkaloids and are used in traditional medicine. Colchicum stevenii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows at high elevations."
