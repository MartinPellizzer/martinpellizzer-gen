It is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged leaves that form a dense, rosette-like structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
