    "intro": "Coreopsis variifolia, commonly known as the variable coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, daisy-like flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a central disk. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy texture. Coreopsis variifolia is a popular choice for gardeners due to its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
