    "intro": "Clethra licanioides, commonly known as sweet pepperbush, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, elliptic leaves that are typically 2\u20135 inches long and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in cymes during late spring to early summer. These flowers are clustered in terminal panicles and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The shrub also produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans."
