    "intro": "Castilleja oreopola var. subintegra, commonly known as the Sierra castilleja, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces bright orange to red flowers, which are typically arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Castilleja oreopola var. subintegra plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
