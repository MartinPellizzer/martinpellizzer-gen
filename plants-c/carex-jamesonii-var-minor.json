    "intro": "Carex jamesonii var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf swamp sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in marshy areas, along stream banks, and in poorly drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often dark green and slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is notable for its compact size and ability to thrive in moist, acidic conditions."
