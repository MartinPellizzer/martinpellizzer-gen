    "intro": "Cyathea mesosora, commonly known as the small-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately divided fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 6 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizome system is robust, allowing it to anchor firmly in moist, shaded environments. Cyathea mesosora is often found in coastal and lowland forests, where it thrives in humid, nutrient-rich soils."
