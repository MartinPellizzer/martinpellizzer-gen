It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, often dispersed by wind. Colubrina nipensis is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats."
