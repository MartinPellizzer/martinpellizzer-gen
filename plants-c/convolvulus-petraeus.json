    "intro": "Convolvulus petraeus, commonly known as the rock convolvulus, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing annual or perennial herb characterized by its trailing stems and small, funnel-shaped flowers. The plant produces purple or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically alternate, simple, and have a hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Convolvulus petraeus is often found in sandy soils and can thrive in poor, well-drained conditions."
