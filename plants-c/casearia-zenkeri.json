    "intro": "Casearia zenkeri, commonly known as the African snowball or white-flowered casearia, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in spring, giving it a snowball-like appearance. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Casearia zenkeri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some African countries."
