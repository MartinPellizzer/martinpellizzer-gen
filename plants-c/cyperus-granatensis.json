It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often forming dense clusters near water bodies. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are arranged in a triangular cross-section, a characteristic feature of many Cyperaceae species.
