It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spikes of yellowish-green flowers in the summer. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and marshy areas. It has fibrous roots and rhizomes that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for wetland gardens and ecological restoration projects."
