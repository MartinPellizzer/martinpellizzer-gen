    "intro": "Cereus pasacana, commonly known as the Pasacana cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile. It is a columnar cactus with a tall, slender stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant features spiny areoles and produces yellow flowers that bloom at night, a characteristic of many cacti in the Cereus genus. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water."
