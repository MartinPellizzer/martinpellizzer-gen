It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bright yellow flowers with purple or brown markings. Its inflorescence is a composite head, characteristic of the Asteraceae family. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller, more compact flowers compared to the typical form of Centaurea pratensis."
