    "intro": "Calamagrostis tolucensis, commonly known as the Tol\u00facense reed, is a perennial grass native to the tropical regions of Central America. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has tall, slender stalks that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, with narrow, blade-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a panicle, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. This species plays an important ecological role in its native environment by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
