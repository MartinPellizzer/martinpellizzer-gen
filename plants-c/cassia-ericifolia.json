It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow, fragrant flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elongated, flat pods containing small, dark brown seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Cassia ericifolia is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and is also valued for its potential medicinal properties."
