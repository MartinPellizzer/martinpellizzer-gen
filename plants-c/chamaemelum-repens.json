    "intro": "Chamaemelum repens, commonly known as yarrow, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, branching stems and small, fern-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its flowers are arranged in flat-topped clusters called cymes, and it is known for its strong, aromatic scent. Chamaemelum repens is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, and it has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
