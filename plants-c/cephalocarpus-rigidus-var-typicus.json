    "intro": "Cephalocarpus rigidus var. typicus, commonly known as the rigid-headed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically rigid and upright, forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and ecological role in its native habitat. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
