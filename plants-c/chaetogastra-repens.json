    "intro": "Chaetogastra repens, commonly known as the creeping chaetogastra, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats on the ground, often in moist or semi-shaded environments. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, and it is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and ecologically significant species."
