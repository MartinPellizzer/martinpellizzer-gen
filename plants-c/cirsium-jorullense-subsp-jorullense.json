    "intro": "Cirsium jorullense subsp. jorullense, commonly known as the Jorullense thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It has a compact growth habit with a rosette of basal leaves and a flowering stem that can reach up to 50 cm in height. Due to its restricted distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
