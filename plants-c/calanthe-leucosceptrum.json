    "intro": "Calanthe leucosceptrum, commonly known as the white-tipped calanthe, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen, and it produces striking white flowers with a distinctive yellow lip. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. It is often found in shaded forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
