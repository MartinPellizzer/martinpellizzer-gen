    "intro": "Calinux, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant contains toxic compounds, including cardiac glycosides, which can be harmful if ingested. Calinux thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical features make it both a subject of botanical study and a plant to be handled with care."
