    "intro": "Cerastium orophyllum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically reaches heights of 5 to 15 centimeters and features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in a raceme. Its flowers have four petals and are typically pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. Cerastium orophyllum thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes."
