    "intro": "Cardamine nakaiana, commonly known as the Japanese water shield, is a small herbaceous plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively in wetland environments. Cardamine nakaiana thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds."
