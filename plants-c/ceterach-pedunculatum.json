    "intro": "Ceterach pedunculatum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southern United States. It is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy, saline soils, often found in dune environments. The plant features distinctive blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Ceterach pedunculatum plays an important ecological role by stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
