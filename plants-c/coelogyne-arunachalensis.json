It is characterized by its vibrant, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often displaying shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte on trees, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are strap-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also of interest in botanical research due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments."
