It is a perennial grass native to regions of southern Africa, particularly in South Africa. The plant is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a vibrant green color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or along the edges of water bodies. This ornamental grass is valued for its fine texture and ability to form dense, low-growing clumps."
