    "intro": "Calophyllum heterophyllum, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. The plant has opposite, simple, and often elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green in color. Its small, yellowish flowers are followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits that contain a single seed. This species plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
