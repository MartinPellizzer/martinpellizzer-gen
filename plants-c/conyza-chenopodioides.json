    "intro": "Conyza chenopodioides, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is an annual herb with a taproot system that allows it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are usually oblanceolate, with a hairy surface that aids in reducing water loss. Sandmat is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain ecosystems."
