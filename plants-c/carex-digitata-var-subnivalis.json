    "intro": "Carex digitata var. subnivalis, commonly known as the subnival sedge, is a perennial plant native to high-altitude environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its growth is typically limited to cool, temperate climates where it can withstand frost and snow cover. The plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine organisms."
