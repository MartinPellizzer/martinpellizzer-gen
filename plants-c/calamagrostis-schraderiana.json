    "intro": "Calamagrostis schraderiana, commonly known as Schrader's reed, is a perennial grass native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces tall, cylindrical inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its flowering period makes it a valuable species for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Calamagrostis schraderiana is also used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
