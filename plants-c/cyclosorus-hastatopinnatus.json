    "intro": "Cyclosorus hastatopinnatus, commonly known as the broad-leafed water clover, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It features a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread across the substrate in shallow water environments. The plant has broad, lobed leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, often with a distinctive notched or scalloped edge. Its small, greenish-white flowers are typically borne on short stalks above the water surface. Cyclosorus hastatopinnatus plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
