    "intro": "Cleistogenes caespitosa var. ramosa, commonly known as the tufted bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It forms dense, clump-forming tufts with short, stiff blades and often produces dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and is adapted to a variety of soil types, including sandy and clay soils. It is often found in open areas, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its drought tolerance and fine texture make it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental landscaping."
