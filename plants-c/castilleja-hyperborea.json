    "intro": "Castilleja hyperborea, commonly known as the alpine milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the western United States and southern Canada. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Castilleja hyperborea thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine habitats."
