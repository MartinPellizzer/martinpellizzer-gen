    "intro": "Cereus aggregatus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces striking, fragrant white flowers that open at night and remain open for only one night. These flowers are typically borne at the ends of the stems and are followed by small, red berries. Cereus aggregatus is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
