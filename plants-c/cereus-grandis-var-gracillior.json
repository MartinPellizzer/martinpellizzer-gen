It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements. The flowers are typically short-lived but highly ornamental, making it a popular choice for desert gardens."
