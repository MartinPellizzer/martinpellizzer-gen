    "intro": "Crocus pallasii subsp. haussknechtii, commonly known as the Pallas' crocus subspecies Haussknechtii, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, typically blooming in early spring. The plant produces a single, upright stem that supports its showy inflorescence, which consists of several florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette that helps conserve moisture in its arid habitat. This subspecies is valued for its horticultural appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
