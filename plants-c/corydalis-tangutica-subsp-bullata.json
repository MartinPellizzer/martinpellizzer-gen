    "intro": "Corydalis tangutica subsp. bullata, commonly known as the Tibetan fritillary, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and western China. It features slender, branched stems that grow up to 30 cm in height, adorned with lanceolate, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowers have a distinctive spurred structure, typical of the Fumariaceae family, and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
