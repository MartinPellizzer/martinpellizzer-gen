    "intro": "Cicuta maculata var. maculata, commonly known as water hemlock, is a toxic member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant contains potent toxins, including cicutoxin, which can be lethal to humans and animals. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. Due to its high toxicity, it is often considered one of the most dangerous plants in North America."
