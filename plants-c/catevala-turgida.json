    "intro": "Catevala turgida, commonly known as the inflated bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its inflated, sac-like structures that help it float. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is native to freshwater habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is known for its ability to trap small aquatic organisms, using its bladder-like structures to create a vacuum. Its botanical features include small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, and it reproduces both sexually and asexually. Catevala turgida plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
