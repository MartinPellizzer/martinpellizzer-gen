    "intro": "Cactus micans, commonly known as the silver leaf cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It features a sprawling, low-growing structure with thick, ribbed stems that store water efficiently. The plant's leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores. Its flowers, which appear in shades of yellow to orange, bloom during the warmer months. Cactus micans thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping."
