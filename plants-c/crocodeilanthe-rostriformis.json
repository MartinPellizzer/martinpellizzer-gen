    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe rostriformis, commonly known as the rostriform staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that resemble the head of a crocodile, giving it its distinctive common name. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and typically grows on trees or rocks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Crocodeilanthe rostriformis is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded, moist gardens."
