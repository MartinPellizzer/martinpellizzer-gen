    "intro": "Casearia rugulosa, commonly known as the rough-leaved casearia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves with a rough, textured surface and a distinctive reddish-brown underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by orange to red berries containing one or two seeds. Casearia rugulosa is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal. It has also been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
