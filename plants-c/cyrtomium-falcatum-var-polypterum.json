    "intro": "Cyrtomium falcatum var. polypterum, commonly known as the broad-leaf holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are typically broad and lance-shaped. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
