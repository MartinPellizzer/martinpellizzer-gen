    "intro": "Crepidium ternatense, commonly known as the Ternate orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
