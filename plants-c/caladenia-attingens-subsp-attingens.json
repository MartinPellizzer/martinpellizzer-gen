    "intro": "Caladenia attingens subsp. attingens, commonly known as the Sturt's Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to South Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, pale green to cream-colored flowers with a distinctive red or purple lip. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, often in sandy or gravelly soils. It is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological specificity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
