    "intro": "Cyclophorus macropodus, commonly known as the giant cyclophorus, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its large, feather-like leaves that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in humid, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
