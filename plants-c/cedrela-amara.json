    "intro": "Cedrela amara, commonly known as the yellow cedar or Brazilian mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, elongated fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
