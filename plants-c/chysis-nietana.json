    "intro": "Chysis nietana, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, emitting a strong scent to attract pollinators. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, round fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil. Due to its nocturnal blooming habit, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique flowering behavior."
