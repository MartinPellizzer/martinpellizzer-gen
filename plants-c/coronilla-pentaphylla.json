    "intro": "Coronilla pentaphylla, commonly known as the five-leafed crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with five leaflets and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, and it is often found in dry, rocky soils. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in ecological restoration projects. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules also enriches the soil."
