    "intro": "Cerastium insubricum, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cerastium insubricum is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is adaptable to a variety of soil types."
