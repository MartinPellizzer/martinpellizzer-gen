    "intro": "Cyclea kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu cyclea, is a rare flowering plant endemic to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the family Solanaceae, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to the cool, moist climate of the mountain's summit, where it grows in rocky, well-drained soil. Its leaves are ovate and covered in a fine pubescence, and it produces berries that are typically red when mature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclea kinabaluensis is considered a vulnerable species."
