    "intro": "Carex alba, commonly known as white sedge, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands. Carex alba is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
