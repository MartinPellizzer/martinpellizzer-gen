    "intro": "Cypripedium margaritaceum subsp. fargesii, commonly known as the Farges' lady's slipper, is a rare and ornate orchid native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a pouch-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows in cool, moist forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this subspecies is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
