    "intro": "Colymbada graeca, commonly known as the Greek water clover, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater habitats of Greece. It features delicate, floating leaves that are deeply lobed, resembling the shape of a clover, and are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in the spring, typically on long, slender stems. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters with abundant sunlight and is often found in marshes and ponds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
