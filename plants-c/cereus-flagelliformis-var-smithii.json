    "intro": "Cereus flagelliformis var. smithii, commonly known as the \"ghost plant,\" is a unique cacti species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its long, thin, branching stems that resemble tendrils, which can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, white, nocturnal flowers that bloom during the summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. Due to its striking appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for collectors and enthusiasts of unusual succulents."
