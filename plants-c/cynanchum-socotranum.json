    "intro": "Cynanchum socotranum, commonly known as Socotra milkweed, is a unique plant native to the Arabian Peninsula, particularly Socotra Island. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, characterized by its woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its milky sap, which is toxic, is a distinguishing feature of the species. Cynanchum socotranum plays a role in the local ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a habitat for various insects."
