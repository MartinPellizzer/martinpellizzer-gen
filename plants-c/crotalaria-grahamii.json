    "intro": "Crotalaria grahamii, commonly known as the Graham's crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. It produces small, elliptical pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Crotalaria grahamii is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient conditions, making it a resilient species in arid regions."
