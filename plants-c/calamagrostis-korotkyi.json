    "intro": "Calamagrostis korotkyi, commonly known as the Siberian reed, is a perennial grass native to Siberia and parts of northern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color. This plant thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and along riverbanks. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-based flowers. Calamagrostis korotkyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
