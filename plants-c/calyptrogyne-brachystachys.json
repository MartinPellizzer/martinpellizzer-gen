    "intro": "Calyptrogyne brachystachys, commonly known as the small-stalked sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a shrub that typically grows in saline or brackish environments, often found in mangrove swamps and salt marshes. The plant has palmate leaves with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in its harsh habitat. Its flowers are usually pink or red, with five petals and a prominent central stamen, and it produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds. Calyptrogyne brachystachys plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and provides habitat for various small aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
