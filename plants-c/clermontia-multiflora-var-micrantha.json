    "intro": "Clermontia multiflora var. micrantha, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 silversword, is a rare endemic plant native to the island of Maui in Hawaii. It is characterized by its rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves that form a dense, compact structure. The plant produces a single, branched stem that bears small, white, five-petaled flowers. It thrives in the harsh, high-elevation environments of the Haleakal\u0101 volcano. Due to its limited habitat and conservation status, it is considered a critically endangered species."
