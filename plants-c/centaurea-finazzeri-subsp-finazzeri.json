    "intro": "Centaurea finazzeri subsp. finazzeri, commonly known as the Finazzeri's thistle, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
