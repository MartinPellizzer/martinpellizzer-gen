    "intro": "Cheilanthes kunzei, commonly known as the rock fern or desert shield fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial plant that thrives in rocky soils and crevices, often growing on cliffs or in dry, shaded areas. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with tightly packed fronds that help reduce water loss. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, adapted to conserve moisture. Cheilanthes kunzei is known for its resilience to drought and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
