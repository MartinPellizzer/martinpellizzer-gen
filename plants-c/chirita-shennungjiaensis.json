The plant is endemic to a specific region, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. It thrives in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
