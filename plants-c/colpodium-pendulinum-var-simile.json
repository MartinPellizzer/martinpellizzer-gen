    "intro": "Colpodium pendulinum var. simile, commonly known as the pendant bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic organisms, aiding in nutrient absorption. The plant has thin, branching stems that often hang over water, giving it a delicate appearance. Its flowers are typically greenish-white and clustered in dense inflorescences. This variant is closely related to other species in the genus Colpodium, sharing similar ecological adaptations."
