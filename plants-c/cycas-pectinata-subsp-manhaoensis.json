    "intro": "Cycas pectinata subsp. manhaoensis, commonly known as the Manhao cycas, is a rare cycad species native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like leaves that are pinnately compound and have a dark green color. The plant produces cones, with male cones typically appearing at the base of the trunk and female cones higher up. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
