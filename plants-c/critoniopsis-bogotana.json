    "intro": "Critoniopsis bogotana, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Andean region of Colombia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests and rocky outcrops. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies in its natural habitat. The spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Polypodiaceae family."
