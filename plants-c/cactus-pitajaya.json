    "intro": "Cactus pitajaya, commonly known as the \"devil's backbone,\" is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It features a tall, spiny stem that can grow up to several meters in height, with small, paddle-shaped leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the warmer months, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The pitajaya is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
