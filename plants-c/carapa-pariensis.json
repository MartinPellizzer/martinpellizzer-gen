    "intro": "Carapa pariensis, commonly known as the Amazonian mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its large, compound leaves and showy yellow flowers. The tree produces small, round fruits that contain hard, woody seeds. It is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and construction. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in its natural habitat."
