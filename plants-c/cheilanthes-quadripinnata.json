    "intro": "Cheilanthes quadripinnata, commonly known as the four-pinnate rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant has a distinctive frond structure with multiple pinnae, giving it a feathery appearance. It produces spores in small, clustered sori located on the underside of its fronds. This fern is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species in its native habitat."
