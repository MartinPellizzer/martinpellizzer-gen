    "intro": "Clusia clusioides, commonly known as the waxleaf clusia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by orange or red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Clusia clusioides is also valued for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and air pollution."
