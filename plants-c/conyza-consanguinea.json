    "intro": "Conyza consanguinea, commonly known as the common blueweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It typically grows in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions. Conyza consanguinea is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, showing adaptability to various soil types."
