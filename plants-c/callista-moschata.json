    "intro": "Callista moschata, commonly known as the musk orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its fragrant, showy flowers that emit a sweet, musky scent. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Callista moschata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and tropical landscapes."
