    "intro": "Cypripedium rubronerve, commonly known as the red-veined lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spiral arrangement of pale green to white flowers. The plant produces a single, elongated spike of flowers with showy, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and wasps. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant. Cypripedium rubronerve thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks."
