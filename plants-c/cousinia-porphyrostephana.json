    "intro": "Cousinia porphyrostephana, commonly known as the purple steppe cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, harsh environments. It has basal leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Cousinia porphyrostephana is often found in steppe and desert habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
