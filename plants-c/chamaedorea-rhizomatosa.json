It is a clump-forming plant with slender, upright stems that produce clusters of elongated, leathery leaves. The plant has a rhizomatous root system, which allows it to spread and form dense thickets. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity and well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value and ease of care, it is a popular houseplant."
