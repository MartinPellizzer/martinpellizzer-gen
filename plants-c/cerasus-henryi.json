    "intro": "Cerasus henryi, commonly known as the Chinese cherry or Henry's cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to cherries but are typically less sweet. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while its bark is reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age. Cerasus henryi is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
