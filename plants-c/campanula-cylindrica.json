    "intro": "Campanula cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture. Campanula cylindrica is well-suited for rock gardens and borders due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
