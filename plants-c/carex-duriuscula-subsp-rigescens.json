    "intro": "Carex duriuscula subsp. rigescens, commonly known as rigid sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This subspecies typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. The plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
