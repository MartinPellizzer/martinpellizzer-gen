    "intro": "Coffea dubardii, commonly known as the Dubard's coffee, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Rubiaceae family. It is native to Madagascar, where it grows in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant produces small, red berries that contain smooth, oval-shaped seeds used for coffee production. Unlike more common coffee species, Coffea dubardii is not widely cultivated due to its limited availability and specific growing conditions. Its unique flavor profile and rarity make it a subject of interest for specialty coffee enthusiasts and researchers."
