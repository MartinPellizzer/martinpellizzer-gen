It features alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically pubescent and have a slightly succulent texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, and its fruit is a dry, three-angled achene with a tuft of silky hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant is sometimes considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
