    "intro": "Cynanchum myrianthum, commonly known as the many-flowered dogbane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its milky sap. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring opposite, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Cynanchum myrianthum is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
