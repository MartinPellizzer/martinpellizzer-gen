    "intro": "Convolvulus aridus subsp. tenuifolius, commonly known as the slenderleaf morning glory, is a drought-tolerant shrub native to arid regions of Australia. It features small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, which bloom in the early morning. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss, an adaptation to its harsh environment. It produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. This species is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to low-nutrient conditions."
