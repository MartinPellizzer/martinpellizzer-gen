    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 melanophthalmum, commonly known as the black-eyed lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers with a dark, velvety pouch that resembles an eye, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in cool, moist forest habitats and is known for its tall, slender stems and broad, leathery leaves. It produces a single, fragrant flower per stem, which is usually pink or purple in color. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable and often endangered species in its native range."
