    "intro": "Calanthe melinosema, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with dense, grass-like leaves that form a rosette. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers. Its flowers are arranged in a loose spike and are often fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Calanthe melinosema is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden environments."
