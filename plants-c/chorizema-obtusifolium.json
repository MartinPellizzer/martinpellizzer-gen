    "intro": "Chorizema obtusifolium, commonly known as the woolly mountain lily, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and striking white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are broad and rounded, with a soft, fuzzy texture that helps retain moisture. It is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
