    "intro": "Cynoglossum creticum f. pallidum, commonly known as the pale hound's tongue, is a rare and striking plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, tongue-shaped leaves and showy blue-violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, white or pale green down, giving it a soft, almost ethereal appearance. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of interest in horticultural and ecological studies."
