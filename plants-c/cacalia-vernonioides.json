    "intro": "Cacalia vernonioides, commonly known as the coastal bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Cacalia vernonioides is a hardy perennial that plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
