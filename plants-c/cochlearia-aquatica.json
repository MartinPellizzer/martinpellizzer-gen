    "intro": "Cochlearia aquatica, commonly known as water cochlearia, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other well-known plants such as cabbages and mustards. The plant is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and clusters of small, white or pink flowers. It thrives in moist, often saline environments, such as coastal areas and wetlands. Cochlearia aquatica is often found growing in shallow water or on damp soil, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
