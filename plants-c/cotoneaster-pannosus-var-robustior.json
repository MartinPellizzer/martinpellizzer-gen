    "intro": "Cotoneaster pannosus var. robustior, commonly known as the robust cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features small, elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes. The species is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils."
