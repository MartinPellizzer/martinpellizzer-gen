    "intro": "Castilleja henryae, commonly known as Henry's paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange tubular flowers. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
