    "intro": "Carpinus caroliniana subsp. caroliniana, commonly known as the American hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark that becomes fissured with age, and its alternate, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by small, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping and ecological restoration."
