    "intro": "Cipocereus pusilliflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a low-growing, branching cactus with cylindrical stems that are typically green and spiny. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its adaptations to desert conditions include reduced leaf surface and thick stems for water storage."
