    "intro": "Crepidium sarawakense, commonly known as the Sarawak orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or among leaf litter. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
