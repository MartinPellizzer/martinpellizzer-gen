    "intro": "Carludovica sulcata, commonly known as the Mexican jumping bean, is a unique plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often hollow fruit pods. The plant's most notable feature is the movement of the bean-like structures inside the pod, caused by the larvae of a specific moth species. Carludovica sulcata thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its botanical interest lies in its unusual morphology and the symbiotic relationship it shares with the moth larvae."
