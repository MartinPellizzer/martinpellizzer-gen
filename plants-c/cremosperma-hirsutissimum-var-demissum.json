    "intro": "Cremosperma hirsutissimum var. demissum, commonly known as the hairy acanthus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are densely covered with soft, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, spiny flowers in shades of purple and pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. This variety is less hairy than the typical form, giving it a slightly different appearance."
