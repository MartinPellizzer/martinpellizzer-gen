    "intro": "Centaurea visianii, commonly known as the Visianii knapweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its striking purple to pink bracts and yellow central disk, which resemble a composite flower head. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands. It has slender, branching stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy. Centaurea visianii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and drought tolerance."
