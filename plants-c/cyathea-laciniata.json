    "intro": "Cyathea laciniata, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are typically divided into narrow, lace-like segments, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Cyathea laciniata plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various forest organisms."
