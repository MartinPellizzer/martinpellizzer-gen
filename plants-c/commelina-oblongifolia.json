    "intro": "Commelina oblongifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf spiderwort, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It features slender, erect stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers clustered in umbels, which are typically surrounded by white, petal-like bracts. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Its flowering period extends from spring to early summer, making it a notable component of wetland flora."
