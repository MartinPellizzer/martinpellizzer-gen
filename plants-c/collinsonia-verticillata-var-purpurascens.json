    "intro": "Collinsonia verticillata var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purpleleaf bladdernut, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking purple foliage, which becomes more vibrant in the fall, and its showy, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces capsule-like fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a valuable addition to woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal color changes and unique plant structure."
