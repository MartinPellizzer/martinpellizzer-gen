    "intro": "Comocladia undulata, commonly known as the wavy sea grape, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its delicate, waxy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that turns from green to red as it matures. Comocladia undulata thrives in saline and brackish water environments, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
