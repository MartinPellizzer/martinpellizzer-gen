    "intro": "Camellia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved camellia, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia, particularly China and Japan. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces striking, double or semi-double flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Camellia parvifolia prefers acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. It is also valued for its evergreen foliage and ability to thrive in temperate climates."
