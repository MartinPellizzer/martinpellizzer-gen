    "intro": "Chusquea intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate bamboo, is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a clumping bamboo that typically grows in moist, shaded environments at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. The plant features slender, hollow stems that are often used in traditional crafts and construction. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture that helps it retain moisture. Chusquea intermedia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions."
