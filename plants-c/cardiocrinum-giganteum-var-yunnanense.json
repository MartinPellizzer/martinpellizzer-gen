    "intro": "Cardiocrinum giganteum var. yunnanense, commonly known as the Yunnan giant lily, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable and somewhat endangered species in its native region."
