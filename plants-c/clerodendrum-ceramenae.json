    "intro": "Clerodendrum ceramenae, commonly known as the red-flowered clerodendrum, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often marked with longitudinal ridges, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight."
