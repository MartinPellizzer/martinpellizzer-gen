It is characterized by its striking, often fragrant, flower spikes that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces multiple flowers along the inflorescence, typically in shades of white, yellow, and red. Its pseudobulbs are clustered and covered with a thick, fibrous sheath. Coelogyne transversa thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
