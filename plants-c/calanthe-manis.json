    "intro": "Calanthe manis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf calanthe, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its striking, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Calanthe manis is often found in shaded, moist forest environments, where it thrives in the undergrowth. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to anchor firmly in the soil while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding environment."
