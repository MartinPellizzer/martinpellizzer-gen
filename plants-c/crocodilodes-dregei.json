    "intro": "Crocodilodes dregei, commonly known as the African crocodile fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Osmundaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that resemble the scales of a crocodile, hence its common name. The plant is typically found in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded, humid environments. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the undersides of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
