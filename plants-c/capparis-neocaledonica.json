    "intro": "Capparis neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonia caper, is a flowering plant native to the island of New Caledonia in the South Pacific. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and lowland areas, often in sandy or limestone soils. The plant features small, waxy leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-white flowers that are highly fragrant. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that contain small, hard seeds. Capparis neocaledonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also of interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations to its native environment."
