    "intro": "Costus nigricans, commonly known as black costus, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a member of the Zingiberaceae family, which includes ginger and turmeric, and is characterized by its aromatic, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces striking, sword-shaped leaves and tall, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, tubular flowers. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal potential, it is cultivated in warm climates for both horticultural and therapeutic purposes."
