    "intro": "Coleonema rubrum, commonly known as the red-flowered prostrate cotoneaster, is a shrub native to South Africa. It features small, oval leaves that are typically gray-green in color and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bright red flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils."
