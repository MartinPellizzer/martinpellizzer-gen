    "intro": "Cenchrus hexaflorus, commonly known as the six-flowered grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. Its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions contributes to its widespread distribution and ecological significance."
