    "intro": "Chamaeraphis prostrata, commonly known as sand spurry, is a low-growing annual plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its prostrate or spreading growth habit, with small, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or coastal environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a common weed in agricultural and garden settings."
