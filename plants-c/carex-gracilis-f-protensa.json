It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. Its botanical features include a rhizomatous root system and small, wind-pollinated flowers. This sedges are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
