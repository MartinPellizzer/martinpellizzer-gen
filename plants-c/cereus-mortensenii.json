    "intro": "Cereus mortensenii, commonly known as the Mortensen's candleplant, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are covered in white, woolly spines, which help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces large, showy white flowers at night, which are pollinated by moths. These flowers are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds. Cereus mortensenii is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, with a deep root system and the ability to store water in its thick stems."
