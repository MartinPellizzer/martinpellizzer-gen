    "intro": "Cirsium japonicum var. spinossimum, commonly known as the Japanese thistle or prickly thistle, is a perennial plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and wastelands. Its hairy stems and sharply pointed leaves help it retain moisture and deter herbivores. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
