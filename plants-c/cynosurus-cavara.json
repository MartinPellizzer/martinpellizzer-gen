    "intro": "Cynosurus cavara, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, dark green leaves that are typically narrow and slightly curved. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Cynosurus cavara is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine texture and ability to form dense, low-growing turf."
