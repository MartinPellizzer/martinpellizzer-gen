    "intro": "Carex ustulata, commonly known as the scarlet sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features grass-like leaves that are dark green and often have a reddish or purplish tinge, especially along the edges. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Carex ustulata plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
