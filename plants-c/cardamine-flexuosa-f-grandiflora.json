    "intro": "Cardamine flexuosa f. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered water crowfoot, is a flowering plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, often shaded environments such as stream sides and wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
