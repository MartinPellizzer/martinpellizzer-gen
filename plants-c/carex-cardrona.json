    "intro": "Carex cardrona, commonly known as the cardrona sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as stream banks, marshes, and forest understories. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Carex cardrona is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes over 5,000 species of sedges. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and small vertebrates."
