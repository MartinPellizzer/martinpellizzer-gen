    "intro": "Clarionea humilis, commonly known as the lowland clarion, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of South America. It typically grows in marshy or swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features slender, creeping stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. Its flowers are pale blue or violet, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the late spring and early summer. Clarionea humilis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food and shelter for various insects and small aquatic creatures."
