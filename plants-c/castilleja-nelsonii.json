    "intro": "Castilleja nelsonii, commonly known as Nelson's paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, red to orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its host plants for nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its striking appearance makes it a notable species in ecological and botanical studies."
