    "intro": "Conyza stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaf fleabane, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, daisy-like flowers that typically bloom in the summer months. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Conyza stenophylla is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
