    "intro": "Cibotarium, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, slender stalks rising from water. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor it to the substrate. Its flowers are typically pink or white, with a unique structure that allows for pollination by both water and insects. The cibotarium is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its cultural and medicinal significance in various traditions."
