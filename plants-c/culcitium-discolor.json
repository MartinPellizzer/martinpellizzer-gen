    "intro": "Culcitium discolor, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers and its ability to grow on tree branches without soil, making it an epiphytic plant. The plant lacks traditional roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its stems and leaves. Its delicate appearance and limited distribution have made it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Culcitium discolor is considered endangered in many regions."
