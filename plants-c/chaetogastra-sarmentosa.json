It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit, with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, hairy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it is often found in moist, shaded environments."
