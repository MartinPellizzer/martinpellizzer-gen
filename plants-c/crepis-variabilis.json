    "intro": "Crepis variabilis, commonly known as the variable hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it is known for its yellow ray florets and spiky central disk. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with rough textures, and the plant can vary in height depending on environmental conditions. Crepis variabilis is often found in temperate climates and is relatively hardy, making it a common sight in wildflower gardens."
