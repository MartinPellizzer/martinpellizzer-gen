    "intro": "Crepidium keysseri, commonly known as the Keyser's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, often densely packed inflorescence. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, favoring rich, humusy soils. Its flowers are usually small, with intricate patterns of color and texture, often featuring a lip that is distinctly shaped. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
