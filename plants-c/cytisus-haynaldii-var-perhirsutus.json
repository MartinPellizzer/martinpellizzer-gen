    "intro": "Cytisus haynaldii var. perhirsutus, commonly known as the hairy broom, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which gives it its varietal name. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
