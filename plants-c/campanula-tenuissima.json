    "intro": "Campanula tenuissima, commonly known as the slender bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which help it thrive in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks. Campanula tenuissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its charming, dainty appearance."
