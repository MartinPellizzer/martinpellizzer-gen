    "intro": "Collophora, commonly known as the water bead plant, is a genus of small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plants. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent, and often gelatinous structures that resemble tiny water beads. These plants typically grow in moist environments such as ponds, marshes, and damp soil. Collophora species are known for their unique ability to absorb and retain water, which helps them survive in wet habitats. Their botanical features include small, leaf-like structures and specialized cells that aid in water retention."
