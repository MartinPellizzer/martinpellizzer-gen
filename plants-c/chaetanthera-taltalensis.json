    "intro": "Chaetanthera taltalensis, commonly known as the Taltal moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of northern Chile. It is characterized by its nocturnal blooming habit, with large, showy white flowers that open at night. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and features hairy stems and leaves. Its flowers emit a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Due to its limited distribution and unique ecological role, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
