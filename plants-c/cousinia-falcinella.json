It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers in composite flower heads, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold, arid climates. Cousinia falcinella is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
