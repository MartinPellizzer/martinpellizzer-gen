    "intro": "Calanthe hattorii, commonly known as the Hattori's calanthe, is a rare and elegant orchid native to Japan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, where it thrives on the forest floor. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, feature a unique coloration with white petals and a deep purple lip. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calanthe hattorii is considered a conservation concern."
