    "intro": "Colutea frigida, commonly known as the alpine bladder-nut, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that enclose kidney-shaped seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is often found in high-altitude meadows. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value and ecological interest."
