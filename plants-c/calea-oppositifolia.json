    "intro": "Calea oppositifolia, commonly known as the \"flower of the night,\" is a striking plant native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy white or pink flowers that open at night and close during the day. The plant has a distinctive rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers emit a sweet, fragrant scent that attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Calea oppositifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
