    "intro": "Cicuta purpurata, commonly known as purple water hemlock, is a highly toxic member of the Apiaceae family. It is a biennial plant that typically grows in wetlands and along stream banks, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are fern-like, with a distinctive purple hue on the underside, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters. The plant contains potent toxins, including cicutoxin, which can be lethal to humans and animals. Due to its extreme toxicity, it is considered one of the most dangerous plants in North America."
