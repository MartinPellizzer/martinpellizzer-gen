    "intro": "Corydalis tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Corydalis tomentosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
