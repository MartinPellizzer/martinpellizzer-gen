    "intro": "Carex xanthophysa var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf golden sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright yellow to golden green in color, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous brownish flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense spikes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
