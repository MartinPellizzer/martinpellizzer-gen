    "intro": "Cirsium boninense, commonly known as the Bonin thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Bonin Islands in the Pacific Ocean. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and spiny leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal and rocky habitats, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its island home. Its leaves are covered in stiff, prickly hairs, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Cirsium boninense is notable for its pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer and attract various pollinators."
