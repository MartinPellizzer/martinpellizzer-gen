    "intro": "Calyptropsidium, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a velvety texture. Calyptropsidium species are typically annual or biennial herbs, often found in disturbed soils and agricultural fields. They produce small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. The genus is native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas."
