    "intro": "Clausena calciphila, commonly known as the limestone apple tree, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in calcareous soils, making it well-adapted to rocky and limestone-rich environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are small, round, and resemble apples, hence the common name. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a distinctive glossy appearance."
