    "intro": "Carex canescens var. congesta, commonly known as the tufted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant prefers moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. It has fibrous roots and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered with a fine, white bloom. This variety is notable for its clumping growth habit and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
