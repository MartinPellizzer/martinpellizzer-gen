    "intro": "Cyclorhiza edosmoides, commonly known as the slender cycad, is a species of cycad native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, typical of gymnosperms, and has a long lifespan. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is often found in protected natural habitats."
