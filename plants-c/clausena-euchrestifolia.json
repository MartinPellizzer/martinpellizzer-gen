    "intro": "Clausena euchrestifolia, commonly known as the yellow-leafed klipspringer, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features narrow, leathery leaves that are often tinged with yellow or reddish hues. Its small, fragrant flowers are followed by yellow or orange berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
