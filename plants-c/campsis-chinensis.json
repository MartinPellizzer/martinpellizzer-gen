    "intro": "Campsis chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese trumpetflower, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its striking, tubular, orange-red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Campsis chinensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
