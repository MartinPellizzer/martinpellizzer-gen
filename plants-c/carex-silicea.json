    "intro": "Carex silicea, commonly known as silica sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers. Carex silicea typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
