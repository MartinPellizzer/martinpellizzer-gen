It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other members like mustard and cabbage. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its small, heart-shaped leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces clusters of tiny white flowers in early spring.
