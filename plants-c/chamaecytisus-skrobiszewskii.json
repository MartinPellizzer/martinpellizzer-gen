    "intro": "Chamaecytisus skrobiszewskii, commonly known as the Skrobiszewski broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe, particularly found in regions of Spain and Portugal. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has leathery, evergreen leaves that are typically arranged in pairs along the branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or coastal environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
