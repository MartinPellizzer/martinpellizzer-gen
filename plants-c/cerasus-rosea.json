    "intro": "Cerasus rosea, commonly known as the Japanese cherry tree, is a species of Prunus native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring, preceding the development of its foliage. The plant typically grows as a small deciduous tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a pointed tip and serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall. The fruit, a small cherry, is edible but less commonly consumed compared to other cherry species."
