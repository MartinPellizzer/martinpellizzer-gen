It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested or alpine environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the sedge family.
