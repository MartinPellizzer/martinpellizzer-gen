    "intro": "Cryptophoranthus lepidotus, commonly known as the velvetleaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that give it its common name, and its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
