    "intro": "Crataegus irrasa var. divergens, commonly known as the variable hawthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical, with serrated edges, and the fruit is a small, red-pink pome that ripens in late summer. This variety is notable for its variability in leaf shape and flower size, which contributes to its common name. It is often found in woodland edges and rocky soils, thriving in temperate climates."
