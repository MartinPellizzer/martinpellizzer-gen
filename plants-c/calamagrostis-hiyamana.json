    "intro": "Calamagrostis hiyamana, commonly known as the Japanese feather grass, is a perennial grass native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, arching blades that form dense clumps, often reaching heights of 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces feathery plumes in late summer, which are a striking feature in ornamental gardens. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Its foliage is typically a bluish-green color, adding a soft, elegant texture to landscapes."
