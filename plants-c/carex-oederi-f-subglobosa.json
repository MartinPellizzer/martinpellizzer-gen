    "intro": "Carex oederi f. subglobosa, commonly known as the globular sedge, is a compact, ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia. It features dense, rounded clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that give it a distinctive, tidy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are typically arranged in spikes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens or as a container plant. Its unique form and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for water garden edges and bog gardens."
