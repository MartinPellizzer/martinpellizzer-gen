    "intro": "Cocos nucifera var. iners, commonly known as the dwarf coconut palm, is a variety of the coconut tree characterized by its shorter stature and compact growth habit. It produces small, round coconuts that are typically harvested earlier than those of the standard coconut variety. The plant thrives in tropical climates with high temperatures and abundant rainfall, often found in coastal regions and low-lying areas. Its leaves are broad and feather-like, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is valued for both its ornamental use and its edible fruits, which are consumed fresh or processed into coconut products."
