    "intro": "Cirsium richterianum subsp. costae, commonly known as the coastal thistle, is a perennial plant native to coastal areas of western North America. It is characterized by its spiny, glandular leaves and purple to pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and dunes. It has a robust root system that helps stabilize coastal dunes and prevent erosion. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations to the harsh, windy coastal environment."
