    "intro": "Cardamine amara var. insecta, commonly known as the insect fern, is a rare and delicate herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typical of the mustard family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
