    "intro": "Crotalaria lunata, commonly known as the moonflower crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. The plant has palmate leaves with three to five leaflets, and its pods contain seeds that are often used in traditional medicine. Crotalaria lunata is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy species. However, it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care."
