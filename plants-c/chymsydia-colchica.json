    "intro": "Chymsydia colchica, commonly known as the Colchic Mountain Orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, preferring cool and humid conditions. It has a short flowering period, usually in late summer, and is adapted to the specific microclimates of its high-altitude habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
