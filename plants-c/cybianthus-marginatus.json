    "intro": "Cybianthus marginatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or coastal environments. The plant features small, pink or white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Cybianthus marginatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
