It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange flowers, which are typically smaller than those of the more common Calendula officinalis. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are lance-shaped with serrated edges. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and traditional herbal medicine."
