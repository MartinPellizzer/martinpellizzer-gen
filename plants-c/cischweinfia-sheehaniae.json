    "intro": "Cischweinfia sheehaniae, commonly known as the Sheehan's cischweinfia, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a contrasting red or purple throat. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and covered in a fine, velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
