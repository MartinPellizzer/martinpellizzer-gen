    "intro": "Cactus spini, commonly known as the spiny cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family, characterized by its succulent stems and spiny foliage. It typically features a cylindrical or globular shape with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, often yellow or white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its spines, which are modified leaves, serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores and also help reduce water loss by providing shade. Cactus spini is native to regions with dry climates, such as deserts and semi-arid areas, where it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
