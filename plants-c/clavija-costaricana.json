    "intro": "Clavija costaricana, commonly known as the Costa Rican clavija, is a flowering plant native to Central America, particularly Costa Rica. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, tropical environments and is often found in second-growth forests or along stream banks. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native region."
