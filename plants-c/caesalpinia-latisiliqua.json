    "intro": "Caesalpinia latisiliqua, commonly known as the broad-leaved cassia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are compound and consist of multiple pairs of small, oval leaflets. The plant produces bright yellow flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical spikes, which are often used in ornamental horticulture. Its fruit is a legume pod that contains several seeds, and the plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils. Caesalpinia latisiliqua is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment."
