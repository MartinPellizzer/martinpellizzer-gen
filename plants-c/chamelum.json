    "intro": "Chamelum, commonly known as the mimic octopus, is a unique marine creature rather than a plant, so it does not have botanical aspects. However, if you were referring to a plant, there might be confusion with the name. Please clarify if you meant a different species. If you intended to ask about a plant, kindly provide the correct name. I can't reply."
