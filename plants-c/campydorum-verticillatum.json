    "intro": "Campydorum verticillatum, commonly known as the whorled sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant has succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Campydorum verticillatum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and pollinators."
