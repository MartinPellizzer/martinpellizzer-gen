    "intro": "Cassia chacoensis, commonly known as the Chaco Cassia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in regions such as Paraguay and northern Argentina. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, open habitats. The plant produces bright yellow inflorescences, which are composed of numerous small, clustered flowers. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two sets of smaller leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. Cassia chacoensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage and floral display."
