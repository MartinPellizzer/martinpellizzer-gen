    "intro": "Commelina diffusa subsp. aquatica, commonly known as water commelina, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface and produces small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in moist or aquatic environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in wetland habitats. It is also known for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes, making it both a valuable wetland plant and a potential invasive species."
