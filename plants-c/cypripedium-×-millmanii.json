    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 millmanii, commonly known as the millmanii lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a large, pouch-like lip and vibrant pink or red petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, preferring rich, well-drained soil. It is a perennial herb with a rhizomatous root system and produces showy, fragrant blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
