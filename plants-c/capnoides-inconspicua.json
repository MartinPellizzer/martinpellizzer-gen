It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features small, delicate white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. Capnoides inconspicua is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological requirements."
