    "intro": "Conophytum velutinum, commonly known as the velvet conophytum, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a velvety texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated by succulent enthusiasts."
