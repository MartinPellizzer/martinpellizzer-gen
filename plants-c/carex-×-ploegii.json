    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 ploegii, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a hybrid between Carex lyngbyei and Carex echinata, characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wet meadows, and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, but the plant plays a role in supporting local insect and bird populations."
