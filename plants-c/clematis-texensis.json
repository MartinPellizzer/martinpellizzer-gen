    "intro": "Clematis texensis, commonly known as the Texas clematis, is a deciduous vine native to the southern United States. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are typically white or pale blue with five petals. The plant produces small, round berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil. Clematis texensis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to climb trellises or fences."
