    "intro": "Crotalaria macrostipula, commonly known as the large-leaf crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers with a spurred corolla and palmate leaves that are often large and lobed. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or bean family, and is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody pod, and the plant can grow as an annual or perennial depending on the climate. Crotalaria macrostipula is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value but can also be invasive in certain environments."
