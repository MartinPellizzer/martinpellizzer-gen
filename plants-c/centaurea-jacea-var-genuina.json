    "intro": "Centaurea jacea var. genuina, commonly known as the upright centaury, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features wiry, branched stems that can grow up to 60 cm in height, often with a reddish tinge. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with a distinctive purple or reddish center, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and arranged alternately along the stems. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden settings for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils."
