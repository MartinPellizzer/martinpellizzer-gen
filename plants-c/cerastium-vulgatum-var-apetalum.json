It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes."
