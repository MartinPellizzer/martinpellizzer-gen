It features erect stems that can grow up to 60 cm tall, covered in fine, hairy texture. The plant produces showy blue to violet flowers in racemes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and arranged alternately along the stem. Cherleria parnonia prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks."
