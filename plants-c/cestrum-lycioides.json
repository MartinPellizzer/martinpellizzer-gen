It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant produces small, toxic berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Cestrum lycioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
