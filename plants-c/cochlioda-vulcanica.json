    "intro": "Cochlioda vulcanica, commonly known as the volcanic cochlioda, is a rare and unique plant species native to volcanic regions. It is characterized by its striking, spiral-shaped leaves that resemble the patterns found in volcanic rock formations. The plant thrives in nutrient-rich, ash-laden soils and is often found near geothermal activity. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a distinct, spicy scent that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited habitat, Cochlioda vulcanica is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
