    "intro": "Carthamus alexandrinus, commonly known as the Egyptian safflower, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems and large, showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces bright red or orange seeds enclosed in a hairy capsule, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dye. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and often used in herbal remedies. The plant is also cultivated for its oil, which has applications in cosmetics and as a substitute for saffron."
