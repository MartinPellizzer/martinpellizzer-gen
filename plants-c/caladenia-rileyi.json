    "intro": "Caladenia rileyi, commonly known as Riley's spider orchid, is a striking orchid species native to southwestern Western Australia. It belongs to the orchid family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and intricate, spider-like floral structure. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as heathlands and woodlands. Its flowers, which are usually pale green to yellowish in color, bloom during the cooler months, often from late autumn to early spring. Caladenia rileyi is a protected species due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss."
