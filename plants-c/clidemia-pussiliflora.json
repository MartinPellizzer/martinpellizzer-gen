    "intro": "Clidemia pussiliflora, commonly known as the small-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and typically grows on the branches of other trees, drawing water and nutrients from its host. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers. Its fruits are usually small berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health of its host trees if left unchecked."
