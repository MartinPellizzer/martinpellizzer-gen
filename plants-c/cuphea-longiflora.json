    "intro": "Cuphea longiflora, commonly known as the firecracker plant, is a flowering shrub native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that resemble tiny firecrackers, hence its common name. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces, and it produces small, elliptical fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. Cuphea longiflora is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees."
