    "intro": "Carduus lusitanicus, commonly known as the Portuguese thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features a robust stem covered in spiny leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces purple to pink flowers with a central yellow disk, which bloom from summer to autumn. It thrives in dry, rocky, or disturbed soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Its spiny structure and medicinal properties have made it both a notable weed and a subject of traditional herbal use."
