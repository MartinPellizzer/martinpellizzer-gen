    "intro": "Centaurea paniculata var. brunnescens, commonly known as the brown centaury, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense, branched inflorescences of small, yellow to reddish-orange flowers, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy texture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in gardens for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils."
