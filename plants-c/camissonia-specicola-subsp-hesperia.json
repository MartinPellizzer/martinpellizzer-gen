    "intro": "Camissonia specicola subsp. hesperia, commonly known as the Hesperia camissonia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, often in coastal areas. It has a low-growing habit with linear leaves and produces capsules as its fruiting structure. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to its arid environment."
