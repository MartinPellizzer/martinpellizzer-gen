    "intro": "Calanthe tangmaiensis, commonly known as the Tangmai orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and parts of Myanmar. It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulbous structure, which stores water and nutrients. The plant features linear to lanceolate leaves and produces inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest for conservation efforts."
