    "intro": "Corydalis stolonifera, commonly known as the spreading corydalis, is a flowering plant native to Asia. It is characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit, producing runners that root at the nodes to form dense mats. The plant features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of small, nodding flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Corydalis stolonifera is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
