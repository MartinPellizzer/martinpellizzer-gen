It belongs to the family Menispermaceae and is characterized by its slender, woody stems that can twine around supports. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by distinctive, elongated fruits containing smooth, kidney-shaped seeds. Its leaves are typically palmately lobed, with a glossy surface and a somewhat waxy texture. Cissampelos vitis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
