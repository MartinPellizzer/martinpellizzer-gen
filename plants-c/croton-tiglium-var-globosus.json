    "intro": "Croton tiglium var. globosus, commonly known as the globular croton, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, globe-shaped seed capsules that give it its common name. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers and has palmate leaves with lobed margins. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its latex-producing species. Due to its toxic properties, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes rather than for medicinal use."
