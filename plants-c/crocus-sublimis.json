It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its compact, bulbous underground stem. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive, narrow shape during late winter to early spring. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge after the flowers. Crocus sublimis is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats."
