    "intro": "Cerastium purpurascens var. parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features prostrate or ascending stems covered in fine, soft hairs, and its leaves are typically oval to spoon-shaped with a hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are white or pale pink, often with a slight purple tinge, blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it is known for its rapid spread through seed dispersal."
