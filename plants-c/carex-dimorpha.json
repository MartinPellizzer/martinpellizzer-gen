It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered, with both male and female flowers present on the same plant, making it monoecious. Carex dimorpha plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
