    "intro": "Cylista albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered cylista, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features slender, upright stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbel-like clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Cylista albiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
