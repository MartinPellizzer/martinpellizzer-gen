It belongs to the Celastraceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by elliptical, orange-red berries. Its leaves are often narrow and pointed, giving it its common name, while its berries are a food source for various birds and small mammals. Celastrus acuminatus is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and stream banks."
