    "intro": "Cheiranthus \u00d7 silenifolius, commonly known as the silenifolius wallflower, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Cheiranthus cheiri and Cheiranthus sanguineus. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces showy, bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, silvery-green leaves that are often mistaken for those of the silen (Silenus) genus, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Botanically, it is a perennial herbaceous plant with a fibrous root system and is native to Europe and parts of Asia."
