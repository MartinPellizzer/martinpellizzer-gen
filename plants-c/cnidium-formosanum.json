    "intro": "Cnidium formosanum, commonly known as the Taiwan cnidium, is a perennial herb native to East Asia, particularly Taiwan. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic, often hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its roots are the primary part used in traditional medicine, valued for their purported medicinal properties. Cnidium formosanum is also noted for its ability to thrive in moist, shady environments, making it a common sight in forest understories."
