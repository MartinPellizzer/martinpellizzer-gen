    "intro": "Celastrus richardii var. elaeodendroides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved staff-vine, is a climbing shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Celastraceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange to red berries containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its ornamental value and medicinal potential have made it of interest in both horticulture and ethnobotanical studies."
