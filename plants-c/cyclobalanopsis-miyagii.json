    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis miyagii, commonly known as Miyagi's ironwood, is a species of evergreen tree native to Japan. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its hard, dense wood. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers followed by edible nuts enclosed in a thick, spiny husk. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
