    "intro": "Cerastium lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. Its leaves are lanceolate, with a pointed tip and a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its common name. Cerastium lanceolatum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks."
