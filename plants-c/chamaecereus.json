    "intro": "Chamaecereus, commonly known as the rock cactus, is a genus of cacti native to the Americas, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. These plants are characterized by their compact, often globular or cylindrical growth forms, and their ability to thrive in harsh, rocky environments. Chamaecereus species typically have a short, thick stem covered in spines, which help to reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Their flowers, when present, are usually small and can be white, yellow, or pink, blooming in spring or early summer. Many species are cultivated for their ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
