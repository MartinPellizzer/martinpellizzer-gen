    "intro": "Cyperus globosus subsp. humifusus, commonly known as the dwarf umbrella sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that resemble umbrellas, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often forming dense mats near water bodies. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in moist environments. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for wetland restoration and ornamental gardening."
