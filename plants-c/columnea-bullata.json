    "intro": "Columnea bullata, commonly known as the silver flame or red flame plant, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as a shrub or trailing vine, featuring velvety, dark green leaves with a glossy texture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Columnea bullata is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to bloom throughout the year under proper care."
