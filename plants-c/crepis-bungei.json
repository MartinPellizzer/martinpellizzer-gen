It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, grassy habitats and has small, oblong leaves. Its seeds are enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Crepis bungei is often found in mountainous regions and is adapted to arid conditions."
