It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are ovate and glossy, often with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture.
