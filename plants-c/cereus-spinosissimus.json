    "intro": "Cereus spinosissimus, commonly known as the spiny night bloomer, is a cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a tall, columnar plant that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its spiny, ribbed stems. The plant produces large, white, nocturnal flowers that open at night and emit a strong fragrance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for arid landscapes."
