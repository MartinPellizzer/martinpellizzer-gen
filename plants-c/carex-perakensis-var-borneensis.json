    "intro": "Carex perakensis var. borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Borneo. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes over 5,000 species of sedges, grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its morphology features narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variant is distinguished by its specific adaptations to the humid and often shaded conditions of its native habitat."
