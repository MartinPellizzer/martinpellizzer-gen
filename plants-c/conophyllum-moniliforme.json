    "intro": "Conophyllum moniliforme, commonly known as the bead lichen, is a unique lichen species characterized by its distinctive bead-like structure. It belongs to the family Caloplacaceae and is typically found growing on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant forms a crustose thallus with a granular appearance, composed of a symbiotic partnership between a fungus and a green alga. Its morphology includes small, rounded lobes that resemble beads, hence its common name. This lichen is often used as an indicator of environmental conditions due to its sensitivity to air pollution."
