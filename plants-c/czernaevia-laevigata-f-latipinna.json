    "intro": "Czernaevia laevigata f. latipinna, commonly known as the broad-leafed form of the species, is a rare and distinctive plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and a slightly hairy underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
