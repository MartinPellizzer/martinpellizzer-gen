    "intro": "Cordia hexandra, commonly known as the African star apple, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange to red, fleshy berries. The fruit is edible, with a sweet, juicy pulp that contains numerous seeds. It is often grown for its ornamental value and as a source of food in its native habitat."
