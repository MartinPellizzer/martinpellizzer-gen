    "intro": "Catevala subulata, commonly known as the slender leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its root system is adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil of its habitat. Catevala subulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
