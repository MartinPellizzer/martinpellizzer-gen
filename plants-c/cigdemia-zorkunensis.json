    "intro": "Cigdemia zorkunensis, commonly known as the Zorkun's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its delicate, pale green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing in shaded forest understories. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered endangered and requires careful protection."
