It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a mild, spicy aroma. Clinanthus fulvus is primarily of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
