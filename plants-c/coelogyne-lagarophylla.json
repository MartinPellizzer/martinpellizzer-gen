    "intro": "Coelogyne lagarophylla, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow and green floral structure, with long, slender petals and a prominent lip. The plant produces fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the summer months. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, typical of epiphytic growth. Coelogyne lagarophylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
