It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and woolly foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cousinia leptocladoides produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
