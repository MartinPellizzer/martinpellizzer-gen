    "intro": "Cardamine pulchra, commonly known as the beautiful water shield, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous perennial plant that typically grows in moist or aquatic environments. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a waxy, shield-like appearance, which helps it float on water surfaces. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with five petals and numerous stamens. Cardamine pulchra is often found in wetlands, ponds, and along the edges of streams."
