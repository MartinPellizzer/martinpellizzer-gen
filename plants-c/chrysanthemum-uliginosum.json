    "intro": "Chrysanthemum uliginosum, commonly known as the bog chrysanthemum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
