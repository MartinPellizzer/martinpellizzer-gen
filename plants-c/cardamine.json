    "intro": "Cardamine, commonly known as water shield, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. These plants are typically found in moist or aquatic environments, such as marshes and stream sides. They are characterized by their floating or submerged leaves, which help in photosynthesis in waterlogged areas. The flowers are small and white or yellow, often arranged in clusters. Cardamine species are also known for their edible leaves and seeds, which have been used in traditional cuisines."
