It is characterized by its distinctive helmet-like carapace, which provides protection against predators. This species typically inhabits rocky shores and tidal pools, where it can find shelter and food. Its diet consists mainly of algae and small organic debris. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is an important indicator species for coastal biodiversity."
