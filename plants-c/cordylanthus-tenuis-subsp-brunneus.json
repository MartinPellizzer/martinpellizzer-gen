    "intro": "Cordylanthus tenuis subsp. brunneus, commonly known as the slenderleaf filaree, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in open habitats such as grasslands and slopes."
