    "intro": "Carex riparia var. exaltata, commonly known as the tall riparian sedge, is a perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found along stream banks and in marshy areas. It has narrow, linear leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. This variety is distinguished by its taller growth habit compared to other Carex species, making it a distinctive feature in riparian habitats."
