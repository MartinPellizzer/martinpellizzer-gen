    "intro": "Cyathea carolihenrici, commonly known as the Carolihenrici's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant exhibits a unique growth pattern, with a thick, fibrous root system that helps anchor it in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle. Cyathea carolihenrici is often found in lowland rainforests, where it plays a role in maintaining soil stability and supporting local biodiversity."
