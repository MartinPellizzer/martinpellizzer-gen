    "intro": "Clarisia ilicifolia var. micranthera, commonly known as the dwarf clarisia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and requires well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value and compact size, it is often used in landscaping and as a container plant."
