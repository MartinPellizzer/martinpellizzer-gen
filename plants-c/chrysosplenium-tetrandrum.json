    "intro": "Chrysosplenium tetrandrum, commonly known as the four-angled spleenwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It belongs to the family Saxifragaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves that are typically opposite or whorled in arrangement. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly along the ground, forming dense mats in moist, shaded environments. Chrysosplenium tetrandrum is often found in rocky or woodland areas, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions."
