    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. attenuata, commonly known as the European hazelnut or filbert, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and serrated leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces catkin-like male flowers and female flowers that develop into edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. The nuts are typically elongated and have a sweet, nutty flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible yield."
