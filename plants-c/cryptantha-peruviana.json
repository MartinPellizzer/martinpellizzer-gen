    "intro": "Cryptantha peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Cryptantha peruviana is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
