    "intro": "Carex tricarinata, commonly known as the three-ribbed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it produces three-angled, spike-like inflorescences. Carex tricarinata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
