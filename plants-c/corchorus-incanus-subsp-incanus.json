    "intro": "Corchorus incanus subsp. incanus, commonly known as the Indian mallow, is a herbaceous plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and showy, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is often found in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, riverbanks, and wetlands. Its seeds are encased in a fibrous, spiky capsule, which aids in seed dispersal. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and healing properties."
