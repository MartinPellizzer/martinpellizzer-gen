    "intro": "Cnicus mitis, commonly known as the sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit, with slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually gray-green, covered in fine hairs, and are arranged alternately along the stems. Cnicus mitis thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments."
