    "intro": "Cornus alternifolia, commonly known as gray dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves that are typically gray-green in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces white or pink flowers in late spring, which are clustered in umbels and attract pollinators. Its berries, which ripen in late summer, are red and edible for birds. Cornus alternifolia is valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
