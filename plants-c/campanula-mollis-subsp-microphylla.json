    "intro": "Campanula mollis subsp. microphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
