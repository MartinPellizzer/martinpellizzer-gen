    "intro": "Cylindrolepis, commonly known as the cylindrical fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araliaceae. It is characterized by its unique, cylindrical-shaped inflorescences, which are often mistaken for the spore-bearing structures of true ferns. The plants typically have compound leaves with a distinctive arrangement of leaflets. Cylindrolepis species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their attractive foliage and unique floral structures."
