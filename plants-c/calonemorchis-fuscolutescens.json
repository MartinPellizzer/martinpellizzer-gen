    "intro": "Calonemorchis fuscolutescens, commonly known as the brown-yellow orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has slender, wiry stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, pale pubescence. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
