It features elegant, arching fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length, with a feathery appearance. The plant produces bright yellow spore-bearing cones, which are distinctive and add to its ornamental value. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
