    "intro": "Clistranthus, commonly known as the \"Bottlebrush Plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive inflorescences, which resemble bottle brushes due to their dense clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plants are typically shrubs or subshrubs, with opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. They are native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands, and they thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. Clistranthus species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
