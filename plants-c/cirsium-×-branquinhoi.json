    "intro": "Cirsium \u00d7 branquinhoi, commonly known as the hybrid thistle, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. This hybrid species is the result of crossbreeding between different species of thistles, leading to a variety of morphological traits. It typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens despite its invasive potential in certain regions."
