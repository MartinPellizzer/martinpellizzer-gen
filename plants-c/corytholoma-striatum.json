    "intro": "Corytholoma striatum, commonly known as the streaked coral-tongue fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that often have a distinctive striped appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds, giving it its scientific name."
