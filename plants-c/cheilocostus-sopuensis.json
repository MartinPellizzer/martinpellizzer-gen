    "intro": "Cheilocostus sopuensis, commonly known as the Sopu ginger, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes other economically important plants like ginger and turmeric. The plant is characterized by its ornamental foliage, featuring broad, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive yellow-green coloration. Its flowering stems produce clusters of small, pale yellow flowers, which bloom during the wet season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and over-collection."
