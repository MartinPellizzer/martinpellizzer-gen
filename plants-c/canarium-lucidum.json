    "intro": "Canarium lucidum, commonly known as the white nut tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, smooth fruits that contain a single large seed. Its latex is milky and has been used traditionally for various purposes, including as a chewing gum. Canarium lucidum is also valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
