    "intro": "Cerastium ponticum, commonly known as the creeping snowseed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit with dense clusters of small, white flowers. The plant features slender, hairy stems and opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Cerastium ponticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
