It features large, palmately lobed leaves that are often green with a reddish or purple underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, humid climate. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
