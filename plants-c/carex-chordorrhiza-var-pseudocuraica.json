    "intro": "Carex chordorrhiza var. pseudocuraica, commonly known as the Curacao sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along water edges. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native region."
