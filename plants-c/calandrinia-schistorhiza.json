    "intro": "Calandrinia schistorhiza, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Portulacaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is adapted to hot, dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil conditions. Its flowers are typically pink or purple and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Calandrinia schistorhiza is often found in rocky soils and is a common sight in desert landscapes during the spring season."
