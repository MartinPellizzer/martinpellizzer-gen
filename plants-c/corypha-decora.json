    "intro": "Corypha decora, commonly known as the golden palm, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that are often a vibrant yellow or orange in color. The plant produces distinctive, spadix-like inflorescences that are surrounded by a showy spathe. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
