    "intro": "Cerasus laurocerasus parvifolia, commonly known as the cherry laurel, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It features dark green, glossy leaves that are elliptical and often have a slight serration along the edges. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, which are followed by edible, bright red berries. Its bark is smooth and dark grey, becoming fissured with age, and it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. The parvifolia variety is distinguished by its smaller, more delicate leaves compared to other Cerasus species."
