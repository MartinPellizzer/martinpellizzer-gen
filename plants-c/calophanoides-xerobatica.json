It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Due to its adaptability, it is often used in drought-resistant gardens."
