    "intro": "Clinostigmopsis harlandii, commonly known as the Harland's clinostigmopsis, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its delicate, violet-colored flowers and lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in cloud forests or high-altitude grasslands. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous minute seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Clinostigmopsis harlandii is considered a species of conservation concern."
