    "intro": "Coryanthes tefeensis, commonly known as the Tefe orchid, is a rare and striking tropical plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its large, intricate floral structures. The plant features a thick, fleshy rhizome and produces showy, often brightly colored flowers with a unique shape. Its flowers are typically green or yellow with red or orange markings, and they emit a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor to attract specific pollinators. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered a conservation concern."
