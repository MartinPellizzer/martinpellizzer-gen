    "intro": "Campanula praesignis var. breynina, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features showy, bell-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
