    "intro": "Cylicodaphne unita, commonly known as the slender sago palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnately compound leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by clustered berries. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates. However, it contains cycasin, a toxic compound, so care must be taken when handling it."
