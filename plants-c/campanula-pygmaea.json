    "intro": "Campanula pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate touch to alpine gardens. The plant has hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Campanula pygmaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
