    "intro": "Cousinia talassica, commonly known as the coastal cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along coastal areas. The plant features slender, upright stems and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or purple. Its leaves are linear and often covered with a fine layer of hairs to reduce water loss. Cousinia talassica is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, including high salinity and strong winds."
