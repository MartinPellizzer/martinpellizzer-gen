It is characterized by its unique calyx-like structure, which resembles a small pouch or slipper, giving it its genus name. The plant produces vibrant yellow and orange flowers with distinctive dark spots, which are particularly noticeable on the petals. Native to the Andes Mountains of South America, it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its striking floral display."
