    "intro": "Canarium fragile, commonly known as the brittle canarium, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing a single seed. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its hard, durable wood. However, it is considered endangered due to habitat loss and overexploitation."
