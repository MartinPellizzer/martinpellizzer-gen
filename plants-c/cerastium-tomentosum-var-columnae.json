    "intro": "Cerastium tomentosum var. columnae, commonly known as the woolly mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fluffy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its hairy foliage and compact growth habit make it a distinctive and ornamental species in its native habitat."
