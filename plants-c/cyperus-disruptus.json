    "intro": "Cyperus disruptus, commonly known as the shaggy flatsedge, is a member of the grass family Cyperaceae. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its slender, triangular stems and dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight hairy texture, and it produces distinctive, spike-like inflorescences. Cyperus disruptus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
