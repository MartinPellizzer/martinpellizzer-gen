    "intro": "Callitriche palustris var. verna, commonly known as spring water starwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to wetlands and slow-moving streams. It typically grows in shallow water, often in muddy or sandy substrates, and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers. The plant has whorled leaves that are often submerged, with floating leaves that are broader and more rounded. It blooms in early spring, producing white or pale blue flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and flies. This variety is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing aquatic habitats."
