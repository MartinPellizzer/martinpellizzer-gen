    "intro": "Coffea, commonly known as the coffee plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the Rubiaceae family. It consists of several species, with Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora being the most commercially important. The plant produces red berries containing seeds, which are the source of coffee beans. These beans are processed through drying, roasting, and grinding to make coffee. Botanically, Coffea is characterized by its evergreen shrub form and aromatic leaves."
