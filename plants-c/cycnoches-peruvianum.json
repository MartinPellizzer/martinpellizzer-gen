    "intro": "Cycnoches peruvianum, commonly known as the Peruvian moon cactus, is a rare and striking plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a hybrid between the rootstock of the Hylocereus species and the scion of the Cycnoches genus, resulting in its unique appearance. The plant features vibrant, night-blooming flowers in shades of white and pink, which emit a subtle fragrance. Its succulent leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its arid native environment. Despite its beauty, Cycnoches peruvianum is highly sensitive and requires specific care to thrive in cultivation."
