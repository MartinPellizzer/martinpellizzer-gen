    "intro": "Centaurea aspera subsp. aspera, commonly known as the rough centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and spiny, hairy stems. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, typically from June to August. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rough texture. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
