    "intro": "Cladocolea coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved daphne, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color and covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink during the spring. Its bark is rugged and fissured, contributing to its common name. Cladocolea coriacea is often grown in rock gardens or as a decorative hedge due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
