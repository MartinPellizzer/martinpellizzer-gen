    "intro": "Carpolyza spiralis, commonly known as the spiral fern, is a delicate and elegant plant native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its finely divided, spiral-shaped fronds that give it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests or humid gardens. Its leaves are often green with a slight sheen, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spore-bearing structures. Carpolyza spiralis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
