    "intro": "Cavea tanguensis, commonly known as the Tanguese cave plant, is a unique species native to the humid caves of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous roots that anchor it to the rocky walls of its subterranean habitat. The plant produces small, pale green leaves that are adapted to low-light conditions. Its flowers, which are rarely seen, are pale yellow and emit a faint scent to attract cave-dwelling insects. Due to its specialized environment, Cavea tanguensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
