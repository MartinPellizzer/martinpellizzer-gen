    "intro": "Conyza densiflora, commonly known as roughleaf fleabane, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It typically grows in open habitats such as fields, roadsides, and disturbed areas. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, with small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in composite heads. Its flowering period occurs during the summer months, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Conyza densiflora is often considered a weed but has ecological value as a food source for insects."
