It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant produces long, narrow leaves that give it its common name, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has a strong, spicy fragrance. The plant is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for gardens in tropical and subtropical regions."
