    "intro": "Casuarina quadrivalvis var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the coastal casuarina, is a medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical, needle-like foliage that resembles the appearance of a pine tree. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain edible seeds, which are a food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils, often forming dense stands along shorelines. This species is valued for its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion due to its deep root system."
