    "intro": "Cossonia platycarpa, commonly known as the African daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, facilitating wind dispersal."
