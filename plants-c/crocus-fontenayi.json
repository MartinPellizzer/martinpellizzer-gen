    "intro": "Crocus fontenayi, commonly known as the Fontenay crocus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its small, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
