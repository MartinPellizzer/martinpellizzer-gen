    "intro": "Cnicus cynaroides, commonly known as the common groundsel, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with hairy stems and lobed, serrated leaves. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the summer, followed by small, prickly fruits that disperse seeds by wind. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a weed in some regions."
