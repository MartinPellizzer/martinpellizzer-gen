It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and alternate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in umbels, which are often surrounded by leaf-like bracts. Cupania subrepanda is typically found in moist, shady habitats such as forests and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
