    "intro": "Coeloneurum, commonly known as the mountain helleborine, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their terrestrial growth habit and are typically found in temperate regions, especially in forested areas. The leaves are usually broad and leathery, with a prominent midrib, and the flowers are often greenish or brownish with a distinctive lip. Coeloneurum species are known for their ability to thrive in shaded environments, often growing on forest floors or in rocky soils. They play a role in their ecosystems by providing nectar for certain pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of their habitats."
