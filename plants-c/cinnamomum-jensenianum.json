    "intro": "Cinnamomum jensenianum, commonly known as Jensen's cinnamon, is a small evergreen tree native to the island of Borneo. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries containing a single seed. Its bark and leaves are used in traditional medicine and for their aromatic properties. However, it is relatively rare and faces threats from habitat loss and overharvesting."
