    "intro": "Craterispermum inquisitorium, commonly known as the \"questioning crater seed,\" is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants like buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. Its unique seed structure, which resembles a crater, gives it its scientific name. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
