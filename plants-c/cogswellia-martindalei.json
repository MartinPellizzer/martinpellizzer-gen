    "intro": "Cogswellia martindalei, commonly known as the Martindale's cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family. Native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in Argentina, it is characterized by its unique, spiny stems and vibrant, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, displaying a slow growth rate. Its flowers, which can be yellow, orange, or red, bloom in the spring and are an important feature for its identification. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
