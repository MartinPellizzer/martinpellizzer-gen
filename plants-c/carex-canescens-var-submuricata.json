    "intro": "Carex canescens var. submuricata, commonly known as the rough-haired sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and spike-like inflorescences. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of short, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its flowering stems produce small, greenish-brown flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. This species is often found in moist soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
