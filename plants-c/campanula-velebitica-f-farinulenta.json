    "intro": "Campanula velebitica f. farinulenta, commonly known as the farinulenta bellflower, is a rare and distinctive botanical variant native to the Velebit Mountains in Croatia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and bell-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh alpine conditions of its native habitat. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its rarity, it is considered vulnerable and requires protection to ensure its survival."
