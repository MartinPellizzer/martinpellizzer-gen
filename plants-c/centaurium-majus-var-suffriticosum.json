    "intro": "Centaurium majus var. suffriticosum, commonly known as the hairy centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are small, tubular, and usually pink or purple in color. It produces small, three-lobed seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across various regions. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
