    "intro": "Crinum linnaei, commonly known as the Linn\u00e6us crinum, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has strap-shaped, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette at the base. Crinum linnaei produces a tall, leafless stem that bears the flowers, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens in warmer climates."
