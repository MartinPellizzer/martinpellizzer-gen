It is characterized by its broad, wavy leaves that are typically green with a slight sheen. This variety thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as rivers and ponds, where it forms dense underwater vegetation.

It is also valued for its role in aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat for small fish and invertebrates."
