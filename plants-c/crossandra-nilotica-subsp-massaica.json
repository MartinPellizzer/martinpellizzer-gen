    "intro": "Crossandra nilotica subsp. massaica, commonly known as the Massaica flame flower, is a tropical shrub native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored, tubular flowers that range from red to orange, often with yellow throats. The plant has lance-shaped, glossy leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for cultivation in warm climates. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure."
