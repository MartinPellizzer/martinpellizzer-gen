    "intro": "Chimonanthus luteus, commonly known as the yellow lantern tree, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, before the leaves appear. The plant produces small, orange-red fruits that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. The yellow lantern tree is valued for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
