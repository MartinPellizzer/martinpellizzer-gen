    "intro": "Crucianella gilanica subsp. remota, commonly known as the Gilan endemic bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Caspian Sea region. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used for trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes and ponds. Its morphology includes thin, branching stems and tiny, scale-like leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
