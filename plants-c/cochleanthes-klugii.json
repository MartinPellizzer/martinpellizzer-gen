    "intro": "Cochleanthes klugii, commonly known as the Klug's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Africa, particularly found in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pendulous flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near streams or in forest understories. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Cochleanthes klugii is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
