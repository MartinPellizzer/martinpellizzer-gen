    "intro": "Clermontia grandiflora subsp. munroi, commonly known as the Kona mountainflower, is a rare endemic species native to the island of Hawaii. It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats on the slopes of Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
