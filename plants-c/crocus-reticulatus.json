    "intro": "Crocus reticulatus, commonly known as the Persian crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of purple, white, and yellow, typically blooming in late autumn or early winter. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is characterized by its reticulate (net-like) pattern on the underside of its petals. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Crocus reticulatus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its early flowering habit."
