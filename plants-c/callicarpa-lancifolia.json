    "intro": "Callicarpa lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by vibrant purple to red berries in the fall. These berries are not only ornamental but also attract birds and other wildlife. Callicarpa lancifolia is often cultivated for its aesthetic value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
