    "intro": "Centaurea maculosa subsp. corymbosa, commonly known as the spotted knapweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces bright yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and can form dense stands. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered an invasive species in many regions of North America."
