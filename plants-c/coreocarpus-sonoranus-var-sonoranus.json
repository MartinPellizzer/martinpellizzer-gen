    "intro": "Coreocarpus sonoranus var. sonoranus, commonly known as the Sonoran coreocarpus, is a shrub native to the Sonoran Desert region of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by distinctive, spiny fruits that contain the seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
