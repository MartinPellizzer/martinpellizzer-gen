    "intro": "Chastenaea glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular chastenaea, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically alternate and ovate, with a rough texture due to the presence of glandular structures. Chastenaea glandulosa is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and forest edges."
