    "intro": "Cymbidium tricolor, commonly known as the three-color orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a sympodial orchid with pseudobulbs that support its growth and storage of nutrients. The plant produces long, arching inflorescences with flowers in three distinct colors: white, yellow, and pink. Its leaves are strap-shaped, glossy, and arranged in a fan-like pattern. Cymbidium tricolor is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
