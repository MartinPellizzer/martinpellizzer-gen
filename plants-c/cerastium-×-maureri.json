    "intro": "Cerastium \u00d7 maureri, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Cerastium \u00d7 maureri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in gardens for its ability to form dense, carpet-like ground cover."
