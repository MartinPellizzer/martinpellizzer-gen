    "intro": "Cyrtosperma chamissonis, commonly known as the sand dune morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California. It is a herbaceous annual that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming in the early morning. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cyrtosperma chamissonis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing nectar for pollinators."
