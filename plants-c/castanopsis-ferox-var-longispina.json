    "intro": "Castanopsis ferox var. longispina, commonly known as the long-spined tanoak, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and dense, spiny fruit capsules. The plant belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts, and is known for its ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates. Its fruit, which contains one or two seeds, is an important food source for various wildlife species. The long, sharp spines on the fruit capsules are a distinctive botanical feature that aids in seed dispersal and protection against herbivores."
