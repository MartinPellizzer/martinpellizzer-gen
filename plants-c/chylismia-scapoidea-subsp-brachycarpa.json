    "intro": "Chylismia scapoidea subsp. brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-fruited chylismia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Iridaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its short, capsule-like fruits, which set it apart from other members of the species. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
