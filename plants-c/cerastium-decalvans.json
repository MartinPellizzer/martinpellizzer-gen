    "intro": "Cerastium decalvans, commonly known as the hairy mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clusters of white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. It has a mat-forming growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, cold climates. Cerastium decalvans is also known for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and low light levels."
