    "intro": "Coreopsis rigida, commonly known as rigid coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is a perennial herb that grows up to 3 feet tall, featuring sturdy, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces bright yellow to orange flowers in late spring to early summer, which are composed of ray florets surrounding a central disk. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native gardens and wildflower landscapes. Coreopsis rigida is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
