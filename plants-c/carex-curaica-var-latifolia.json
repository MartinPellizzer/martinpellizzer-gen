    "intro": "Carex curaica var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, consist of small, greenish flowers that are often wind-pollinated. The broad, flat leaves of this variety distinguish it from other sedges and contribute to its ornamental value in wetland gardens."
