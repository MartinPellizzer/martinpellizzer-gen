    "intro": "Carduus japonicus, commonly known as Japanese thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, covered in coarse, grayish-green foliage. The plant produces spiny, spherical flower heads that are typically purple or pink in color, resembling those of other thistle species. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a rough, hairy texture, which helps deter herbivores. Carduus japonicus is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry, open habitats."
