    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 leeanum var. aureum, commonly known as the golden cypripedium, is a hybrid orchid species native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its showy, golden-yellow flowers with a distinctive pouch-like lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. It has a long flowering period, usually from late spring to early summer. Due to its ornamental value and rarity in the wild, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
