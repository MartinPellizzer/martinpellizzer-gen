    "intro": "Cytisus demissus, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe. It features slender, woody stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are small, oval, and slightly hairy, with a distinctive scent. Cytisus demissus is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy plant in arid or coastal environments."
