    "intro": "Cactus pendulus, commonly known as the pendant cactus, is a species native to arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, spiny flowers that bloom in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The cactus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
