The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, which is common among sedges. Centrolepis inconspicua is notable for its ability to thrive in challenging habitats, making it an important species in ecological studies."
