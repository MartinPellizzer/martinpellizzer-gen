    "intro": "Chamaele decumbens var. micrantha, commonly known as the dwarf chamaeleon or micrantha chamaeleon, is a low-growing perennial plant native to certain regions of Africa. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
