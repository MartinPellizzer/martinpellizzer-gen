It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and hard wood, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
