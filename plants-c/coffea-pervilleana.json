    "intro": "Coffea pervilleana, commonly known as the Pervillea coffee plant, is a species native to certain regions of Africa. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries containing the seeds used for coffee. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a glossy surface and a distinct, aromatic scent. While not widely cultivated for commercial coffee production, it holds significance in local botanical studies and traditional uses."
