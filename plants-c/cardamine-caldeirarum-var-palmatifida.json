    "intro": "Cardamine caldeirarum var. palmatifida, commonly known as the broad-leaved water cress, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pinnately divided, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on elongated stems above the foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland edges. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor, making it a traditional ingredient in some regional cuisines."
