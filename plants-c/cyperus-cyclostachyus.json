It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters, with narrow, linear leaves that are typically slightly rolled. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, three-lobed flowers, which are usually greenish or reddish in color.
