    "intro": "Calophyllum hosei, commonly known as the Hawaiian calophyllum, is a tropical tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Calophyllaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, orange-red fruits. Calophyllum hosei is often found in coastal and lowland forests, thriving in humid, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
