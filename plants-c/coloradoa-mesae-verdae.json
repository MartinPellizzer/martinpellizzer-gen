    "intro": "Coloradoa mesae-verdae, commonly known as the Colorado Mountain Violet, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the western United States. It typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of small, violet-blue flowers. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of high elevations. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
