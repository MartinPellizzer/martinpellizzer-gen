    "intro": "Crepinella nigrescens, commonly known as black willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in wetlands. The plant has slender, zigzagging branches and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring. Crepinella nigrescens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
