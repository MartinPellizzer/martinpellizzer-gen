    "intro": "Cyphostemma cyphopetalum subsp. craterum, commonly known as the mountain cyphostemma, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It is often found growing in rocky outcrops and mountainous regions."
