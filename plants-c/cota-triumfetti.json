    "intro": "Cota triumfetti, commonly known as the triumphe or the false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads, which are dispersed by the wind. Cota triumfetti typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
