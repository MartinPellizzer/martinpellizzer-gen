    "intro": "Croton fuscus f. arenosa, commonly known as the sand croton, is a succulent shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its stems are often branched and can become woody with age, providing structural support in harsh environments. Croton fuscus f. arenosa is well-suited to dry conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
