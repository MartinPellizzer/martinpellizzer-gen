    "intro": "Chamaecytisus ciliatus, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, arching stems covered in fine, silky hairs, which give it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes along the stems. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and have a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
