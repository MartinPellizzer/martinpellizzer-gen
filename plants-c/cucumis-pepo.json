It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and is widely cultivated for its edible fruit. The plant is a herbaceous vine that produces cylindrical, spiny fruits that can vary in size and color. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. The fruit is typically harvested before it fully matures, when it is still tender and crisp."
