    "intro": "Crocus nerimaniae, commonly known as the Armenian crocus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Armenia. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, cup-shaped flowers with six petals. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cold winter dormancy period to flower properly. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
