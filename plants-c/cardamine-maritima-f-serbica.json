    "intro": "Cardamine maritima f. serbica, commonly known as the Serbica watercress, is a rare and specialized plant species adapted to coastal and saline environments. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in moist, sandy soils along shorelines and is often found in areas with high salinity. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
