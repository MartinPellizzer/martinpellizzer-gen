    "intro": "Casparia pes-caprae, commonly known as the beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy, saline environments, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in the early morning. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Casparia pes-caprae plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds."
