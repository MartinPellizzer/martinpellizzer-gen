    "intro": "Cereus inermis, commonly known as the naked candlestick cactus, is a species native to South America. It is a tall, spiny cactus that can grow up to 10 feet in height. The plant features a cylindrical stem with sharp, straight spines and produces yellow flowers at night. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil. Its botanical name reflects its lack of areoles, which are typically found on other cacti."
