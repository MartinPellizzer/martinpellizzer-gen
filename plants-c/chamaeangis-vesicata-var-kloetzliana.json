    "intro": "Chamaeangis vesicata var. kloetzliana, commonly known as the Klotzliana bladder fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Central America. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces distinctive, inflated spore cases, or sporangia, which are clustered in small, round structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical forests or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
