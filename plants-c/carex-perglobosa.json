    "intro": "Carex perglobosa, commonly known as the globular sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically wind-pollinated, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Carex perglobosa is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife. Its dense growth habit makes it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
