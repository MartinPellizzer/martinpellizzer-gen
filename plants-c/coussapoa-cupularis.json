    "intro": "Coussapoa cupularis, commonly known as the cup-shaped orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its unique cup-like structure formed by the fusion of its leaves, which helps retain moisture. Its flowers are small and white, often arranged in a loose cluster, and it blooms during the wet season. Due to habitat loss, it faces significant conservation challenges and is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN."
