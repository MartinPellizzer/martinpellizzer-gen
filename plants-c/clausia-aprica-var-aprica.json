It features upright, branching stems covered in dense, grayish-green foliage. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticulturists."
