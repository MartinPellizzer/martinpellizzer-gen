    "intro": "Callistemon rugulosus, commonly known as the rough bottlebrush, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive red or orange bottlebrush-like flowers that appear in clusters at the ends of its branches. The plant has rough, often hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for dry gardens. The rough bottlebrush is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract birds and insects."
