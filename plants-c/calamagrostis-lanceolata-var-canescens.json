    "intro": "Calamagrostis lanceolata var. canescens, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It features slender, upright stems that are densely covered with silver-gray hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces panicles of small, blue-green flowers in late summer, which add ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping and native plant gardens. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense clumps make it a valuable addition to ecological restoration projects."
