It is a natural hybrid between Centaurea cyanus (blue cornflower) and Centaurea jacea (woolly cornflower), resulting in a plant with distinctive blue to purple flowers. The species is characterized by its erect growth habit and showy composite flower heads that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and disturbed sites. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and used in floral arrangements."
