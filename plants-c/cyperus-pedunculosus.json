    "intro": "Cyperus pedunculosus, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that rise from a short, rhizomatous stem. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white to pale green flowers on slender, upright spikes, which give it a distinctive umbrella-like appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Cyperus pedunculosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
