    "intro": "Chirita neoforbesii, commonly known as the Neoforbes's chincherinchee, is a species of flowering plant in the family Gesneriaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouses."
