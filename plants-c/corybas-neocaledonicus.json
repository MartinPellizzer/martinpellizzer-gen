    "intro": "Corybas neocaledonicus, commonly known as the New Caledonian helmet orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the genus Corybas, which is characterized by its distinctive, often hood-like floral structure. The plant is notable for its small, intricate flowers that typically lack traditional petals, instead featuring a specialized lip or column. It thrives in the humid, shaded environments of New Caledonia's rainforests, where it forms symbiotic relationships with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
