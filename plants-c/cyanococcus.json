    "intro": "Cyanococcus, commonly known as the blue snowflake, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense clusters of small, blue or purple flowers. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. Cyanococcus species are often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value. The flowers typically bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
