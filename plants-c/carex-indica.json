    "intro": "Carex indica, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedgeland, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically wind-pollinated, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively. Carex indica thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and other aquatic habitats. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
