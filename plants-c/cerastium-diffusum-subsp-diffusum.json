    "intro": "Cerastium diffusum subsp. diffusum, commonly known as creeping mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
