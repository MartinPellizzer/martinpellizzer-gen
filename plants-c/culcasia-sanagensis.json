It is characterized by its arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically broad and floating on the water surface. The plant has long, slender stems that often trail beneath the water, supporting the foliage. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, preferring nutrient-rich soils. Culcasia sanagensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in ponds and water gardens."
