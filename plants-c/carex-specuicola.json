    "intro": "Carex specuicola, commonly known as the cave sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in dense spikes. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in its habitat. Carex specuicola is often found in limestone-rich soils and is adapted to low-light conditions."
