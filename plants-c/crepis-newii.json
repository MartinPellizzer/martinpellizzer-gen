    "intro": "Crepis newii, commonly known as the Newii bentgrass, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Tien Shan and Pamir Mountains. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its small, yellow flowers are typically arranged in compact clusters, and it produces achene fruits with pappus for wind dispersal. Crepis newii is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, dry environments."
