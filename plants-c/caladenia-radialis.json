    "intro": "Caladenia radialis, commonly known as the pink-streaked spider-orchid, is an orchid species native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in heathlands and open forests, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features a single, erect stem with a single, showy pink or purple flower that has a distinctive spider-like appearance. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it blooms during the spring and early summer. The orchid is pollinated primarily by thynnid wasps, which are attracted to its nectar-rich flowers."
