    "intro": "Chenopodium aristatum var. inerme, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is a low-growing annual or biennial plant with hairy, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its succulent stems and leaves store water, making it well-adapted to harsh, drought-prone habitats. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along roadsides and disturbed areas."
