    "intro": "Chionanthus obovatus, commonly known as the fringetree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring, often in clusters along the branches. The leaves are opposite, ovate to obovate in shape, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
