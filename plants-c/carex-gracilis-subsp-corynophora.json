    "intro": "Carex gracilis subsp. corynophora, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
