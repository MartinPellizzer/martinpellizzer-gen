    "intro": "Cochlearia tridactylites, commonly known as the three-fingered rockcress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and North America. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves that are lobed and resemble fingers. It produces small, white or purple flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees. Cochlearia tridactylites thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or coastal habitats."
