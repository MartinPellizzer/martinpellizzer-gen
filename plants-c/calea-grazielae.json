    "intro": "Calea grazielae, commonly known as the \"Mexican flame flower,\" is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, tubular yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects, particularly bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions. Calea grazielae is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
