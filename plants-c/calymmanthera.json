    "intro": "Calymmanthera, commonly known as the sandalwood tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its scent and durability. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in dry or sandy soils. Calymmanthera species are known for their compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. Due to overharvesting, many species are now threatened with extinction."
