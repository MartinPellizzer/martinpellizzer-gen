    "intro": "Cyathea grenadensis, commonly known as the Grenada tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the Caribbean, particularly Grenada and other nearby islands. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizome system supports its growth, and it plays a role in the ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability. Cyathea grenadensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
