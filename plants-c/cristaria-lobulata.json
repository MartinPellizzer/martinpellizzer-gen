    "intro": "Cristaria lobulata, commonly known as the common bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats across Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic invertebrates. The plant typically grows in shallow water and has delicate, branched stems covered in tiny, hair-like structures. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, often appearing in clusters. Despite its carnivorous nature, it plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling insect populations."
