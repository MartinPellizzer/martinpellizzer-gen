    "intro": "Coryphadenia plerocarpa, commonly known as the broadleaf coryphadenia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, palmate leaves and vibrant, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along riverbanks and in dense forests. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Coryphadenia plerocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential ecological roles in its native habitats."
