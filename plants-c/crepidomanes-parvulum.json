    "intro": "Crepidomanes parvulum, commonly known as the small sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and rocky habitats. It features small, fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. It has a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in well-drained soils. Crepidomanes parvulum is often found in coastal dunes, gravelly slopes, and disturbed areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
