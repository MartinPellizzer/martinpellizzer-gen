    "intro": "Cochlidium, commonly known as the common snail, is a genus of terrestrial gastropod mollusks belonging to the family Helicidae. These snails are characterized by their spiral-shaped shells and are often found in moist, temperate environments. They play an important role in ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling through their feeding habits. Cochlidium species are typically herbivorous, feeding on a variety of plants and organic matter. Their presence is often an indicator of a healthy, undisturbed habitat."
