It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant features palmate leaves with three to five leaflets and produces yellow or orange flowers that attract pollinators. Its seeds are encased in elongated, slender pods, which are often used in traditional medicine. Crotalaria oxyptera is also known for its potential toxicity to livestock due to the presence of certain alkaloids."
