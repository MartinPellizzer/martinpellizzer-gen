    "intro": "Cousinia refracta, commonly known as the rock couch grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It features wiry, creeping stems that form dense mats, often growing close to the ground. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in a fine layer of white hair. Its small, pale blue or purple flowers appear in clusters during the summer months. Cousinia refracta is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
