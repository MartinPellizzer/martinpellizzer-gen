    "intro": "Carex rupestris f. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf rock sedge, is a low-growing, clump-forming perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and densely packed, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking to add texture and interest to dry, rocky settings."
