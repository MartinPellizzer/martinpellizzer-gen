    "intro": "Campylia coronopifolia, commonly known as the crownleaf or crown-leaf plant, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are divided into five to seven lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces showy, yellow flowers with a red calyx that resembles a crown, hence its common name. Campylia coronopifolia is often found in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in open woods."
