    "intro": "Campanula scheuchzeri f. humilior, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a rare and low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces delicate blue or violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas where it blooms in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
