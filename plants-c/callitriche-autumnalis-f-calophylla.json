    "intro": "Callitriche autumnalis f. calophylla, commonly known as the autumn water starwort, is a semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant features small, star-shaped leaves that are usually floating or partially submerged. Its flowers are tiny, white or pale blue, and appear in clusters near the water's surface. This variety is characterized by its broader, more robust leaves compared to the typical form of Callitriche autumnalis."
