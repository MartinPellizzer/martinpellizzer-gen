    "intro": "Carex elatior, commonly known as the tall sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and cylindrical, spike-like flower clusters. Native to wet or moist environments, it thrives in marshy areas and along stream banks. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-lobed, triangular seeds. Carex elatior is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
