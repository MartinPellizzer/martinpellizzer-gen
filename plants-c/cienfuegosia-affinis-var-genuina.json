It is characterized by its vibrant red to orange tubular flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has opposite, simple, elliptic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. The flowers attract hummingbirds and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to pollinator gardens."
