    "intro": "Cornopteris parvisora, commonly known as the small-veined wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinct, narrow shape and a pale, sometimes rusty-colored margin. Cornopteris parvisora thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices."
