    "intro": "Chrysopogon pauciflorus, commonly known as the few-flowered grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy surface, while its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like structures. Chrysopogon pauciflorus is of interest in ecological studies due to its adaptability to arid environments."
