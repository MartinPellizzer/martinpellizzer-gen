    "intro": "Cheirinia erysimoides, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in dry conditions."
