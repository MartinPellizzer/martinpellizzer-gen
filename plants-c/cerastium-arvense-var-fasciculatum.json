It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in cultivated areas. Its botanical structure is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and its ability to form dense mats."
