It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are often finely divided. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
