    "intro": "Coleus zombensis, commonly known as the zombie plant, is a unique member of the Lamiaceae family. It is native to the dense, humid rainforests of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its striking, often vividly colored foliage, which can range from deep purples to bright reds and oranges. Its leaves are velvety to the touch and emit a mild, minty scent when crushed. Although not a true carnivorous plant, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
