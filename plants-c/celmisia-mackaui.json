    "intro": "Celmisia mackaui, commonly known as the Mackau's celmisia, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, often hairy leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine regions, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its foliage is usually dense and can form a low, mat-like growth, which helps it survive in harsh mountain conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
