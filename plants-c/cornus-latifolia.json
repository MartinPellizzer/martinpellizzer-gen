    "intro": "Cornus latifolia, commonly known as mountain ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its showy white or pinkish flowers that appear in clusters, typically in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly serrated margin. Cornus latifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in mountainous regions and forest edges."
