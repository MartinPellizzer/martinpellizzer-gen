    "intro": "Cynosurus elegans var. chalybaeus, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of narrow, spike-like clusters of small, pale-green to brownish flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting insect life and stabilizing soil."
