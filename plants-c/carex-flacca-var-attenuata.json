It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, which are usually green or brown in color. This variety is notable for its graceful, drooping appearance and its ability to thrive in poorly drained soils."
