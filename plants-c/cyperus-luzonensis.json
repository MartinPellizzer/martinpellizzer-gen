    "intro": "Cyperus luzonensis, commonly known as the Luzon flatsedge, is a perennial herb native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters at the base of the stems. It thrives in wetland habitats, including marshes and roadside ditches, and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Cyperus luzonensis is adapted to moist environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
