    "intro": "Conopodium bunioides var. aranii, commonly known as the purple false spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant features upright stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy and have a slightly serrated margin. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is notable for its latex-like sap, which can be toxic if ingested."
