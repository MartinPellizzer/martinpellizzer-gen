    "intro": "Chenopodium macrospermum var. farinosum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silky pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and its seeds are enclosed in inflated, three-lobed capsules. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. The species is known for its rapid growth and ability to produce a large number of seeds, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions."
