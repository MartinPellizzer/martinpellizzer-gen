    "intro": "Cymodocea acaulis, commonly known as the stoloniferous shoal grass, is a marine flowering plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its submerged, grass-like appearance and forms dense mats on the seafloor. The plant lacks true stems and has a rhizomatous growth system that allows it to spread across sandy or muddy substrates. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, adapted for survival in shallow coastal waters. Cymodocea acaulis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms."
