    "intro": "Cleome linearis, commonly known as the spider flower, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, linear leaves and produces striking, spindly flower clusters that resemble spider legs, hence its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are usually pink to purple and bloom from late summer into early fall. Cleome linearis is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
