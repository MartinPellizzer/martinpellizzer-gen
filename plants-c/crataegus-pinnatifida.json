    "intro": "Crataegus pinnatifida, commonly known as the Chinese hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 11 leaflets, and its showy white or pink flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are edible but have a tart flavor. Crataegus pinnatifida is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and floral display. It is also used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
