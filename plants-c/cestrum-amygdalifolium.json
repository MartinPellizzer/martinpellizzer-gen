    "intro": "Cestrum amygdalifolium, commonly known as the sweet scent plant or fragrant cestrum, is a shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and pleasant scent. Cestrum amygdalifolium thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun."
