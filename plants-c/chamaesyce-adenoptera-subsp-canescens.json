    "intro": "Chamaesyce adenoptera subsp. canescens, commonly known as the hairy sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features small, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its succulent leaves and adaptive growth form make it well-suited for survival in harsh, drought-prone conditions."
