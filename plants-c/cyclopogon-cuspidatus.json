    "intro": "Cyclopogon cuspidatus, commonly known as the sharp-pointed cyclopogon, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is a terrestrial bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup at the center. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with vibrant colors that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
