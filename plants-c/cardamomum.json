    "intro": "Cardamomum, commonly known as cardamom, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is cultivated for its aromatic, spindle-shaped seeds. The plant produces clusters of bright green, finger-like leaves and has a rhizomatous root system. Its seeds, often referred to as \"cardamom pods,\" are harvested when mature and dried for use in cooking and traditional medicine. Cardamomum thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
