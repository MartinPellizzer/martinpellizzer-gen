    "intro": "Castanocarpus, commonly known as the silky oak, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Proteaceae. It is native to Australia and includes several species, such as Castanocarpus spathulatus, which is widely cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and showy, pink or red flowers that appear in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the tree is often used in landscaping due to its fast growth and ability to tolerate various soil conditions. Castanocarpus species are also valued for their timber, which is lightweight and durable."
