    "intro": "Cotoneaster acutifolius f. glabricalyx, commonly known as the smooth-leaved cotoneaster, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness in colder climates. The variety 'glabricalyx' is distinguished by its lack of hairy surfaces, giving it a sleek appearance compared to other cotoneaster species."
