It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, grass-like leaves. This subspecies is distinguished by its reduced leaf pubescence compared to the typical form, giving it a smoother texture. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments, often in meadows or along stream banks. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
