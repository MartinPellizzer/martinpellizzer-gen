    "intro": "Camaridium rugosum, commonly known as the roughleaf sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Camaridium rugosum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
