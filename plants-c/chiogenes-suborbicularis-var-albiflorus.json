It is characterized by its compact, sprawling growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically tubular with five lobes, adapted for pollination by insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species."
