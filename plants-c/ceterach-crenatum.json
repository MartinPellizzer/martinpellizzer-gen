    "intro": "Ceterach crenatum, commonly known as the rock wallaby grass, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often found in coastal dunes and cliffs. The plant produces small, white or cream-colored flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Ceterach crenatum is well adapted to harsh coastal environments and is an important component of coastal vegetation."
