    "intro": "Calanthe gracilis var. sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran slender calanthe, is a rare and elegant orchid native to the mountainous regions of Sumatra. It is characterized by its slender, upright pseudobulbs and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, often with a contrasting lip. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
