It is characterized by its dense, feather-like foliage that forms compact, upright clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stems. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically followed by fluffy, seed-bearing structures. Callipteris ulugurica is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat."
