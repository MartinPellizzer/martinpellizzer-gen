    "intro": "Calycadenia truncata var. scabrella, commonly known as the roughleaf desert-honeysuckle, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough, scabrous texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange, blooming in spring and early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. The species is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
