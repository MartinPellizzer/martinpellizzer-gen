    "intro": "Cheilanthes subrufa, commonly known as the red-veined rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and rocky environments in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The fronds are typically divided into narrow segments with a distinctive reddish vein pattern, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Cheilanthes subrufa is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy and resilient plant in harsh environments."
