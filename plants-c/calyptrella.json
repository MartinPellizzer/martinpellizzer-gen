    "intro": "Calyptrella, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plants are characterized by their compact growth habit and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in spring. Calyptrella species typically have hairy leaves and produce small, hard seeds that are adapted for dispersal by wind. These plants are often used in rock gardens due to their ornamental value and drought tolerance."
