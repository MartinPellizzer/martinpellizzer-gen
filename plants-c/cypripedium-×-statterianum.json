    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 statterianum, commonly known as the Statter's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a pseudobulb structure and produces long, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts, though it is also threatened by habitat loss and over-collection."
