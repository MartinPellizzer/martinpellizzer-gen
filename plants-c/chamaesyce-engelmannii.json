    "intro": "Chamaesyce engelmannii, commonly known as Engelmann's sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual or biennial species that typically forms a dense mat of slender, branching stems. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its leaves are linear and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Chamaesyce engelmannii is adapted to sandy and rocky soils, making it a common sight in desert and semi-desert habitats."
