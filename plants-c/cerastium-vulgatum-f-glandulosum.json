    "intro": "Cerastium vulgatum f. glandulosum, commonly known as the sticky chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving them a slightly sticky texture. The plant produces clusters of white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its hairy leaves and clustered flowers make it easily distinguishable from other members of the Caryophyllaceae family."
