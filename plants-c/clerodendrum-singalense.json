    "intro": "Clerodendrum singalense, commonly known as the Indian flame bush, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green with a slightly pubescent surface. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to red, depending on the stage of bloom. These flowers are followed by distinctive, fleshy, red or orange berries that contain several seeds. Clerodendrum singalense is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
