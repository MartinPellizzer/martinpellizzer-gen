    "intro": "Cyclosorus parasiticus var. cylindrothrix, commonly known as the cylindrical parasitic liverwort, is a member of the family Pottiaceae. It is a non-photosynthetic, epiphytic liverwort that relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant exhibits a thalloid structure with a flat, ribbon-like body covered in small, rounded papillae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on the bark of trees or rocks. Due to its parasitic nature, it lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients directly through its thallus."
