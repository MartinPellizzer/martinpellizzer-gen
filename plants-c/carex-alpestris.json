    "intro": "Carex alpestris, commonly known as alpine sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate and alpine regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and mountainous areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which helps prevent soil erosion. Carex alpestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
