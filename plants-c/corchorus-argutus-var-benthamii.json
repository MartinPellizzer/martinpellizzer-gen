It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its fibrous roots have been traditionally used for their mucilage, which has medicinal properties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks."
