    "intro": "Callistemon pendulus var. rigidus, commonly known as the rigid bottlebrush, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its striking, bright red cylindrical flowers that resemble bottle brushes, which appear in winter and spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically grey-green in color and are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. The rigid form of this variety gives it a more upright and structured appearance compared to other bottlebrush species."
