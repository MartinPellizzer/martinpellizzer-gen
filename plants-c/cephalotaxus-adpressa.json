    "intro": "Cephalotaxus adpressa, commonly known as the flatleaf yew, is a rare and ancient coniferous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive, narrow, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a flat, compact manner. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
