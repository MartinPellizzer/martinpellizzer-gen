    "intro": "Ctenophyllum, commonly known as the feather moss, is a genus of mosses belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plants typically form dense, low-growing mats, often found in forest floors or on rocky substrates. Ctenophyllum species have a distinctive structure with leaf-like structures that are often recurved and have a single costa. These mosses play an important role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in their ecosystems."
