    "intro": "Calamagrostis hyperborea var. elongata, commonly known as the Arctic feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and alpine regions of northern Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in open, rocky or sandy habitats, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps. Its flowering stems bear panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are usually pale green to brown in color. This variety is adapted to cold climates and is often found in tundra and subarctic environments."
