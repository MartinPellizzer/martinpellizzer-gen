    "intro": "Cardamine pratensis var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered water crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wet meadows and stream sides in temperate regions. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic environments. The plant produces showy, white or pale yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals, typically arranged in a cluster at the tip of the stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize moist habitats effectively. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
