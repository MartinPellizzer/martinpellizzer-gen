    "intro": "Corydalis pauciflora subsp. sajanensis, commonly known as the Sajanensis Corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has slender, herbaceous stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
