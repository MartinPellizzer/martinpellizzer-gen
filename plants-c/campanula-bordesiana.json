    "intro": "Campanula bordesiana, commonly known as the Balkan bellflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor environments. Campanula bordesiana is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of mountainous ecosystems."
