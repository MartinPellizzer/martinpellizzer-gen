    "intro": "Corytholoma warmingii, commonly known as the Chinese horned mushroom, is a species of bracket fungus characterized by its distinctive, horn-like cap and thick, woody stipe. It is native to China and grows on decaying hardwoods, typically in humid forest environments. The fruiting bodies are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with a rough, uneven surface. This mushroom is prized in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits. However, it is important to note that it can be toxic if consumed in large quantities."
