It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which are typically greenish or reddish in color. It thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas or along waterways. Its botanical characteristics make it both an ornamental plant and a potential weed in aquatic environments."
