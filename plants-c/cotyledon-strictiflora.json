    "intro": "Cotyledon strictiflora, commonly known as the upright cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with red or purple edges, providing a striking visual appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
