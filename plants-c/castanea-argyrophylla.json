    "intro": "Castanea argyrophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The tree produces small, spiny burrs that enclose its edible nuts. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Castanea argyrophylla is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in chaparral and woodland ecosystems."
