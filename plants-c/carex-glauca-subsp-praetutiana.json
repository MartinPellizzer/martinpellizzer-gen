    "intro": "Carex glauca subsp. praetutiana, commonly known as the blue-green sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of North America. It typically grows in wet to mesic habitats such as marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often a striking blue-green color, especially when young. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
