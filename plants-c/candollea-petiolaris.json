It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that arise from a creeping rhizome. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that give it a feathery appearance. Candollea petiolaris thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth."
