    "intro": "Carex macrocephala var. longibracteata, commonly known as the broad-headed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to brown in color, with the inflorescences often being longer than the leaves. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, and is often used in wetland restoration projects. The variety longibracteata is distinguished by its elongated bracts that enclose the flower clusters, giving it a unique appearance."
