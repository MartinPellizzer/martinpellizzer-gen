    "intro": "Crataegus punctata var. rubra, commonly known as the red-fruited hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to elliptic leaves, and clusters of white flowers that appear in spring. The fruit, which is a small, red-pink berry, ripens in the fall and is an important food source for birds and wildlife. This variety is distinguished by its vibrant red berries, which contrast with the green foliage, making it a visually striking plant in the landscape. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and open areas."
