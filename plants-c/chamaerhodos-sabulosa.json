    "intro": "Chamaerhodos sabulosa, commonly known as sand chamaerhodos, is a flowering plant native to the United States, particularly found in sandy and gravelly soils. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and dunes, adapting well to arid and coastal environments. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against harsh weather conditions. Chamaerhodos sabulosa is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
