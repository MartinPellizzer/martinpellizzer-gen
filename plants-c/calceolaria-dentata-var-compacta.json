    "intro": "Calceolaria dentata var. compacta, commonly known as the compact toothed slipper orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant produces small, hairy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture in its high-altitude habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky soils at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses around the world."
