    "intro": "Castelaria calcicola, commonly known as the limestone castelaria, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family. This species is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves adapted to withstand drought conditions. Castelaria calcicola typically grows in well-drained soils, often found on rocky or limestone substrates. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually clustered in dense inflorescences, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing sandy or rocky soils."
