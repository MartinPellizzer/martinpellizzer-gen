    "intro": "Cynodon plectostachyus var. ruspolianus, commonly known as the African buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, dense sod-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in summer, which are clustered in spikelets. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for grazing and erosion control. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
