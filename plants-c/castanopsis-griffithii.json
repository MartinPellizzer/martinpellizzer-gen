    "intro": "Castanopsis griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's talaud, is a species of evergreen tree native to the western Ghats of India. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its hard, durable wood. The plant produces small, cup-shaped fruits that contain one or two seeds, typical of the genus Castanopsis. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical forest ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
