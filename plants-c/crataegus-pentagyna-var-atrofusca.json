    "intro": "Crataegus pentagyna var. atrofusca, commonly known as the blackthorn or sloe, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are covered in a waxy coating. The plant has thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. The flowers are white and appear in early spring, followed by the development of its distinctive berries later in the year."
