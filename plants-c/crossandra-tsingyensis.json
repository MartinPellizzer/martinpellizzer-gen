    "intro": "Crossandra tsingyensis, commonly known as the Tsingy Mountains Crossandra, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone habitats, reflecting its adaptation to the unique geological conditions of its native region. Its foliage consists of lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, Crossandra tsingyensis is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
