It is characterized by its small, thorny stems and oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in spring, followed by red or orange berries in the autumn. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt-laden winds, making it a hardy species found in maritime environments. Its ecological importance includes providing food for birds and supporting local biodiversity in coastal habitats."
