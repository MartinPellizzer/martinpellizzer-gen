    "intro": "Cystopteris crenata, commonly known as the serrated water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically serrated along the edges. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are often submerged, and the fronds can spread out to form a dense mat on the water's surface. Cystopteris crenata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
