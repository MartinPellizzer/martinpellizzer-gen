    "intro": "Chlidanthus cumingii, commonly known as the Cuming's bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
