It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a vibrant touch to gardens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
