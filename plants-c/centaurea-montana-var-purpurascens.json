    "intro": "Centaurea montana var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple mountain cornflower, is a variant of the common centaurea that exhibits distinctive purple flower heads. It is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe, characterized by its tall, spindly stems and vibrant purple-blue florets. The plant produces small, bract-like leaves and has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in well-drained soils. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance once established."
