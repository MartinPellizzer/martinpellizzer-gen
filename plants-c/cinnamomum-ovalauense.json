    "intro": "Cinnamomum ovalauense, commonly known as the Vanuatu cinnamon tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the island of Vanuatu in the South Pacific. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like cinnamon and laurel. The plant is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by dark purple berries. Its bark and leaves are used in traditional medicine and for flavoring, though it is less commercially significant than other cinnamon species. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests."
