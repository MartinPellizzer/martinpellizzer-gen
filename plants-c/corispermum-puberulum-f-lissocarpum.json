    "intro": "Corispermum puberulum f. lissocarpum, commonly known as the smooth-fruited sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Chenopodiaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its fruits are smooth, spherical capsules. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or coastal environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions with minimal water availability."
