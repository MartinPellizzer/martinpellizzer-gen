    "intro": "Crepis sieberi, commonly known as Sieber's mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Crepis sieberi is a perennial species that produces seeds through a process called wind pollination."
