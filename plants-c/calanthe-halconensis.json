    "intro": "Calanthe halconensis, commonly known as the Halconensis Calanthe, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and its roots are often covered in a dense, white mycorrhizal sheath. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
