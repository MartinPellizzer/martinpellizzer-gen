The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by oval, woody fruits containing seeds. Cupania glabra is known for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats. It is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
