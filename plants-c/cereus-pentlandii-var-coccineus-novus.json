    "intro": "Cereus pentlandii var. coccineus-novus, commonly known as the Crimson Night Blooming Cereus, is a succulent cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stem and clusters of white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant has sharp, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few hours, and are pollinated by nocturnal insects. The plant is popular in horticulture for its striking appearance and unique blooming habit."
