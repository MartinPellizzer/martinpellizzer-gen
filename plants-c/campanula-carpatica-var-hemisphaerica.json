    "intro": "Campanula carpatica var. hemisphaerica, commonly known as the Globe bellflower, is a compact, mat-forming perennial that produces clusters of bell-shaped, sky-blue to white flowers. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features silver-gray, hairy leaves that are slightly rounded and often form a dense, low-growing mound. It blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
