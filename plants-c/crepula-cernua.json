    "intro": "Crepula cernua, commonly known as the hanging bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers that hang downward, often in clusters, and are typically blue or violet in color. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Crepula cernua is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it adapts to cold and harsh conditions."
