    "intro": "Cattleya kerrii, commonly known as the Kerri's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are broad and sword-shaped, often arranged in a fan-like pattern. Cattleya kerrii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
