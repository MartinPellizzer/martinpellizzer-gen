    "intro": "Cordula insignis, commonly known as the African sandthorn, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Cordula insignis is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
