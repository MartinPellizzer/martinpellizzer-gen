    "intro": "Ceterach latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf ceterach, is a perennial seagrass found in coastal regions of the southern hemisphere. It thrives in shallow, sandy or muddy substrates in intertidal zones, often forming dense underwater meadows. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are typically broad at the base, giving it a distinctive appearance. It plays an important role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for marine life. Its reproductive structures are specialized, with flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer."
