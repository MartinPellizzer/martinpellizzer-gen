It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
