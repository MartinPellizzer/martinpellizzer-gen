    "intro": "Cocculus dichrous, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, warty, and often twisted stems that resemble a backbone, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by yellowish fruits that split open to reveal bright red seeds. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture. Cocculus dichrous is often used in traditional medicine and is also cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique appearance."
