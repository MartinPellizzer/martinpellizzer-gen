    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 clinkaberryanum, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium guttatum. It is a terrestrial orchid with a tall, erect stem that bears a single, showy, pouch-shaped flower. The flower typically has a deep pink or red lip with contrasting yellow markings, and the sepals and petals are usually white or pale pink. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and meadows, and requires well-drained, acidic soil. This hybrid is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
