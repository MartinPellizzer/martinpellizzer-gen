    "intro": "Citrus hindsii, commonly known as the Hinds' lemon, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean. It produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are typically harvested when they are fully mature. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its native tropical environment. Its flowers are fragrant and white, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. While not widely cultivated for commercial use, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
