    "intro": "Calonemorchis excelsa, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater bodies. The plant's flowers are showy, typically white or pink, and bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud and absorbing nutrients from the water. Calonemorchis excelsa plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing habitat for aquatic life and contributing to water quality regulation."
