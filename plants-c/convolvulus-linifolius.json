    "intro": "Convolvulus linifolius, commonly known as the silky blue morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in the early morning. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its rapid growth and ability to climb or trail make it both ornamental and useful for erosion control."
