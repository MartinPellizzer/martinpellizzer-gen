    "intro": "Cardamine taquetii, commonly known as the Taquet's watercress, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly in suitable habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
