    "intro": "Coccoloba zebra, commonly known as the zebra hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that feature a distinctive zebra-like pattern of light and dark green. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to thrive in humid, sunny environments. Coccoloba zebra is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant foliage and long-lasting blooms."
