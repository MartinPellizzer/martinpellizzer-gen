    "intro": "Carex angustior var. gracilenta, commonly known as narrowleaf bulrush, is a species of sedge native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Its dense growth helps stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
