    "intro": "Crataegus mollis var. mollis, commonly known as the Downy Hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and clusters of white to pinkish flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but generally unpalatable to humans. Its leaves are ovate with a serrated margin and turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The Downy Hawthorn is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
