    "intro": "Cephalotaxus drupacea var. pedunculata, commonly known as the Chinese yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to China. It features a compact, rounded shape with dense foliage composed of scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for ornamental gardening. Its ornamental value lies in its attractive form and seasonal color changes, though care must be taken due to its toxic properties."
