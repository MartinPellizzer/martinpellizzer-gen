    "intro": "Calyptranthes tobagensis, commonly known as the Toba calyptranthes, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Tobago. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. It produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
