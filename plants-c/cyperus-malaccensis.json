    "intro": "Cyperus malaccensis, commonly known as the Malacca flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and tidal flats, and has rhizomatous roots that help it spread vegetatively. Its leaves are linear and often have a distinct midrib, while the inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a cylindrical cluster. Cyperus malaccensis is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
