    "intro": "Convolvulus suffultus, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically opening in the morning. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and twining. Convolvulus suffultus is adapted to extreme drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in low-water environments."
