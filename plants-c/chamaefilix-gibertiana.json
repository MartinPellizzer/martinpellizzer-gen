    "intro": "Chamaefilix gibertiana, commonly known as the Gibraltar rockrose, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the rocky habitats of the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its gray-green foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and habitat specificity, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
