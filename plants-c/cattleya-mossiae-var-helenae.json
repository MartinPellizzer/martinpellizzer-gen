    "intro": "Cattleya mossiae var. helenae, commonly known as Helen's Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid prized for its vibrant, fragrant flowers. It features large, showy blooms with a mix of pink and white petals, often accented with a deep red lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in warm, humid environments. It requires bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media to thrive. Its botanical name reflects its origin from a cross between Cattleya mossiae and Cattleya helenae, highlighting its hybrid nature."
