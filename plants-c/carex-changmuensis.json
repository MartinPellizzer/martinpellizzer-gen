    "intro": "Carex changmuensis, commonly known as the Changmu sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, rushes, and other grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, three-lobed flowers. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Carex changmuensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in its native environment."
