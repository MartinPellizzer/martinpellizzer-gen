    "intro": "Cumulopuntia pentlandii, commonly known as the Pentland cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a compact, mound-like structure. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and adapting it to harsh desert conditions. The cactus is also known for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems, allowing it to survive in low-rainfall environments."
