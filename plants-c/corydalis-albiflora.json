    "intro": "Corydalis albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, often nodding flowers that are predominantly white or pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has slender, hairy stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers bloom in early spring, producing a cluster of small, spurred blossoms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Corydalis albiflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
