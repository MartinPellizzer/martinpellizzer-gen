    "intro": "Cotyledon hirtifolia, commonly known as the woolly cotyledon, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically during the spring or early summer. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements. Cotyledon hirtifolia thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers."
