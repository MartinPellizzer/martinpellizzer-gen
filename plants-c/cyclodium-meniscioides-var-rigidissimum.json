The plant has a compact growth habit with rigid, often branching stems that are covered in fine, woolly hairs. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often recurved, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Cyclodium meniscioides var. rigidissimum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with low rainfall and high temperatures."
