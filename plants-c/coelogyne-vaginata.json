    "intro": "Coelogyne vaginata, commonly known as the orchid with a pouch, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a mix of white and pink hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often forming a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Coelogyne vaginata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
