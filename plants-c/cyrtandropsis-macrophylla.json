    "intro": "Cyrtandropsis macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved cycad, is a unique species native to Madagascar. It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its large, pinnate leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk and produces cones rather than flowers, typical of cycads. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental foliage due to their striking appearance."
