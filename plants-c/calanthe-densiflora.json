    "intro": "Calanthe densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered calanthe, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences of white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically broad and elliptical, arranged in a basal rosette. Calanthe densiflora thrives in cool, shaded environments and requires well-drained, humus-rich soil for optimal growth."
