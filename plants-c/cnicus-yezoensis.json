    "intro": "Cnicus yezoensis, commonly known as Yezo thistle, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, spiny leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs and have a distinctive, prickly texture. The flowers, which appear in late summer, are yellow and are followed by spherical, bristly seed heads that aid in wind dispersal."
