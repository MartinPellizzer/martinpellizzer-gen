    "intro": "Cicerbita laevigata, commonly known as the smooth bittercress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides and in meadows. The plant has small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are alternate, smooth, and often lobed. Its fruit is a dry, segmented pod that splits open to release tiny seeds. The species is known for its slightly bitter taste, which is characteristic of many members of the Brassicaceae family."
