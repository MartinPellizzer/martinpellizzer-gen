    "intro": "Chordifex jacksonii, commonly known as Jackson's featherplant, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces delicate, white or pale blue flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. Chordifex jacksonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
