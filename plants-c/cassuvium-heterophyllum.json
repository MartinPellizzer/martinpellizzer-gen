    "intro": "Cassuvium heterophyllum, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming at night. Its fruit is a fleshy, orange-red berry that contains several seeds. Cassuvium heterophyllum is often found growing in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand prolonged drought conditions."
