    "intro": "Croton patulus, commonly known as the broadleaf croton, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, spiny capsules containing seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its striking foliage, it is occasionally cultivated as an ornamental plant."
