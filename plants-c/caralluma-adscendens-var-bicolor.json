    "intro": "Caralluma adscendens var. bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored prickly pear cactus, is a succulent native to the arid regions of southern India. It features a branching structure with cylindrical stems that are typically greenish-blue in color, adorned with spines and small, fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick stems and having a slow growth rate. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
