    "intro": "Cryophytum angulatum, commonly known as the angular cryophyte, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in cold and arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, adding a delicate aesthetic to its harsh habitat. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to minimize water loss in its extreme climate. Cryophytum angulatum is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions."
