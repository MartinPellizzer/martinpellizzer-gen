    "intro": "Cynanchum umbrosum, commonly known as black snakeroot, is a perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its woody, creeping stems and dark green, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by distinctive, ribbed seeds enclosed in a spiny capsule. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by livestock and wildlife."
