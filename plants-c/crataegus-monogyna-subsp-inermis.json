    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna subsp. inermis, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thornless stems, which distinguish it from other hawthorn species. The plant produces white or pink flowers in clusters during spring, followed by red berries in the autumn. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. It is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and other moist, well-drained soils."
