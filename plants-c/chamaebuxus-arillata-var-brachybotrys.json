    "intro": "Chamaebuxus arillata var. brachybotrys, commonly known as the dwarf buxus, is a compact evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, leathery foliage with small, oval leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Its slow growth rate and compact form make it ideal for topiary and hedging."
