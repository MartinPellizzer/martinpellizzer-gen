    "intro": "Ceratocaryum caespitosum, commonly known as the African grass or umbrella plant, is a perennial grass native to tropical Africa. It features a distinctive clump-forming growth habit with upright, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in dense, spike-like clusters, which are borne on long, slender stalks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for ornamental and erosion control purposes."
