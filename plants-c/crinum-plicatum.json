    "intro": "Crinum plicatum, commonly known as the pleated crinum, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its large, showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink and bloom in clusters. The plant has strap-like, narrow leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Crinum plicatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to warm, humid climates."
