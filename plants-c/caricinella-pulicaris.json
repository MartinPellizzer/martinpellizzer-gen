    "intro": "Caricinella pulicaris, commonly known as the red-stemmed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in temperate regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces small, clustered flowers in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in aquatic environments. Caricinella pulicaris is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability to fluctuating water levels."
