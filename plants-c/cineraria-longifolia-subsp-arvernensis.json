    "intro": "Cineraria longifolia subsp. arvernensis, commonly known as the Arvernian cineraria, is a perennial plant native to the Pyrenees region of France. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and produces striking blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. It is often found in open meadows and slopes at elevations between 1,200 and 2,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
