    "intro": "Chromolaena extensa, commonly known as candle bush, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that resemble candles, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Chromolaena extensa is known for its rapid growth and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
