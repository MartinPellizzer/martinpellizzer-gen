    "intro": "Cyperus hemisphaericus var. longibracteus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, such as marshes and wetlands, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly curved. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, three-lobed bracts that enclose the flowers. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
