    "intro": "Combretum gloriosum, commonly known as the red flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, flame-like inflorescences that bloom in summer, producing clusters of small, reddish-pink flowers. The plant has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds."
