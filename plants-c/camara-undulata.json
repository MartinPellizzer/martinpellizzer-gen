    "intro": "Camara undulata, commonly known as the wavy camara, is a flowering plant belonging to the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its distinctive wavy-lobed leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Camara undulata thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its ornamental value is limited due to its toxic properties, but it is studied for its potential medicinal compounds."
