    "intro": "Cyrtopodium sarneyanum, commonly known as the Sarney's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in late winter to early spring. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
