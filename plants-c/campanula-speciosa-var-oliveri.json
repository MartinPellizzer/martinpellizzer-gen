It is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms and adaptability."
