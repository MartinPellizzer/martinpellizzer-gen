    "intro": "Calycanthus inodorus, commonly known as the sweetshrub, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown bark and clusters of fragrant, maroon-pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant's leaves are oval-shaped, alternate, and have a smooth texture with a slightly glossy appearance. Calycanthus inodorus thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its unique scent and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to native plant collections."
