    "intro": "Coronilla orbiculata, commonly known as the globular vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its rounded, globular growth habit and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
