    "intro": "Connarus palawanensis, commonly known as the Palawan connarus, is a small evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
