    "intro": "Cadelaria sicula, commonly known as the Sicilian cadelaria, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Sicily. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive umbellate inflorescence. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or limestone soils. Due to habitat loss, Cadelaria sicula is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas on Sicily."
