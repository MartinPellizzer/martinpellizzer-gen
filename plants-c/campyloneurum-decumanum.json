    "intro": "Campyloneurum decumanum, commonly known as the broad-leafed moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. The plant has closely packed, ovate leaves that are often curved or twisted, giving it a distinctive appearance. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the leaf tips. Campyloneurum decumanum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms in its native habitats."
