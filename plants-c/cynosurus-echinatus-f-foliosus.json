    "intro": "Cynosurus echinatus f. foliosus, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a variant of the species Cynosurus echinatus, characterized by its distinctive hairy leaves. It is a grassy plant belonging to the Poaceae family, typically found in moist, well-drained soils in temperate regions. The foliage is dense and often forms low, mat-like growth, making it suitable for ground cover. Its flowering stems are usually shorter than the leaves, with small, spike-like inflorescences. This form is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its compact growth and attractive, textured appearance."
