    "intro": "Carex oxyandra var. globosa, commonly known as the globe sedge, is a perennial plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of grass-like leaves, which give it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its foliage is often a deep green, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
