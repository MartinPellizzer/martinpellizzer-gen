    "intro": "Cucurbita stenosperma, commonly known as the narrow-seeded gourd, is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces elongated, yellow or green fruits with a thin, fibrous rind and a sweet, edible interior. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female blooms, and it relies on insect pollination for reproduction. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in some indigenous cultures for food and crafts."
