    "intro": "Catopsis pisiformis, commonly known as the pigmy broom. It is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. The plant has compact, upright growth with narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Catopsis pisiformis is well adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common sight in coastal landscapes."
