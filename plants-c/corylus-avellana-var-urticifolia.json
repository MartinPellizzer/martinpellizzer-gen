    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. urticifolia, commonly known as the stinging hazel, is a variant of the hazel tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy leaves that can cause skin irritation upon contact, giving it its common name. The plant produces edible nuts similar to those of the common hazel, though they are often smaller and more bitter. It typically grows in woodland areas and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The stinging hazel is valued for its ornamental qualities and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
