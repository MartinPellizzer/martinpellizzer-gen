    "intro": "Callicarpa dichotoma f. albifructa, commonly known as the white-fruited beautyberry, is a variant of the common beautyberry. It is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States, characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible for birds and some mammals but are generally not palatable to humans. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and striking fruit display."
