    "intro": "Croton nitrariifolius var. tenerrimus, commonly known as the Desert Croton, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It features small, ovate leaves with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can tolerate high temperatures and limited rainfall. Its resilience makes it a valuable plant for ecological restoration in degraded landscapes."
