    "intro": "Crepis alaica, commonly known as the Alaskan hairgrass, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, dandelion-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its leaves are usually hairy and narrow, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Crepis alaica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is often found in tundra and alpine ecosystems."
