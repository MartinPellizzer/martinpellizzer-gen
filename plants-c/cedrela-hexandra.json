    "intro": "Cedrela hexandra, commonly known as African teak, is a tropical tree native to regions of Africa and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree's heartwood is highly valued for its durability, fine grain, and resistance to decay, making it a sought-after timber species. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is classified as a vulnerable species in some areas."
