    "intro": "Ceanothus perennis, commonly known as coastal ceanothus, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It features evergreen foliage with leathery, dark green leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant blue or purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for coastal gardens. Ceanothus perennis is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
