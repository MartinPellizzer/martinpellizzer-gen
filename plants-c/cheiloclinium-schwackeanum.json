    "intro": "Cheiloclinium schwackeanum, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of certain trees, primarily in the genus *Eucalyptus*. It produces small, white or pale green berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance, which helps in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host tree's vascular system. It is native to Australia and is often found in coastal regions with a Mediterranean climate. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host and is considered a potential threat to certain tree species."
