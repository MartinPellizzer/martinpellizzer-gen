    "intro": "Clinopodium glandulosum, commonly known as sticky betony, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are often covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving the plant its \"glandulosum\" designation. Clinopodium glandulosum is often found in moist meadows and woodland edges, and it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
