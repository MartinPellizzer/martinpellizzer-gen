    "intro": "Carex spicigera subsp. minor, commonly known as the slender tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and forms dense clumps, which help stabilize soil in wetland environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
