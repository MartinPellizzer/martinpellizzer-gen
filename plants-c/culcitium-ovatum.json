    "intro": "Culcitium ovatum, commonly known as the eggplant orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, elongated flower spikes that resemble eggplants. The plant produces showy, often fragrant flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, which bloom sequentially along the stem. Culcitium ovatum thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
