    "intro": "Clethra glauca, commonly known as sweet pepperbush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. Clethra glauca thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and streambanks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
