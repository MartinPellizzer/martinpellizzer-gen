    "intro": "Cinchona peruviana var. reicheliana, commonly known as the Peruvian quinine tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and striking red flowers. The plant is notable for its high concentration of quinine, a compound historically used in the treatment of malaria. Its bark has been traditionally harvested for medicinal purposes, although its use has declined with the advent of synthetic alternatives. This variant is often distinguished from other cinchona species by its unique floral structure and leaf morphology."
