    "intro": "Chenopodium truncatum, commonly known as broad-leaved goosefoot, is a flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, broadly ovate leaves with a waxy surface and a truncate or notched base. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically in late summer to early autumn. It is native to temperate regions of the Americas and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. Chenopodium truncatum is sometimes cultivated as a leaf vegetable in some cuisines due to its mild, slightly tart flavor."
