    "intro": "Cynanchum echinatum, commonly known as the spiny milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its milky sap, which can be toxic. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. Its leaves are opposite, lanceolate, and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are clustered in umbels and are usually pink or purple in color. Cynanchum echinatum plays a role in supporting local ecosystems, though its toxicity limits its use in horticulture."
