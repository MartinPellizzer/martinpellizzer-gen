    "intro": "Cocculus macrocarpus, commonly known as the large-fruited devil's-bit, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive, twisted stems. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that are followed by large, spiny fruits containing toxic seeds. Its botanical features make it a notable species in ecological and horticultural contexts. However, due to its toxic properties, it is not recommended for cultivation in residential areas."
