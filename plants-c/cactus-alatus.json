    "intro": "Cactus alatus, commonly known as the flat-topped cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems that are covered in clusters of spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Cactus alatus is often found in rocky soils and is well adapted to full sun exposure."
