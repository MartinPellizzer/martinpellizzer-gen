    "intro": "Chaetanthera glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its glandular hairs that give it a sticky texture, and its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or violet. It produces small, rounded berries that are toxic to humans and animals. The botanical features of Chaetanthera glandulosa make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
