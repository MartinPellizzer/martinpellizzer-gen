    "intro": "Cereus serratus, commonly known as the serrated cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and spiny, segmented structure, which helps it retain water in its natural habitat. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to dry conditions. Cereus serratus is often cultivated for its striking appearance and resilience in harsh environments."
