    "intro": "Castilleja integra, commonly known as the Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking red, orange, or yellow flowers that resemble a brush. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb nutrients from host plants, making it a partial parasite. Its showy bracts are often mistaken for petals, and it typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Castilleja integra plays an important role in pollination and is a popular subject in native plant gardens."
