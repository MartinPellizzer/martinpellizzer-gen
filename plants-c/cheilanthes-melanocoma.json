    "intro": "Cheilanthes melanocoma, commonly known as the black-stemmed rock fern, is a species of fern found primarily in arid and rocky environments. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, drought-tolerant growth habit. The plant has dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive blackish stem, which helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions. It typically grows on limestone or sandstone, often in crevices or on rock surfaces. Cheilanthes melanocoma is well adapted to low-nutrient soils and can thrive in regions with limited rainfall."
