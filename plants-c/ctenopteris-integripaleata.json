    "intro": "Ctenopteris integripaleata, commonly known as the broad-leaf sea grape, is a species of fern native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, serrated fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found growing near the shoreline or in mangrove areas. Its rhizomes are robust and help anchor it in sandy or muddy soils. The fronds are used in traditional medicine and are also appreciated for their ornamental value in horticulture."
