    "intro": "Catopsis nitida, commonly known as the narrow-leafed catopsis, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Catopsis nitida is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
