    "intro": "Calyptranthes manuensis, commonly known as the Manu calyptranthe, is a small evergreen shrub native to the cloud forests of Peru. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by distinctive, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found at higher elevations in the Andes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
