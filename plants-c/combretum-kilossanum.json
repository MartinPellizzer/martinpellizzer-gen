    "intro": "Combretum kilossanum, commonly known as the red-flowered combretum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and lanceolate leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, which bloom during the dry season. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release small, winged seeds. Combretum kilossanum is often found in dry forests and woodlands, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
