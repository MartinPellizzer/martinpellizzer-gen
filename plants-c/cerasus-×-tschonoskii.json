    "intro": "Cerasus \u00d7 tschonoskii, commonly known as the Chinese sweet cherry, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Prunus pseudocerasus (Chinese cherry) and Prunus avium (European sweet cherry). It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by sweet, juicy red or yellow fruits in late summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. Cerasus \u00d7 tschonoskii is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruits, making it a popular choice in gardens and orchards."
