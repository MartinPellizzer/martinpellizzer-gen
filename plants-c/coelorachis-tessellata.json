    "intro": "Coelorachis tessellata, commonly known as the tessellated fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of sori, which are the spore-producing structures. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are robust and help it spread vegetatively, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. The tessellated pattern on its fronds gives it a distinctive appearance, making it a popular choice for ornamental aquatic gardening."
