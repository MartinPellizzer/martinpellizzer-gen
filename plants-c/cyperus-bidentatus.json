    "intro": "Cyperus bidentatus, commonly known as the two-tooth sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas, along stream banks, or in swampy habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that are usually pale green to brown in color. Cyperus bidentatus is characterized by its distinctive two-toothed bracts at the base of its flowering spikes. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
