    "intro": "Chuquiraga spinosa subsp. spinosa, commonly known as the Peruvian burr or Andean burr, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its spiny, glandular stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by distinctive, spherical fruits that contain seeds with hooked bristles. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils at high elevations. Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, it is of interest in both horticultural and ecological studies."
