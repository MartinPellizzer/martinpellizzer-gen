    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum cercanthum, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its pendulous, bell-shaped flowers that are typically golden yellow in color. Native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. The flowers are adorned with intricate patterns and are often visited by specific pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cirrhopetalum cercanthum is considered a vulnerable species."
