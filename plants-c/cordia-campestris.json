    "intro": "Cordia campestris, commonly known as the roadside cordia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree that typically grows in open, sunny habitats. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture, while the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds. Cordia campestris is often used in traditional medicine and has ecological value as a source of food for wildlife."
