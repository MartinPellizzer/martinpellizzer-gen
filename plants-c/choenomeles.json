    "intro": "Choenomeles, commonly known as Japanese flowering quince, is a genus of deciduous shrubs native to East Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves appear. The plants produce edible fruits that are typically harvested in the fall, though they are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. Choenomeles species are valued for their ornamental value and hardiness in temperate climates. They prefer well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
