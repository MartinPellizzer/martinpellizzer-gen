It is a herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, temperate environments, often found in meadows and woodland edges. The plant features finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
