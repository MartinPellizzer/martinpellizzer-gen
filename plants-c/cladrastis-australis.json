It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in shades of white to pale yellow. The tree has a slender, upright growth habit with smooth, grayish bark that becomes fissured with age. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its showy floral display."
