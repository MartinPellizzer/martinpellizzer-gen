    "intro": "Campanula bononiensis var. simplex, commonly known as the simple bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe. It features upright stems with lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of blue or violet, during the summer months. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
