    "intro": "Cephalorrhynchus kossinskyi, commonly known as the Kossinsky's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a single, showy flower with a distinctive hood-like lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in humid, shaded forest environments. Its botanical features include slender, wiry stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species, making it a subject of interest for conservation botanists."
