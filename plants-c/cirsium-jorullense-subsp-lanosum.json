    "intro": "Cirsium jorullense subsp. lanosum, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, lobed leaves covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces showy purple to violet flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a spherical inflorescence. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and open woodlands. Its hairy foliage and spiny structure serve as adaptations for deterring herbivores and reducing water loss."
