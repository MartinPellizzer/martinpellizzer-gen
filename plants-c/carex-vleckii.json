It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to saturated soil conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are usually wind-pollinated. Vleck's sedge plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
