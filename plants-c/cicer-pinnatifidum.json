    "intro": "Cicer pinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vetch, is a leguminous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are pinnatifid, meaning they are deeply divided into three leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Cicer pinnatifidum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in dry, sunny environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
