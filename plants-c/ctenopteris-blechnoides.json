    "intro": "Ctenopteris blechnoides, commonly known as the fern with a twist, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate fronds that are often twisted or curled. The fronds are typically green and can reach lengths of up to several meters, contributing to the plant's striking appearance. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
