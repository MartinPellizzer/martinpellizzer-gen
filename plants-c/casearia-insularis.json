    "intro": "Casearia insularis, commonly known as the island casearia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in sandy or limestone soils. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
