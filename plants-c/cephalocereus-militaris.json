    "intro": "Cephalocereus militaris, commonly known as the Mexican moon cactus, is a cactus species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive red or orange-colored flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. The plant has a short, thick stem with a single, spiny areole, and its roots are adapted to absorb moisture efficiently from the dry environment. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for desert gardens. The plant's unique appearance and nocturnal flowering make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
