    "intro": "Conyza rudis, commonly known as roughleaf groundsel, is an annual flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in grasslands, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Its leaves are rough and hairy, and it produces small yellow flowers that develop into fluffy seeds. Conyza rudis is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to accumulate heavy metals."
