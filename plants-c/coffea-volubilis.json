    "intro": "Coffea volubilis, commonly known as the climbing coffee plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its trailing growth habit and is often found growing along trees or shrubs. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy surface. While not widely cultivated for coffee production, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and ecological role."
