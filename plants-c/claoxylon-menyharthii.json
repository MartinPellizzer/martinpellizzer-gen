    "intro": "Claoxylon menyharthii, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued for its scent and durability. The tree has smooth, greyish bark and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by globose, woody fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
