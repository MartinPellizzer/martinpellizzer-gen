    "intro": "Cerastium speciosum var. adenophorum, commonly known as the showy mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features prostrate or ascending stems covered in soft, fuzzy hairs, and its leaves are typically rounded or ovate with a hairy surface. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowering stems often bear glandular structures, giving it the specific epithet *adenophorum*."
