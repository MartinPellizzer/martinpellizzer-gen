    "intro": "Claytonia corymbosa, commonly known as the Sierra starflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of star-shaped white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland settings. Claytonia corymbosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its delicate, frost-resistant blooms."
