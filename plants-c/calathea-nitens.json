    "intro": "Calathea nitens, commonly known as the velvet leaf calathea, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with intricate, veined patterns that change color in response to light, a phenomenon called nyctinasty. The plant belongs to the Marantaceae family and is prized for its ornamental value in both indoor and outdoor settings. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Calathea nitens is also known for its air-purifying properties, making it a popular choice for enhancing indoor environments."
