    "intro": "Cynanchum duidae, commonly known as the Chinese milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its fruits are follicles containing toxic seeds. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties. However, due to its toxic nature, it should be handled with care."
