    "intro": "Campanula latifolia var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early summer."
