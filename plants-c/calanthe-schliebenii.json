    "intro": "Calanthe schliebenii, commonly known as the Schlieben's calanthe, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its elegant, lance-shaped leaves and its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to establish itself in rocky or mossy substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
