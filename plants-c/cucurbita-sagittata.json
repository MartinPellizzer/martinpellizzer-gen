    "intro": "Cucurbita sagittata, commonly known as the arrowleaf pumpkin, is a species of flowering plant in the Cucurbitaceae family. It is native to the southern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in warm, sunny climates. The plant produces large, heart-shaped or arrow-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that give way to orange, elongated fruits. Its fruits are often used in culinary applications, though they are not as commonly consumed as other squash varieties. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional agriculture."
