It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves and a mat-forming growth habit, often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. It is part of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its stoloniferous stems that root at the nodes. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
