    "intro": "Cycas circinalis f. undulata, commonly known as the undulating cycas, is a rare and ancient cycad species native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, undulating leaflets that give it a unique appearance compared to other cycads. The plant has a robust, unbranched trunk and produces large, cone-like structures for reproduction. Its foliage is often dense and provides habitat for various small animals and insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
