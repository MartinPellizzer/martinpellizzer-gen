    "intro": "Cryptocarya andamanica, commonly known as the Andaman cryptocarya, is a species of flowering plant in the Lauraceae family. It is native to the Andaman Islands in the Indian Ocean and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in panicles, and it produces black, berry-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native region."
