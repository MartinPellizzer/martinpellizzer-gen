    "intro": "Crusea variabilis, commonly known as the variable crusea, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. Crusea variabilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
