    "intro": "Carduus collinus subsp. cylindricus, commonly known as the cylindrical thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, woolly leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a single, prominent head, which is surrounded by several rows of bracts. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range."
