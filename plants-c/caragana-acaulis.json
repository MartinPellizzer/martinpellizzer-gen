    "intro": "Caragana acaulis, commonly known as the creeping shrub or sand sagebrush, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, woody stems that often form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and often lack true leaf blades, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Caragana acaulis is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a valuable plant for soil stabilization and ecological restoration."
