It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The leaves are oval to lanceolate, often with toothed margins, and are arranged alternately along the stem. This subspecies thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and naturalized areas."
