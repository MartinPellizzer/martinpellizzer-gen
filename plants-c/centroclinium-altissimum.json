    "intro": "Centroclinium altissimum, commonly known as the tall centrolepis, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a compact cluster. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly seen in its natural habitat."
