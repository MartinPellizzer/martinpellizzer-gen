    "intro": "Chamaecassia laevigata, commonly known as the silky filbert, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth, velvety texture that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by elongated, tubular fruits containing edible nuts. Its botanical characteristics include a woody stem, hairy foliage, and a preference for moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
