    "intro": "Cotoneaster subadpressus, commonly known as the narrowleaf cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and is characterized by its slender, often arching branches. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red or orange berries in the autumn. Its leaves are elliptical, with a slightly serrated margin, and they turn a vibrant yellow in the fall. Cotoneaster subadpressus is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
