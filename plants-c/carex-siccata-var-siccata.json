    "intro": "Carex siccata var. siccata, commonly known as the dry sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like flower clusters. Native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, this plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks or in wet meadows. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
