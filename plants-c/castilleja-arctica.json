    "intro": "Castilleja arctica, commonly known as Arctic milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in open, rocky or sandy habitats, often in tundra environments. Castilleja arctica plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems in its cold, harsh habitat."
