    "intro": "Cyperus cancellatus, commonly known as the zigzag sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to aquatic conditions. Its flowering spikes are usually slender and produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. Cyperus cancellatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
