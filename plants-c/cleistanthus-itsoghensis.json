    "intro": "Cleistanthus itsoghensis, commonly known as the Cameroon cleistanthus, is a flowering plant species native to the tropical rainforests of West Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. It produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Due to its restricted habitat and limited study, Cleistanthus itsoghensis remains a relatively understudied species in botanical research."
