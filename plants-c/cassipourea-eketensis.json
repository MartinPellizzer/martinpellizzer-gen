    "intro": "Cassipourea eketensis, commonly known as the Eket mangosteen, is a small evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves and clusters of small white flowers. The plant produces edible, segmented fruits that are similar in appearance to mangosteen but have a distinct flavor. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
