It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that often feature intricate patterns and shades of green, silver, and purple. The plant's foliage is known to fold shut at night, a behavior that gives it its common name. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent humidity and well-draining soil. Calathea multispicata is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
