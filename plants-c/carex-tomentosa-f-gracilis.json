    "intro": "Carex tomentosa f. gracilis, commonly known as the soft-haired sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, fuzzy layer of hairs. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or brown in color, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wet environments."
