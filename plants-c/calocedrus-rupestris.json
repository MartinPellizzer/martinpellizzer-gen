    "intro": "Calocedrus rupestris, commonly known as the Sierra red cedar, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its reddish-brown bark and scale-like leaves that are aromatic and closely pressed to the stems. The tree produces small, round cones that release seeds, contributing to its reproductive cycle. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of ecological study."
