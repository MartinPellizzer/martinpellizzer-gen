    "intro": "Ctenitis kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu fern, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the mountainous regions of Borneo. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate fronds with a distinctive, serrated edge. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, typically above 1,500 meters. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds, a feature common among ferns. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern."
