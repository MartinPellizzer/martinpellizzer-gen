    "intro": "Cyrtochilum dipterum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments within cloud forests. The plant features elongated, narrow leaves and produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. Cyrtochilum dipterum is characterized by its specialized root system that allows it to absorb moisture from the forest floor. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
