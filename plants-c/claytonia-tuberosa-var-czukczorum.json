    "intro": "Claytonia tuberosa var. czukczorum, commonly known as the Czukczo Mountain chickweed, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Andes in South America. It is a perennial herb with a low-growing, mat-forming habit, characterized by rosettes of fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
