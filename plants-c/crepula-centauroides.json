    "intro": "Crepula centauroides, commonly known as the centaur's shield, is a unique and rare plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its growth habit is low and mat-like, with a compact structure that helps it thrive in rocky or arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
