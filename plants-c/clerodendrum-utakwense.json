    "intro": "Clerodendrum utakwense, commonly known as the African flame bush, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, which are typically arranged in terminal panicles. These flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by animals. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens."
