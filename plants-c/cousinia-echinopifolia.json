    "intro": "Cousinia echinopifolia, commonly known as the hairy cushion flower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, providing additional protection against desiccation. Cousinia echinopifolia is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy species in semi-arid climates."
