    "intro": "Castrilanthemum, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a genus of flowering plants in the Apocynaceae family. It is native to the Americas, particularly South America, and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that open at night. The plants typically have thick, fleshy stems and spiny leaves, adapted to arid environments. They are popular in horticulture for their dramatic, fragrant blooms that appear after sunset. Castrilanthemum species are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their unique blooming habits and striking appearance."
