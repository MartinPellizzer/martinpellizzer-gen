    "intro": "Cirsium maackii var. spinossimum, commonly known as the Maack's thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and large, showy purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and riverbanks. Its stems are upright and often covered with stiff, prickly hairs. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
