    "intro": "Cyperus trigonus, commonly known as the triangular flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is a perennial herb characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, such as marshes and wetlands. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. Cyperus trigonus is often found in tropical and subtropical regions and is adapted to waterlogged soils."
