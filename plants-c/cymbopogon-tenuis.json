    "intro": "Cymbopogon tenuis, commonly known as narrowleaf lemon grass, is a perennial grass native to Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are often aromatic and contain essential oils. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Cymbopogon tenuis is sometimes used in traditional medicine and for its aromatic properties."
