    "intro": "Callipteris stolzei, commonly known as the coastal panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in coastal environments, tolerating salty air and sandy soils with minimal water. Its flowering spikes produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. Callipteris stolzei plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in coastal ecosystems."
