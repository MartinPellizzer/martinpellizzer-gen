    "intro": "Cordylanthus eremicus, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Cordylanthus eremicus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife in its native range."
