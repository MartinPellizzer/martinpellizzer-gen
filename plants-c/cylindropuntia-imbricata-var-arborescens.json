    "intro": "Cylindropuntia imbricata var. arborescens, commonly known as the tree cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its branching, tree-like structure composed of cylindrical, spiny stems. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, round fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. This plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for desert climates."
