    "intro": "Crocodilodes seminivea, commonly known as the snowflake orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, white, star-shaped flowers that resemble snowflakes. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific conditions to bloom, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, fleshy roots that help it survive in its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Crocodilodes seminivea is considered an endangered species."
