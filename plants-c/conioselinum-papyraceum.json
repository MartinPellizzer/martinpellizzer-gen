    "intro": "Conioselinum papyraceum, commonly known as the paperleaf tansy, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, branching stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are finely divided, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its foliage is notable for its papery texture, which is why it is also called paperleaf tansy. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands."
