    "intro": "Cytisus hirsutus var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine broom, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often sparsely branched stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets that are hairy, giving the plant its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
