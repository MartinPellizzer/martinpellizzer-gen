    "intro": "Calamus belumutensis, commonly known as the Bornean calamus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to the rainforests of Borneo and is characterized by its long, slender rhizomes and narrow, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces inflorescences that consist of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or wetland areas. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Calamus belumutensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research."
