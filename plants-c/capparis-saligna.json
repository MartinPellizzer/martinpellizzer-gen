It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, green, round fruits that turn red when ripe. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in maritime climates. Its botanical features make it well adapted to salt spray and coastal winds."
