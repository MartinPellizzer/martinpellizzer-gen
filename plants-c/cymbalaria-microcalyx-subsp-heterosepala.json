The plant features opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are clustered in racemes and are characterized by their tubular shape and two-lipped structure, typical of the Scrophulariaceae family. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds."
