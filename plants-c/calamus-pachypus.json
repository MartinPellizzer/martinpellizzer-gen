    "intro": "Calamus pachypus, commonly known as the broad-leaved calamus, is a member of the Arecaceae family, native to Southeast Asia. It is a robust perennial plant characterized by its thick, segmented rhizomes and broad, arching leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowering stems produce panicles of small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers, followed by small, round fruits. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
