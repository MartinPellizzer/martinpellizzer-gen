    "intro": "Cercis canadensis var. typica, commonly known as the Eastern Redbud, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, flat, bean-like fruits that mature in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The Eastern Redbud is also valued for its role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects."
