    "intro": "Causonis fugongensis, commonly known as the Fugong sea holly, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of China. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and woolly foliage. The plant typically grows in saline or brackish environments, adapting to high salt concentrations and tidal influences. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense clusters, and bloom during the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
