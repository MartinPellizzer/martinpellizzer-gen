    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 smithii, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature for trapping pollinators. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with dark green, pleated leaves and a single, showy flower that can be pink, white, or yellow. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in temperate forests, where it forms part of the understory vegetation."
