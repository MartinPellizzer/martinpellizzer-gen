    "intro": "Cephalotaxus fortunei subsp. alpina, commonly known as the Alpine Nutmeg Tree, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching form and dark green, scale-like leaves that are densely packed along the stems. The plant produces unique, fleshy, orange-red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in cool, moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested habitats at high elevations. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
