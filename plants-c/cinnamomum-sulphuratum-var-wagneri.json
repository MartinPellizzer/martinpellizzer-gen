    "intro": "Cinnamomum sulphuratum var. wagneri, commonly known as Wagner's cinnamon, is a rare and lesser-known species within the\u6a1f\u6811 family (Lauraceae). It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province, where it thrives in humid, temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. Its bark, similar to other cinnamon species, contains essential oils and has been traditionally used in herbal medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
