It is characterized by its clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings.
