    "intro": "Carex rostrata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The leaves are broad and flat, with a waxy surface that helps repel water, a feature common in wetland plants. It thrives in moist to aquatic conditions, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. This plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
