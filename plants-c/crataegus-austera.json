    "intro": "Crataegus austera, commonly known as the Austrian hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 meters, featuring thorny branches and clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often used in jams and wines. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with finely toothed margins, and it is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Crataegus austera is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
