    "intro": "Cibotium assamicum, commonly known as the Assam tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the humid forests of northeastern India. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a distinctive, fibrous root system that helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside. Cibotium assamicum plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
