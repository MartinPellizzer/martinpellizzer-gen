    "intro": "Callipeltis factorovskyi, commonly known as the Factorovsky's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, meaning it forms new shoots from the base of the previous growth. Its roots are adapted for epiphytic growth, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The orchid is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or tropical gardens."
