It is characterized by its distinctive single, broad, arrowhead-shaped leaf that floats on the water surface. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
