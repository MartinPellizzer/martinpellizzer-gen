    "intro": "Cracca hirta, commonly known as the hairy cracca, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. Its hairy stems and leaves are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The showy yellow flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance."
