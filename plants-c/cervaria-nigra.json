    "intro": "Cervaria nigra, commonly known as black crowfoot, is a flowering plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, blackish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, calcareous soils along stream banks and woodland edges. It has a short growing season and is often overlooked due to its unassuming appearance. Despite its modest size, it plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
