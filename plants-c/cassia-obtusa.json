    "intro": "Cassia obtusa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cassia, is a deciduous shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender leaves that are often feather-like in appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in elongated pods and are used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties. Cassia obtusa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
