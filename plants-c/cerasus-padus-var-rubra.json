    "intro": "Cerasus padus var. rubra, commonly known as the red cherry tree, is a variant of the European bird cherry. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters. The plant is characterized by its vibrant red flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated edge, while the fruits are small, round cherries that turn from yellow to red as they mature. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
