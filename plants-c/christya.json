    "intro": "Christya, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Nymphaeaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, buoyant stalks. The plant has floating leaves that are typically heart-shaped and covered in a waxy layer to repel water. Its roots grow in muddy substrates, and it plays a significant role in both ecological and cultural contexts. Christya is also valued for its ability to purify water and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
