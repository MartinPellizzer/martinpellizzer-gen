    "intro": "Carex ballsii, commonly known as ball sedge, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, rounded clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a compact, ball-like shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spikelets. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Carex ballsii is valued in landscaping for its ornamental appearance and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
