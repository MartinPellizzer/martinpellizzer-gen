    "intro": "Cyperus difformis var. subdecompositus, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, where it thrives in shallow water or saturated soil. Its botanical features include a rhizomatous root system and small, three-lobed flowers arranged in dense clusters. This variant is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich habitats, contributing to its ecological adaptability."
