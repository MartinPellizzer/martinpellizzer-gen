It is native to the coastal regions of the northern Adriatic, particularly in Croatia and Italy. This plant is characterized by its low-growing shrub form and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white. The leaves are leathery and evergreen, adapting well to the moist, acidic soils of its coastal habitat. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy or rocky shorelines."
