    "intro": "Calonemorchis horistes, commonly known as the horistes orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, often fragrant flowers that display a range of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as mountain forests, where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its botanical features include slender stems, lance-shaped leaves, and a compact inflorescence that supports its unique floral display. Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
