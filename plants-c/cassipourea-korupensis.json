It is native to the rainforests of Cameroon and is typically found in humid, shaded environments. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, round fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
