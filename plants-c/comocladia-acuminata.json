    "intro": "Comocladia acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous shrub that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils near the shoreline. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in coastal environments. Comocladia acuminata is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
