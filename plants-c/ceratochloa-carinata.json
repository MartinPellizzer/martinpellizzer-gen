    "intro": "Ceratochloa carinata, commonly known as the ridge grass, is a perennial grass species native to various parts of Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often adorned with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
