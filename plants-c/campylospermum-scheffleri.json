    "intro": "Campylospermum scheffleri, commonly known as the rock fig, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in arid and rocky environments, showing high drought tolerance. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in xerophytic plant adaptations."
