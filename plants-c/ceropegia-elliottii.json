It features fleshy, tuberous roots and produces delicate, waxy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ceropegia elliottii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and ease of care."
