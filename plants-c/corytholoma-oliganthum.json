    "intro": "Corytholoma oliganthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved corytholoma, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and unique, clustered inflorescences that resemble a crown, giving it its genus name. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its flowers are typically pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
