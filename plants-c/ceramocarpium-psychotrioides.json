    "intro": "Ceramocarpium psychotrioides, commonly known as the psychotrioides ceramocarpium, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, dry fruits called achene, which are typically covered in a hard, protective coat. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
