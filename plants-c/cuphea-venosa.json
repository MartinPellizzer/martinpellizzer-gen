    "intro": "Cuphea venosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf cuphea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, velvety red bracts that surround its small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. Cuphea venosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
