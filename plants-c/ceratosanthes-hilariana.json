    "intro": "Ceratosanthes hilariana, commonly known as the Happy Ghost Plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance due to its translucent, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shade gardens and containers."
