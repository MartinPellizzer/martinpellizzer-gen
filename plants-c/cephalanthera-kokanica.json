    "intro": "Cephalanthera kokanica, commonly known as the Kokanica orchid, is a species of terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Europe and Turkey. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and woodlands. It has a rhizomatous root system and produces showy, spurred petals that attract pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
