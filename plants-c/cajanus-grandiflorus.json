    "intro": "Cajanus grandiflorus, commonly known as the large-flowered pigeon pea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in hard pods and are used for both ornamental and agricultural purposes. Cajanus grandiflorus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial in crop rotation systems."
