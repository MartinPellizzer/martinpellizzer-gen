    "intro": "Castilleja trainii, commonly known as the Sierra redshank, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open coniferous forests and meadows, often forming dense colonies. Its roots penetrate the roots of neighboring plants, drawing nutrients and water from them. Castilleja trainii plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host for various insects."
