    "intro": "Corycium excisum, commonly known as the excised corycium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and vines, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant features opposite, elliptical leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with five petals. Corycium excisum is known for its unique leaf morphology, which includes deep incisions that give it its common name. Due to its restricted habitat and conservation status, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
