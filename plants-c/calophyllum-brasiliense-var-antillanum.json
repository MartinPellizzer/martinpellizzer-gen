    "intro": "Calophyllum brasiliense var. antillanum, commonly known as the Caribbean mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark reddish-brown bark and large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces yellowish flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. It is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and cabinetry. However, due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
