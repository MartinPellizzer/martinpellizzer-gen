It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne on slender, leafy stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
