    "intro": "Campylandra kwangtungensis, commonly known as the Guangdong campylandra, is a rare flowering plant native to southern China. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth texture, while its stems are slender and often trailing. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
