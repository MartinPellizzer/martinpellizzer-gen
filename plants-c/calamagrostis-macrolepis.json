It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
