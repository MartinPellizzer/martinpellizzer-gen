    "intro": "Ceraria fruticulosa, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Goodeniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and is often found in coastal areas, particularly in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its saline environment. Ceraria fruticulosa is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species."
