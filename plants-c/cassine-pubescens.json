    "intro": "Cassine pubescens, commonly known as the silky hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its smooth, light-gray bark and heart-shaped leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by round, red berries that are edible for birds and small mammals. Cassine pubescens is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forested areas. Its unique botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems."
