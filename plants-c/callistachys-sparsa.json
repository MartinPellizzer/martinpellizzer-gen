    "intro": "Callistachys sparsa, commonly known as the sparse callistachy, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its slender, often sparsely foliaged stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically appearing in spring. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its often arid or semi-arid habitat. Callistachys sparsa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
