    "intro": "Cyanus, commonly known as the cornflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright blue or purple flowers, which are typically radially symmetrical and arranged in a composite head. The plants are native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and many species are cultivated for their ornamental value. Cyanus species often thrive in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making them popular in gardens and wildflower meadows. Their flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological biodiversity."
