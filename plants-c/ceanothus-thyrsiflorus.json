    "intro": "Ceanothus thyrsiflorus, commonly known as the California buckthorn, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor, rocky soils. Ceanothus thyrsiflorus plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife."
