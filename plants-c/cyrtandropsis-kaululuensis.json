    "intro": "Cyrtandropsis kaululuensis, commonly known as the Kaululuensis cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family native to Madagascar. It is a small, slow-growing cycad characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of pinnate, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female plants. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying cycad evolution and ecological adaptation in tropical environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant."
