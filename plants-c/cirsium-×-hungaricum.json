    "intro": "Cirsium \u00d7 hungaricum, commonly known as the Hungarian thistle, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Central Europe, this plant thrives in dry, disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides and in open fields. It is an erect perennial that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, with a distinctive rough texture on its stems. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed but also has historical uses in herbal medicine."
