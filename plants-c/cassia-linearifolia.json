It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are often arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in long, slender pods, which contain several angular, dark brown seeds. Cassia linearifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in herbal medicine."
