    "intro": "Calanthe millikenii, commonly known as the Milliken's calanthe, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pale pink, bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calanthe millikenii is considered a conservation concern."
