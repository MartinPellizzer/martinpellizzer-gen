    "intro": "Chloanthes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom on a single stem. The plant relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient uptake, as it cannot photosynthesize due to the absence of chlorophyll. Its delicate structure and translucent appearance make it a striking yet fragile species. Conservation efforts are crucial due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes."
