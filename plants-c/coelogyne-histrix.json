    "intro": "Coelogyne histrix, commonly known as the hairy coelogyne, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves and dense clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. Coelogyne histrix is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
