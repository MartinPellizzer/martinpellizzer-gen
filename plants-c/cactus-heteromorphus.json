    "intro": "Cactus heteromorphus, commonly known as the jumping cholla, is a spineless cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its branching, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 10 feet tall. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by small, red fruits. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is a key species in its native range."
