    "intro": "Cyperus vulnerans, commonly known as the bleeding rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with cylindrical, often reddish stems. The plant is notable for its ability to exude a milky sap when injured, which can cause a staining effect, hence its common name. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along water bodies. Cyperus vulnerans is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
