    "intro": "Cerastium micropetalum, commonly known as the lesser snowdrop, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces tiny, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Cerastium micropetalum is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates."
