    "intro": "Cicendia stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb with slender, ascending stems that often grow in dry, open habitats. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Cicendia stricta is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
