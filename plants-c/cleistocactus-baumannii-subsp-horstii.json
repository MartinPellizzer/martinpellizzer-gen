It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and thick, ribbed stems that store water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
