    "intro": "Cyclobothra maweama, commonly known as the Maweama cyclobothra, is a unique plant species native to specific regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered growth habit. The plant features small, green, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. Its flowering structure consists of tiny, clustered umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family, and it produces small, white to pale green flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
