    "intro": "Carex ferruginea subsp. caudata, commonly known as the red-haired sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often reddish-brown at the base, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, greenish-yellow flowers surrounded by bracts. This subspecies is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
