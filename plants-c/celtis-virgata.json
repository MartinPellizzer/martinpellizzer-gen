    "intro": "Celtis virgata, commonly known as the Virgin's tree or the American boxelder, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern and central United States. It belongs to the Ulmaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age. Celtis virgata is often found in moist soils along streams and in wooded areas."
