    "intro": "Cypripedium insigne var. tresederi, commonly known as the Treseder's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in cool, shaded forest environments, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its foliage consists of broad, strap-like leaves, and it produces a single, fragrant flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
