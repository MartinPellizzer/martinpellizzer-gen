    "intro": "Chnoanthus ovatus, commonly known as the white beech or white holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and stream valleys. Chnoanthus ovatus is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
