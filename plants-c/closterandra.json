    "intro": "Closterandra, commonly known as the mountain everlasting or sweet everlasting, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in coastal and mountainous regions. The plant is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to yellow and are often fragrant. Closterandra species are typically shrubs or subshrubs with narrow, aromatic leaves. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in horticulture for their resilience and drought tolerance."
