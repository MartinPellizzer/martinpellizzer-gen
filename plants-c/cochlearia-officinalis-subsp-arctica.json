    "intro": "Cochlearia officinalis subsp. arctica, commonly known as Arctic kidneyweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Arctic and alpine regions. It typically features rosettes of silver-white, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its morphology reflects evolutionary strategies for survival in extreme northern habitats."
