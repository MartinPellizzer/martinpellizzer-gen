    "intro": "Cyperus hawaiiensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian flatsedge, is a grass-like plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in wetland or marshy areas, often found in coastal environments. The plant has slender, grass-like stems and produces small, clustered flower heads that are usually pale green to brown in color. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within Hawaii."
