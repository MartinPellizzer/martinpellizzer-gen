    "intro": "Cleistocactus flavispinus, commonly known as the yellow-spined cleistocactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northern South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, yellowish spines. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which bloom during the warmer months. Its growth habit is generally low and compact, making it well adapted to harsh desert conditions. Cleistocactus flavispinus is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in dry environments with minimal care."
