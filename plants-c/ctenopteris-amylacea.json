    "intro": "Ctenopteris amylacea, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often divided into fine, hair-like segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on rocky surfaces or in moist soil. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to vertical surfaces. Ctenopteris amylacea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of indoor and outdoor settings."
