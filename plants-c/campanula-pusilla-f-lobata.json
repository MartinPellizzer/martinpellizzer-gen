    "intro": "Campanula pusilla f. lobata, commonly known as the lobed bellflower, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to Europe. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to violet in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a slightly lobed margin that distinguishes this form from the typical species. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or containers. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
