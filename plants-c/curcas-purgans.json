    "intro": "Curcas purgans, commonly known as the physic nut or Barbados nut, is a shrub native to the Americas. It is characterized by its spiny stems and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces orange, fleshy fruits that contain toxic seeds. The seeds contain a high concentration of ricin, making them highly poisonous. Despite its dangers, it has been historically used for its laxative properties, though its use is now largely restricted due to its toxicity."
