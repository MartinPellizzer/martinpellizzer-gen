    "intro": "Cyclostemon littoralis, commonly known as the coastal cyclostemon, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that are adapted to tolerate salt spray and sandy soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It is often found growing near the shoreline, where it plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems. Due to its unique adaptations, it is of interest to botanists studying coastal flora and ecological resilience."
