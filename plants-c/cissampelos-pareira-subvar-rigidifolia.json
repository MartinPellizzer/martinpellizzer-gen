    "intro": "Cissampelos pareira subvar. rigidifolia, commonly known as the rigid-stemmed arrowhead vine, is a climbing perennial plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright orange berries. The plant is characterized by its rigid, woody stems that provide structural support as it climbs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. The berries are edible and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
