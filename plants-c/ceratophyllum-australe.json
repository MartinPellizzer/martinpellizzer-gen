    "intro": "Ceratophyllum australe, commonly known as the Australian hornwort, is a freshwater plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and small, scale-like leaves. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its stems and leaves. It thrives in still or slow-moving water and is often found in ponds and lakes. Ceratophyllum australe is noted for its ability to provide habitat for aquatic organisms and improve water clarity."
