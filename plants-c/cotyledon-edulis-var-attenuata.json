    "intro": "Cotyledon edulis var. attenuata, commonly known as the edible cotyledon or \"lamb's ear,\" is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the warmer months. Its leaves are edible and can be used in salads or as a garnish, though they should be harvested before the plant flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it a low-maintenance plant for gardens."
