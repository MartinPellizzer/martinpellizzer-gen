    "intro": "Charybdis aphylla, commonly known as the naked sea anemone, is a unique cnidarian found in marine environments. It lacks a true medusa stage and exists primarily as a polyp, attaching itself to substrates such as rocks or shells. Its body is cylindrical and covered with a thin layer of tissue, giving it a nearly translucent appearance. The organism possesses tentacles that are used for capturing prey, and it lacks a central mouth opening. Botanically, it is classified within the phylum Cnidaria, though it is not a true plant, making it more of a marine invertebrate than a botanical subject."
