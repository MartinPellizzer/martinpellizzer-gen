    "intro": "Clerodendrum incisum var. longepedunculatum, commonly known as the long-pedunculate glorybower, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with contrasting yellow or white markings. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and its stems are often hairy. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The long, slender peduncles (flower stalks) give it its distinctive appearance, making it a popular choice for gardeners and horticulturists."
