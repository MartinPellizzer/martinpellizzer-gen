    "intro": "Caiophora eichleri, commonly known as the Eichleri's caiophora, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in montane forests. Its leaves are broad and oval, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within its native range."
