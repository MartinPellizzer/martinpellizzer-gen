    "intro": "Ceterach cordatum var. capense, commonly known as the coastal ceterach, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, strap-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the cooler months, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in arid conditions."
