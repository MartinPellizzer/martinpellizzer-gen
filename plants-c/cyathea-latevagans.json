It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are typically dark green and have a smooth, leathery texture. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its unique morphology makes it a striking addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes."
