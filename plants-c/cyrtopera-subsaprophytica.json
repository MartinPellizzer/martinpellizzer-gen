    "intro": "Cyrtopera subsaprophytica, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, strap-like leaves and a single, delicate white or pale pink flower that blooms during the rainy season. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas."
