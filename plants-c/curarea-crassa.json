    "intro": "Curarea crassa, commonly known as the giant arrow poison plant, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Erythroxylaceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant is notable for containing curare, a potent neurotoxin used historically by indigenous peoples for hunting. Its roots and stems are harvested for their medicinal and toxic properties. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with caution."
