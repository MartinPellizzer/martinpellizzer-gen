    "intro": "Cassine velutina, commonly known as velvetwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Cassine velutina is adapted to wetland environments and is often found in swamps and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
