    "intro": "Convolvulus althaeoides var. ferrugineus, commonly known as the rusty bindweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb with trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring and summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. This species is sometimes considered invasive in certain regions due to its aggressive growth habit."
