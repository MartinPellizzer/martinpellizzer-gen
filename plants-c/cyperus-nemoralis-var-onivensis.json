    "intro": "Cyperus nemoralis var. onivensis, commonly known as the swamp cyperus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, showcasing a rhizomatous root system that aids in its spread. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to brown flowers. Its botanical structure is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, with nodes along the stems that can root and form new plants. This variant is notable for its ability to thrive in fluctuating water levels, making it a common sight in marshes and along riverbanks."
