    "intro": "Ceropegia ruspoliana, commonly known as the Ghost Plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing stems and distinctive, waxy, tubular flowers that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting it to arid environments. It produces showy, pale green or white flowers that attract specific pollinators like moths. Ceropegia ruspoliana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ease of care."
