    "intro": "Chevaliera depressa, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. Chevaliera depressa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
