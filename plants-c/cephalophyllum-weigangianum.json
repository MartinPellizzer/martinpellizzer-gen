    "intro": "Cephalophyllum weigangianum, commonly known as the Weigang's ghost flower, is a rare and unique member of the Cactaceae family. It is native to a small region in northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and rocky environments. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, spineless stems and striking, umbrella-like clusters of white flowers. Its flowers open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
