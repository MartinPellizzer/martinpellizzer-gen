It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and pinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by long, narrow pods containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in landscaping. Cassia hypoleuca is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
