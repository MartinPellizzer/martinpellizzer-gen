    "intro": "Celastrus caseariifolius, commonly known as the goldenleaf bindweed, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often tinged with yellow on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cymes, followed by orange to reddish berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
