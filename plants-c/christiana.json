    "intro": "Christiana, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a popular ornamental plant belonging to the Cactaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Brazil, where it grows as an epiphyte on trees. The plant is characterized by its segmented stems and vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in winter. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water. Christiana thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
