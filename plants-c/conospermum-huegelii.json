    "intro": "Conospermum huegelii, commonly known as the Grey Box, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its grey-green, fibrous foliage and produces small, yellowish flowers in late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. Conospermum huegelii is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that is well-suited for low-maintenance gardens."
