    "intro": "Cryptadenia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower cryptadenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of eastern Australia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and features elliptical, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, black seeds. Cryptadenia uniflora is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance."
