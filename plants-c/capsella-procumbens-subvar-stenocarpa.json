    "intro": "Capsella procumbens subvar. stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-seeded common mouse-ear. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in groups of three, and it is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release the seeds, a feature typical of the Brassicaceae family. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant."
