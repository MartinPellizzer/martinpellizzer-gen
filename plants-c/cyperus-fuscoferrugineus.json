It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces viable seeds that aid in its propagation. Cyperus fuscoferrugineus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
