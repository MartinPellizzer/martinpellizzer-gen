    "intro": "Chaetocyperus stolonifer, commonly known as the creeping flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant has slender, grass-like stems and produces small, three-angled spikelets that are often clustered at the base. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as swamps and along waterways. Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that can dominate wetland ecosystems."
