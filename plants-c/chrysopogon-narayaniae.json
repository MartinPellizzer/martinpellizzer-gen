    "intro": "Chrysopogon narayaniae, commonly known as the Narayana grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid regions."
