It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. Centropogon floricomus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
