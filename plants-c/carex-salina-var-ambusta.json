It thrives in brackish or saline wetlands, often found in estuaries and tidal marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of greenish to brownish flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an essential component of saltwater ecosystems."
