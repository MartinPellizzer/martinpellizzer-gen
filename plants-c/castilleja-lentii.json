    "intro": "Castilleja lentii, commonly known as the slender leaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange floral bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for water and nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. Castilleja lentii is often found in association with various grasses and forbs, contributing to the ecological diversity of its environment."
