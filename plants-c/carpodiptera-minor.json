    "intro": "Carpodiptera minor, commonly known as the small leafy fern, is a delicate fern species characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which release spores for reproduction. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients. The plant's botanical structure reflects its adaptation to humid, temperate climates."
