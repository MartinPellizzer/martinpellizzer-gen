    "intro": "Chamaedorea lanceolata var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal bamboo palm, is a compact, evergreen plant native to coastal regions of Mexico. It features slender, arching leaves that are typically a deep green, providing a lush, tropical appearance. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance of low light and ability to adapt to moderate humidity. Its slow growth rate makes it an ideal choice for small spaces and container gardening."
