It is characterized by its dense, low-growing form and its ability to thrive in wet, acidic soils. The plant features narrow, dark green leaves that remain on the plant year-round. It produces small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Chamaedaphne latifolia plays a significant role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing erosion."
