    "intro": "Catabrosa aquatica var. subtilis, commonly known as the slender water catabrosa, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes, where it forms dense underwater mats. The plant has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width, contributing to its delicate appearance. Its flowers, which are small and white, are borne on slender stalks and are adapted for pollination by water insects. This variety is notable for its limited distribution and is often found in association with other aquatic flora in its native habitat."
