    "intro": "Cerastium decalvans f. alpicola, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it forms dense mats to conserve moisture and withstand harsh conditions. Its compact growth habit and frost tolerance make it well adapted to cold, mountainous environments. This subspecies is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes, contributing to the biodiversity of high-altitude ecosystems."
