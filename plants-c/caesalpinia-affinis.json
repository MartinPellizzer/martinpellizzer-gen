    "intro": "Caesalpinia affinis, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its bright red or orange floral bracts that resemble flames, which are often more showy than the small, yellow flowers. The plant has bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small leaflets, and its bark is smooth and reddish-brown in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Caesalpinia affinis is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment."
