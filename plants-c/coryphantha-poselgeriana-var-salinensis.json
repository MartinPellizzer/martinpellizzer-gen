    "intro": "Coryphantha poselgeriana var. salinensis, commonly known as the Saline Coryphantha, is a small, spineless cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert. It features a globular or cylindrical stem that is often covered in a whitish, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer, adding a striking contrast to its green stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
