    "intro": "Crataegus antiplasta, commonly known as the blackthorn, is a species of shrub native to Europe, western Asia, and northwestern Africa. It is characterized by its thorny branches, small dark berries, and oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces white to pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by its edible yet tart fruits. Crataegus antiplasta is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and rocky soils, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
