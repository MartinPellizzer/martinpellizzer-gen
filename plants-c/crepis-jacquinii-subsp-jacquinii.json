    "intro": "Crepis jacquinii subsp. jacquinii, commonly known as the Jacquin's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. This subspecies is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it forms dense mats that help stabilize soil in harsh environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
