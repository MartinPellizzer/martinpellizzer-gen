    "intro": "Cerastium commersonii, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Cerastium commersonii is known for its ability to spread rapidly through stolons, forming dense mats that can suppress weeds."
