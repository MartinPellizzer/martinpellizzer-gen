    "intro": "Cadaba triphylla, commonly known as the three-leafed spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, triangular leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens."
