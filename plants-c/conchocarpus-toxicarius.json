    "intro": "Conchocarpus toxicarius, commonly known as the poisonwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, inconspicuous white flowers. The plant produces small, round, fleshy fruits that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves contain toxic compounds, which can cause severe gastrointestinal distress if ingested. Despite its toxic properties, the tree is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though with caution."
