    "intro": "Cercis nitida, commonly known as the Chinese redbud, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or white, which appear before the leaves in early spring. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often exuding a mild fragrance. Cercis nitida is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and adaptability to various soil types."
