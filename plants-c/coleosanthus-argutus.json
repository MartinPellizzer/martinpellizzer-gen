    "intro": "Coleosanthus argutus, commonly known as the rough-leaved sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the year. It thrives in saline and humid environments, often found growing along shores and in mangrove swamps. Its adaptability to coastal conditions makes it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
