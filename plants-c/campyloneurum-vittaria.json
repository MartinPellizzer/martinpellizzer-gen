    "intro": "Campyloneurum vittaria, commonly known as the veined fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually bright green with prominent veins that give it its common name. The reproductive structures, known as sori, are arranged in lines along the undersides of the fronds."
