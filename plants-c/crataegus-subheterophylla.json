    "intro": "Crataegus subheterophylla, commonly known as the variable hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with some leaves being simple and others compound, which gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and is known for its showy white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit is a red or orange pome, which is edible but often used in jams and jellies. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
