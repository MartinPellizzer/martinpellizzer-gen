    "intro": "Cayratia clematidea, commonly known as the silver vine, is a climbing plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Cayratia clematidea is also noted for its ability to climb using its tendrils, making it a common ornamental plant in gardens."
