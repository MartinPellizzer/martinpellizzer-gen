    "intro": "Ctenitis lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Ctenitis lanceolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
