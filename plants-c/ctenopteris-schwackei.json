It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous rainforests. Its rhizome is thick and woody, supporting the plant's rapid growth. The fronds are bi-directionally divided, giving the plant its distinctive, intricate appearance."
