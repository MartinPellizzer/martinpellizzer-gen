    "intro": "Cerastium arvense f. petrovicii, commonly known as the Petrovici's mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, hairy leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in woodland edges and along stream banks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
