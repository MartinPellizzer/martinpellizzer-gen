    "intro": "Centaurea delucae, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters, featuring bright yellow to orange flowers with a distinctive central disk. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. Centaurea delucae plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
