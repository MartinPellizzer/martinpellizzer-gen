    "intro": "Cinnamomum novae-britanniae, commonly known as New Britain cinnamon, is a small evergreen tree native to the island of New Britain in the Solomon Islands. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that contain a single seed, and its bark is used to extract a spice similar to cinnamon. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within the cinnamon genus."
