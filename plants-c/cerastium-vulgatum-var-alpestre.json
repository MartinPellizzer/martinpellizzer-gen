    "intro": "Cerastium vulgatum var. alpestre, commonly known as alpine mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence, aiding in moisture retention in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows, alpine tundra, and rocky slopes. Due to its compact form and ability to tolerate cold climates, it is a hardy species adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
