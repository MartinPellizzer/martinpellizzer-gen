    "intro": "Coptosapelta maluensis, commonly known as the Maluensian sandalwood, is a small tree native to the tropical rainforests of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes other aromatic and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
