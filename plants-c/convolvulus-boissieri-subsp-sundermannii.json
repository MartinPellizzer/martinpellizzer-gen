It is a trailing or climbing herb characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it adapted to harsh, semi-desert environments. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both ecological and horticultural studies."
