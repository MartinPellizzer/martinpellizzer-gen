    "intro": "Copaifera conjugata, commonly known as the Brazilian copaiba, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its reddish-brown bark and large, simple leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Copaifera conjugata is valued for its aromatic resin, which has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species in its native range."
