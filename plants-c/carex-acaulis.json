    "intro": "Carex acaulis, commonly known as the cushion sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It forms dense, compact rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a layer of fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are usually borne on short, upright stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Carex acaulis is adapted to cold climates and is an important component of tundra and alpine ecosystems."
