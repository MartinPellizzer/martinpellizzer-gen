    "intro": "Cynanchum meyeri, commonly known as Meyer's milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist woodlands and along stream banks, reaching heights of up to 2 feet. The plant features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy, yellowish-green flowers bloom in late spring, attracting various pollinators. The milky sap of the plant contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores."
