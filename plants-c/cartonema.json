    "intro": "Cartonema, commonly known as the \"silkweed\" or \"velvetleaf,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, yellow or white flowers that often have five petals. The plants are typically annual or perennial herbs, often found in moist or wet environments. Cartonema species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. They are sometimes considered invasive in certain areas due to their rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative reproduction."
