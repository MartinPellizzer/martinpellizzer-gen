    "intro": "Chaerophyllum byzantinum var. puberulum, commonly known as the rough bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
