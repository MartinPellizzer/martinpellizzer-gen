    "intro": "Cerastium decalvans subsp. silvaticum, commonly known as the forest mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of small, hairy leaves and produces clusters of white flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its leaves are characterized by their rounded shape and soft, woolly texture. It is often found in association with other woodland flora, contributing to the ecological diversity of forest understories."
