    "intro": "Castilleja elata, commonly known as the tall yellow milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate and pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Castilleja elata is often found in open grasslands and sagebrush habitats, thriving in well-drained soils."
