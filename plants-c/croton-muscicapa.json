    "intro": "Croton muscicapa, commonly known as the velvetleaf croton, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that are typically a deep green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Croton muscicapa is often grown as an ornamental plant for its striking foliage rather than its flowers. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and requires well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight."
