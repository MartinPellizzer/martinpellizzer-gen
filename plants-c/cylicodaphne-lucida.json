    "intro": "Cylicodaphne lucida, commonly known as the bright cycad, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often a striking green color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, cone-like structures that contain its seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in botanical gardens and private collections."
