    "intro": "Cardamine acuminata, commonly known as the acuminated watercress, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pinnately lobed leaves and delicate, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor similar to that of watercress. It plays a role in supporting local insect populations and is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
