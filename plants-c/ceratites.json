    "intro": "Ceratites, commonly known as the horned fern, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic ferns belonging to the family Marsileaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, spirally arranged, four-leaf clover-like fronds that float on the water's surface. Ceratites species typically have small, delicate leaves with a waxy coating that helps them remain buoyant. They are native to temperate and tropical regions, often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant's unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
