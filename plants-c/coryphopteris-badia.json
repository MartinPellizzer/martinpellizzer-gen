    "intro": "Coryphopteris badia, commonly known as the black fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, fronds that are glossy and leathery in texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of its fronds. Coryphopteris badia is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
