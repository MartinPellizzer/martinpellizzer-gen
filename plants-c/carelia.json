    "intro": "Carelia, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a halophytic shrub that thrives in coastal environments. It has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline conditions. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fleshy, red berries. Its roots form a dense network that stabilizes shorelines and prevents erosion. Carelia is an important species in mangrove ecosystems, providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
