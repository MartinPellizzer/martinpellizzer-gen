    "intro": "Calamagrostis sylvatica var. pyramidalis, commonly known as the narrowleaf tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and dense, pyramidal-shaped clumps of foliage. The plant produces tall, slender panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow, flat, and often have a slight blue-green hue, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its elegant appearance and ability to form cohesive, low-maintenance plantings."
