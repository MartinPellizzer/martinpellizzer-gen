    "intro": "Cattleya trianae var. marginata, commonly known as the Margined Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid prized for its vibrant and showy flowers. It features large, fragrant blooms with a distinctive white and pink coloration, often marked by a striking margin that sets it apart from other varieties. Native to the tropical regions of South America, this plant thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light. It is a sympodial orchid, meaning it grows in a horizontal rhizome system, producing new shoots from the base. The plant requires well-draining soil and consistent moisture to flourish, making it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
