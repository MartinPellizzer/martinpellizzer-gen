    "intro": "Campanula scheuchzeri var. heterodoxa, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces bell-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. This variety is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates."
