    "intro": "Cymbidium gomphocarpum, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing numerous fragrant, showy flowers. The plant typically blooms in late winter to early spring, with flowers ranging in color from white to pale yellow and sometimes with a slight pink or red tint. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Cymbidium gomphocarpum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
