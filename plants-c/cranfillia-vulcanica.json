    "intro": "Cranfillia vulcanica, commonly known as the volcanic orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the volcanic regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in nutrient-rich, acidic soils found in volcanic ash and lava deposits. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive, tubular shape that attracts specific pollinators. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its harsh, high-altitude environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cranfillia vulcanica is considered a vulnerable species."
