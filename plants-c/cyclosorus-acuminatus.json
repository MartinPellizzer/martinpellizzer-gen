    "intro": "Cyclosorus acuminatus, commonly known as the slender water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its four-leaf clover-like structure, which is often submerged in freshwater environments. The plant has delicate, floating leaves that are usually less than 1 inch in diameter, with a waxy surface that helps it float. It reproduces through spores and is often found in still or slow-moving water bodies. Cyclosorus acuminatus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
