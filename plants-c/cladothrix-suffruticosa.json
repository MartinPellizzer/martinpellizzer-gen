    "intro": "Cladothrix suffruticosa, commonly known as the rockrose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody, shrub-like stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or coastal environments. Its leaves are typically small, linear, and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Cladothrix suffruticosa is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
