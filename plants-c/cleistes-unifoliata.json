    "intro": "Cleistes unifoliata, commonly known as the single-leaved cleistocarp, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on its host for nutrients while also performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are typically hidden within its leaves, a feature that aids in pollination by attracting specific insects. Its leaves are simple and often arranged in a rosette, and the plant has a short, annual life cycle. Cleistes unifoliata is characterized by its unique morphology and ecological interactions, making it an interesting subject for botanical study."
