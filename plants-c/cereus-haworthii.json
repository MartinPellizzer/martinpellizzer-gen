    "intro": "Cereus haworthii, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive red or orange stems, which are actually a different species grafted onto the main plant. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers during the night, which is a unique adaptation to attract nocturnal pollinators. It is a slow-growing, low-maintenance cactus that thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and rockeries."
