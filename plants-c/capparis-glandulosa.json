    "intro": "Capparis glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular caper, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and pinnate leaves with small, glandular hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds. Capparis glandulosa is adapted to grow in rocky, coastal environments and is often found in dry, sunny habitats."
