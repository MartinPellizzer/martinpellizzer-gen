    "intro": "Carpinus luochengensis, commonly known as the Luocheng hornbeam, is a rare deciduous tree native to China. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and smooth, gray bark. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
