    "intro": "Calamintha orontia, commonly known as caraway or wild caraway, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, aromatic stems that are often branched and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a strong, pungent aroma reminiscent of caraway. The seeds, which are small and dry, are used in culinary and medicinal applications due to their aromatic properties."
