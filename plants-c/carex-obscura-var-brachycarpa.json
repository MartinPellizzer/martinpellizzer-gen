It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown, and it is often found in wet or moist environments such as marshes and wetlands. Its compact, dark brown to black fruiting bodies are distinctive and contribute to its identification."
