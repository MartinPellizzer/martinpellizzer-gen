    "intro": "Costus congestiflorus var. glabrior, commonly known as the woolly costus, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust rhizomatous growth and striking, showy inflorescences that resemble spikes of small, tubular flowers. The leaves are typically broad, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy texture. This variant is distinguished by its reduced pubescence compared to the typical form, giving it a smoother appearance. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in warm climates due to its vibrant floral display."
