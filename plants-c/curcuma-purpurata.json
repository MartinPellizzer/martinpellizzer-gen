    "intro": "Curcuma purpurata, commonly known as the purple ginger, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes other gingers and turmeric. The plant is characterized by its ornamental, tubular, and violet-colored flowers that bloom in clusters. Its rhizomes, while not as widely used in culinary applications as turmeric, have been explored for their potential medicinal properties. Curcuma purpurata is often cultivated for its striking floral display and is a popular choice in tropical gardens."
