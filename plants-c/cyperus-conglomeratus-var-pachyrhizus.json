    "intro": "Cyperus conglomeratus var. pachyrhizus, commonly known as the broad-rooted flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that are often inconspicuous. Its roots are notably thick and robust, which helps it thrive in waterlogged soils. This variant is distinguished by its broader root system compared to other Cyperus species."
