    "intro": "Clematis spathulifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf clematis, is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, often with a waxy texture and a distinctive, somewhat heart-shaped leaf blade. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of white, pink, or blue. It thrives in partial to full sun and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Clematis spathulifolia is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to climb trellises or structures."
