    "intro": "Casiostega humilis, commonly known as the dwarf casia, is a small shrub native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Leguminosae family, which is characterized by its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Casiostega humilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
