    "intro": "Combretum nigrescens, commonly known as blackwood or African blackwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its dark, often glossy bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by elongated, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically used in traditional crafts and as a source of timber."
