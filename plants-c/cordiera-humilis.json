    "intro": "Cordiera humilis, commonly known as the dwarf cordiera, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers during the winter months, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Cordiera humilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
