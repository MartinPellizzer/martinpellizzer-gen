    "intro": "Carex panicea var. gynobasica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, temperate regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and slightly curled at the tips. Its flowering stems produce small, clustered spikes of pale to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity in wetland ecosystems."
