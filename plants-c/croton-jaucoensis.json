    "intro": "Croton jaucoensis, commonly known as the Jauco croton, is a shrub native to the Caribbean, particularly found in parts of Cuba and the Bahamas. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is characterized by its diverse morphology and often milky sap. The plant typically features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruit is a three-lobed capsule containing seeds. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
