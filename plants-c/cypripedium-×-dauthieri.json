    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 dauthieri, commonly known as the Dauthier's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid that exhibits a blend of characteristics from its parent species, Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium pubescens. It is a terrestrial orchid with a tall, erect stem that bears a single, showy, slipper-shaped flower. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and mountainous regions. Its flowers are often pink or purple, with a distinctive pouch-like lip that aids in pollination by insects. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
