    "intro": "Crassula atropurpurea var. atropurpurea, commonly known as the Forest Flame or Red Crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact, upright growth with dense clusters of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically red or purple in color, especially when exposed to bright light. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
