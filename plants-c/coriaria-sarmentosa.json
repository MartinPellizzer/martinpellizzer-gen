    "intro": "Coriaria sarmentosa, commonly known as creeping coriander, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has thin, wiry stems that trail along the ground, giving it a creeping habit. Its leaves are elliptical and slightly hairy, with a fragrant, peppery scent when crushed. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature."
