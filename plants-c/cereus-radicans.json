    "intro": "Cereus radicans, commonly known as the trailing cactus, is a species native to South America. It is a succulent plant characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that grow horizontally along the ground. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to small spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Cereus radicans is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
