    "intro": "Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus subsp. stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf goldenbush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, yellowish-green foliage and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has glandular hairs that give it a sticky texture, and its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
