    "intro": "Coffea capitata, commonly known as the African coffee or the mountain coffee, is a small evergreen shrub native to the highlands of Ethiopia and parts of East Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces red, fleshy fruits called berries, each containing two seeds used for coffee production. It thrives in cool, humid climates with well-drained soil and requires partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique flavor profile, it is a valuable species in specialty coffee cultivation."
