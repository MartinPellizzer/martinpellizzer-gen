    "intro": "Citrus gaoganensis, commonly known as the Guangdong citrus or Gaoguan citrus, is a species native to southern China. It is a small evergreen tree that typically grows to a height of 3\u20135 meters. The plant produces fragrant, yellow-orange fruits that are similar in appearance to other citrus fruits but have a unique flavor profile. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and oval-shaped with a slightly serrated edge. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has limited commercial use in the citrus industry."
