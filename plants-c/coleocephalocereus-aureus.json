    "intro": "Coleocephalocereus aureus, commonly known as the golden candelabra cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that branch out into a tree-like structure, forming a distinctive candelabra shape. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. Its thick, ribbed stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The species is popular among cactus enthusiasts for its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
