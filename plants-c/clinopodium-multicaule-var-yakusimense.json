    "intro": "Clinopodium multicaule var. yakusimense, commonly known as Yakusim wild thyme, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and small, aromatic leaves that are often used in traditional herbal practices. The plant produces tiny blue or purple flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, humid climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
