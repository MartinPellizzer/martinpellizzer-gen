    "intro": "Cystopteris vestita, commonly known as the naked fern, is a species of polypodiaceae that is native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in tiny, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Cystopteris vestita is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
