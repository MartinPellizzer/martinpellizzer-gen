    "intro": "Ctenodon petraeus, commonly known as the rock ctenodon, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, adapted for pollination by insects. Its root system is extensive, enabling it to access deep underground water sources. Ctenodon petraeus is often found growing on rocky outcrops, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils."
