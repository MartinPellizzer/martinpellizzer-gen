    "intro": "Corylus spicata, commonly known as the spiked hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Betulaceae and is characterized by its slender, spire-like arrangement of female flowers. The plant produces edible nuts enclosed in a spiky husk, which mature in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated margins, turning yellow in the fall. Corylus spicata is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive form and seasonal interest."
