    "intro": "Coristospermum lucidum subsp. seguieri, commonly known as the Seguier's coristosperm, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree with woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it relies on wind pollination. Its seeds are encased in hard, dry pods that open to release the seeds, a common adaptation in desert environments. This species is well adapted to drought and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
