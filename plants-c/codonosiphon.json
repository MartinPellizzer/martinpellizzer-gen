    "intro": "Codonosiphon, commonly known as the common morning glory, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Convolvulaceae. These plants are characterized by their trumpet-shaped flowers, which typically open in the morning and close in the evening. They are native to various regions in the Americas and are often found in moist, sunny environments. Codonosiphon species are climbing plants with tendrils that help them ascend supports. Their leaves are usually heart-shaped and their seeds are enclosed in rough, spherical capsules."
