    "intro": "Cerastium brachypetalum var. eriocaulon, commonly known as the woolly mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, hairy leaves and pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its compact form and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
