    "intro": "Clitoria sagotii, commonly known as the blue pea or sacred bean, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a climbing legume characterized by its striking violet to blue flowers, which are often used in traditional medicine and as a natural dye. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain seeds, and its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets. Clitoria sagotii thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and full sunlight. It is also valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological benefits, such as nitrogen fixation in the soil."
