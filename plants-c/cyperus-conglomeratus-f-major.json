    "intro": "Cyperus conglomeratus f. major, commonly known as the giant flatsedge, is a variant of the Cyperus genus native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a perennial grass-like plant characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical features make it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
