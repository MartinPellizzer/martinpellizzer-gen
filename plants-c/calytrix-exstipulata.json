    "intro": "Calytrix exstipulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. The plant features small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Calytrix exstipulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowering display."
