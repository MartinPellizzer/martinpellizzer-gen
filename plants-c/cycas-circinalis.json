    "intro": "Cycas circinalis, commonly known as the \"Coral tree cycad,\" is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like leaves that are spirally arranged and can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental foliage in horticulture. Cycas circinalis is also valued for its slow growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
