    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum viscidum, commonly known as the sticky petal orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring long, curling petals that resemble tendrils, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season, often in dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cirrhopetalum viscidum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
