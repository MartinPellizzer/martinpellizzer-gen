    "intro": "Cochemiea estebanensis, commonly known as the Esteban's cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically green to blue-gray in color, covered with clusters of small, spine-tipped tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer, which are often followed by small, spiny fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Cochemiea estebanensis is a slow-growing plant that is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance."
