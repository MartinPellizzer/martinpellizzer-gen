It is a shrub-like species that can grow up to 2 meters tall, characterized by its woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking blue to purple flower heads that are composed of many small florets arranged in a composite flower structure. Its botanical features include a taproot system and the ability to thrive in well-drained soils.
