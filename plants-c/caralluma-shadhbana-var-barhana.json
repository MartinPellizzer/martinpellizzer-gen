    "intro": "Caralluma shadhbana var. barhana, commonly known as the Indian date tree or desert date, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of India. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by orange or red fruits that contain edible seeds. Its leaves are typically small and scale-like, reducing water loss through transpiration. Due to its drought tolerance and medicinal properties, it is often used in traditional Ayurvedic practices."
