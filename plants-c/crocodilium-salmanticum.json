    "intro": "Crocodilium salmanticum, commonly known as the Salmanticum crocodile plant, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, reptile-like appearance, with thick, waxy leaves that resemble the scales of a crocodile. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
