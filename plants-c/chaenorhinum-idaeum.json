    "intro": "Chaenorhinum idaeum, commonly known as the Idaean horned poppy, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange flowers with prominent, horn-like bracts that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in sunny conditions. Its slender, branching stems are often covered in fine hairs, and the leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly hairy surface. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing showy flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
