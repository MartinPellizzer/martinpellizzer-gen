It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a reddish or purple hue, especially under bright light. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves to survive drought conditions. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections."
