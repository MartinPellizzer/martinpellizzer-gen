    "intro": "Coffea zenkeri, commonly known as the Zenker's coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly Kenya and Tanzania. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds used for coffee production. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and compact growth habit. Due to its unique flavor profile, it is considered a specialty coffee bean, though it is less commonly cultivated than other coffee species."
