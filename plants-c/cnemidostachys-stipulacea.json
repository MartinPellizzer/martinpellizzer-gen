    "intro": "Cnemidostachys stipulacea, commonly known as the velvetleaf bamboo, is a member of the grass family (Poaceae). It is characterized by its dense, clump-forming growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas."
