    "intro": "Cyrtopera paradoxa, commonly known as the paradoxical cyrtopera, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
