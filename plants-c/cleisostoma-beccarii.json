    "intro": "Cleisostoma beccarii, commonly known as the Beccari's cleistostoma, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Cleisostoma beccarii is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. Its flowers are often short-lived but attract various pollinators due to their scent and color."
