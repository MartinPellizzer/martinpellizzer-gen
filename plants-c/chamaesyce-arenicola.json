    "intro": "Chamaesyce arenicola, commonly known as sand spurge, is a low-growing annual plant native to sandy and coastal environments. It has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a common weed in disturbed areas."
