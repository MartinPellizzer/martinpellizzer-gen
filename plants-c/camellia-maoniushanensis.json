    "intro": "Camellia maoniushanensis, commonly known as the Maoniushan camellia, is a rare and ornamental evergreen shrub native to China. It belongs to the Theaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming in winter or early spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
