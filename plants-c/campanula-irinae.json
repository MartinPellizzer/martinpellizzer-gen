    "intro": "Campanula irinae, commonly known as the Irina bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters, with lanceolate leaves that are hairy and gray-green in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Campanula irinae is considered a rare and endangered species."
