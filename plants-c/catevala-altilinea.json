    "intro": "Catevala altilinea, commonly known as the slender cat's eye, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is characterized by its unique, elongated flower shape. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of a cat's eye. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Catevala altilinea is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
