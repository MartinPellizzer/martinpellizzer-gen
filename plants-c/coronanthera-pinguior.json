    "intro": "Coronanthera pinguior, commonly known as the fat-leaf orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the dry season. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
