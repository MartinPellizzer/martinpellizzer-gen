    "intro": "Campanula lehmanniana subsp. integerrima, commonly known as the Lehmann's bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The subspecies integerrima is distinguished by its more robust stems and broader leaves compared to other members of the species. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
