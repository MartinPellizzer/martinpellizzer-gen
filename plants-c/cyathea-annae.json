    "intro": "Cyathea annae, commonly known as the Annas' tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, trunk-like stem and large, feathery fronds. The plant exhibits a unique growth pattern, with the trunk forming from the base of the plant and the fronds emerging from the crown. Cyathea annae is often found in humid, shaded environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives in the undergrowth. Its slow growth and long lifespan make it a significant component of the ecological structure in its native habitats."
