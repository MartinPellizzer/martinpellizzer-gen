    "intro": "Cypholophus macrocephalus var. heterophyllus, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant has a distinctive spongy, air-filled stem that helps it remain buoyant. Its flowers are showy, with white petals and a yellow center, blooming in the early morning. This variant is notable for its morphological variation, particularly in leaf shape and size, which can differ depending on environmental conditions."
