    "intro": "Calyptranthes litoralis, commonly known as the coastal calyptranthes, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and periodic inundation. The plant has small, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture and a glossy surface. Its flowers are white to pale yellow, clustered in small umbels, and bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sand dunes and tolerate harsh maritime conditions."
