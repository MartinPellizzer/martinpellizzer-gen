    "intro": "Cyperus thyrsiflorus, commonly known as the spikeflower flatsedge, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can influence local biodiversity. Cyperus thyrsiflorus is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures for its purported health benefits."
