    "intro": "Collomia debilis var. typica, commonly known as the slender collomia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family, characterized by its hairy stems and showy blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
