    "intro": "Calandrinia skottsbergii, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of South America. It is a low-growing annual herb with succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in the early morning. Its adaptations include deep root systems and the ability to store water in its tissues, making it well-suited for desert conditions. Calandrinia skottsbergii is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
