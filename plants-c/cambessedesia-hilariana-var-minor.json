It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and yellowish-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
