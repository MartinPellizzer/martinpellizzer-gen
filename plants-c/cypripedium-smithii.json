    "intro": "Cypripedium smithii, commonly known as Smith's lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats, often in association with coniferous trees. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and it produces a single flower per stem, which blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many areas, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
