    "intro": "Cuscuta popayanensis, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves germinating on the surface of its host before developing a network of haustoria to penetrate the host's tissues. The plant is native to South America and is often found growing on various wild plants, including grasses and shrubs. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host, making it an invasive species in some regions."
