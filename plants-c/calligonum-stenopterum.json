    "intro": "Calligonum stenopterum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. It is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive drought conditions. Calligonum stenopterum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soils."
