    "intro": "Cymbalaria pubescens, commonly known as the hairy figwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular, pink to purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Cymbalaria pubescens is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodland floors and along stream banks."
