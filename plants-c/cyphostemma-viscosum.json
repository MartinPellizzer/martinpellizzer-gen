    "intro": "Cyphostemma viscosum, commonly known as the sticky cyphostemma, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that exude a sticky sap when damaged. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by orange-red fruits containing elliptical seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky outcrops or in dry woodlands. Due to its unique appearance and ecological adaptations, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
