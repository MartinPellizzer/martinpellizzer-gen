It is a shrub native to the arid regions of central Asia, characterized by its spiny, thorned stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by elongated, woody pods that contain several seeds. It is drought-tolerant and adapted to poor soil conditions, making it a hardy species for semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important plant for ecological restoration in degraded landscapes."
