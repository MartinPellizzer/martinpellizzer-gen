    "intro": "Cystodium, commonly known as the bladder fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cystodiaceae. It is characterized by its unique, inflated, bladder-like structures that house spores. These structures are typically found on the underside of the leaves, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. Cystodium species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
