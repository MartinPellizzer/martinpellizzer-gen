    "intro": "Crepidium repens, commonly known as the running pteridium, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its slender, rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread across the ground in dense mats. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often forming a dense, low-growing cover. Crepidium repens is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
