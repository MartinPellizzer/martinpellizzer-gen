    "intro": "Calandrinia dielsii, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the family Portulacaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves, which help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the morning and close by midday, adapting to the heat of the day. Its flowers are typically pink to purple in color, and it blooms from spring to early summer. Calandrinia dielsii is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions."
