    "intro": "Cyclostemon glaber, commonly known as the smooth cyclostemon, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a woody stem with smooth, grayish bark that becomes fissured with age. Its leaves are simple, elliptical, and have a leathery texture, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. Cyclostemon glaber is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
