    "intro": "Conium moschatum, commonly known as hemlock, is a toxic herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features slender, hollow stems that are often mistaken for bamboo, and its leaves are finely divided, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. It is particularly dangerous due to the presence of poisonings, such as coniine, which can be lethal even in small doses. Despite its toxicity, it has been historically used in medicine and as a poison."
