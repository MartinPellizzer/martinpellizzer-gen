    "intro": "Cardamomum citratum, commonly known as citrate cardamom, is a tropical plant belonging to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae). It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces aromatic, finger-like spikes of small, white flowers that eventually develop into dark brown, three-lobed berries. The berries contain aromatic seeds used in culinary and medicinal applications. Its essential oil, rich in compounds like cineole and limonene, contributes to its distinctive fragrance and therapeutic properties."
