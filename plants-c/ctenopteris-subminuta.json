    "intro": "Ctenopteris subminuta, commonly known as the dwarf chain fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in specialized structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Ctenopteris subminuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
