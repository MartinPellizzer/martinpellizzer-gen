    "intro": "Ctenopteris knightii, commonly known as the Knight's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into narrow, feather-like segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, contributing to water filtration and habitat creation for small aquatic organisms. Ctenopteris knightii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to improve water quality in artificial ponds."
