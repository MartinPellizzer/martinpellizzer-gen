    "intro": "Clitandra robustior, commonly known as the robust tree or forest tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and dense canopy of elliptical, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its hard, durable wood. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
