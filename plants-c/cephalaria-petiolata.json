    "intro": "Cephalaria petiolata, commonly known as the leafy bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and tall, branching stems that bear clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers. The flowers are typically blue to purple in color and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees and butterflies. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
