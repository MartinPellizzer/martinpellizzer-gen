    "intro": "Casuarina humilis, commonly known as the slender she-oak, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to eastern Australia. It has needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals around the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is often found in dune environments. Casuarina humilis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for native wildlife."
