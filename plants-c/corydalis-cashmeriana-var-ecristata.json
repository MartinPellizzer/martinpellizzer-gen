    "intro": "Corydalis cashmeriana var. ecristata, commonly known as the Himalayan crested larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
