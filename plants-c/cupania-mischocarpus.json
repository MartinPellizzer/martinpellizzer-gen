    "intro": "Cupania mischocarpus, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a woody shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often arranged in opposite pairs, and its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink in color. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various bird species. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
