    "intro": "Clematis gracilifolia var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the silky-haired clematis, is a climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features slender, twining stems that can reach lengths of up to 10 meters. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with finely serrated edges and a soft, hairy texture. The variety is distinguished by its dense, silky pubescence, particularly on the stems and young leaves."
