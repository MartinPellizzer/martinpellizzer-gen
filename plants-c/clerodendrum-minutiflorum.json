It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often blooming in the summer months. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Clerodendrum minutiflorum is often found in moist, shady areas and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
