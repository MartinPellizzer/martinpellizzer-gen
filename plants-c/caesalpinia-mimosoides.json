    "intro": "Caesalpinia mimosoides, commonly known as the yellow mimosa, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which resemble those of the mimosoid legumes, and its showy, yellow-orange flower clusters. The plant produces elongated, woody pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Caesalpinia mimosoides is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
