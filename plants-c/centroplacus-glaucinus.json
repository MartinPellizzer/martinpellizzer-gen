It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive appearance."
