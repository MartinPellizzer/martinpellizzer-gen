    "intro": "Colchicum parvulum, commonly known as the dwarf autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It produces striking violet-blue flowers in the fall, typically from September to November. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous corm, which is its primary storage organ. Its flowers are borne on short, erect stems and are often mistaken for true crocuses. Colchicum parvulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique blooming season."
