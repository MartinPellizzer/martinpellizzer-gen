    "intro": "Craterostemma, commonly known as the \"flower of the desert,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Solanaceae, which includes nightshades. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, particularly in southern and eastern parts of the continent. They are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. The plants typically have hairy stems and leaves, and their flowers are usually tubular with five lobes. Craterostemma species are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often storing water in their thick, fleshy leaves and stems."
