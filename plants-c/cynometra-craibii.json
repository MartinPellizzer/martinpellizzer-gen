It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has compound leaves with elliptical leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in panicles. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
