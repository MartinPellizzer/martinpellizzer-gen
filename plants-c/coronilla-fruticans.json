    "intro": "Coronilla fruticans, commonly known as the desert clover, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean, North Africa, and the Middle East. It is a perennial herb with a creeping growth habit, featuring small, spiny stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It has adapted to survive in harsh environments through deep root systems and drought tolerance. Its fibrous stems and leaves are often used in traditional medicine and for erosion control in degraded soils."
