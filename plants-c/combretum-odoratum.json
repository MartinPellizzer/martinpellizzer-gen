    "intro": "Combretum odoratum, commonly known as the fragrant combretum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its aromatic properties, it has been used in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic compounds."
