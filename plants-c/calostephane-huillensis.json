    "intro": "Calostephane huillensis, commonly known as the Huill\u00e9n calostephane, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as rocky slopes and mountainous regions, where it adapts to harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a finely hairy surface, while its flowers are small and white, clustered in umbrella-like arrangements. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calostephane huillensis is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of interest for conservation studies."
