    "intro": "Curcuma neilgherrensis, commonly known as the Nilgiri turmeric, is a rhizomatous herb native to the mountainous regions of southern India and Nepal. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, yellow-orange rhizomes. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Its flowers are borne in inflorescences and are typically yellow or orange, with a distinctive, fragrant aroma. The rhizomes are used in traditional medicine and are similar in appearance and some uses to common turmeric (Curcuma longa)."
