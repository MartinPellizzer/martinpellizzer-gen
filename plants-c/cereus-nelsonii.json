    "intro": "Cereus nelsonii, commonly known as the Nelson's cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, a feature common in many cactus species. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in arid environments with minimal water. Cereus nelsonii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and resilience."
