    "intro": "Cirsium chamaepeuce f. pseudofruticosus, commonly known as the creeping thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flower heads. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is native to parts of Europe and western Asia. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought. Its flowers are visited by various pollinators, including bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance. The subspecies is distinguished by its more sprawling growth habit compared to other thistle varieties."
