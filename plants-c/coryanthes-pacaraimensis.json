    "intro": "Coryanthes pacaraimensis, commonly known as the Pacaraima orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family found in the rainforests of South America. This plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in height, featuring a distinctive lip that is often brightly colored. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom, including high humidity and well-drained soil. The plant's unique structure and pollination mechanism make it an important subject in botanical studies. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
