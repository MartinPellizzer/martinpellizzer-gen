    "intro": "Calanthe cremeoviridis, commonly known as the Creamy Green Calanthe, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and its striking, pale green to cream-colored flowers with a subtle yellowish tint. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with three sepals and three petals, and it blooms during the spring or early summer. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, Calanthe cremeoviridis is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
