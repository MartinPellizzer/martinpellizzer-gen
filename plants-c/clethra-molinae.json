    "intro": "Clethra molinae, commonly known as the Molina's sweet pepperbush, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Clethra molinae thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
