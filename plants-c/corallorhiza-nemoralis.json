    "intro": "Corallorhiza nemoralis, commonly known as the common coralroot, is an epiparasitic orchid that lacks chlorophyll and relies on other plants for its nutrients. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in woodlands and heathlands. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a spike, and its roots are specialized to attach to the roots of host plants. It plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing the nutrient dynamics of its environment. Due to its parasitic nature, it is not typically cultivated in gardens."
