    "intro": "Coreopsis rhyacophila, commonly known as the water coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along streambanks and wetlands, making it well adapted to wetland environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are composed of ray florets surrounding a central disk. Coreopsis rhyacophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
