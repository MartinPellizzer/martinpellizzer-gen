    "intro": "Cenchrus pauper, commonly known as poor grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny grains. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soils, making it a common component of dryland vegetation. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cenchrus pauper is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock in certain regions."
