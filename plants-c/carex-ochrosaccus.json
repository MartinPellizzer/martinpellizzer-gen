    "intro": "Carex ochrosaccus, commonly known as the white-sheath sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically found in clusters at the ends of its stems. Carex ochrosaccus thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitats."
