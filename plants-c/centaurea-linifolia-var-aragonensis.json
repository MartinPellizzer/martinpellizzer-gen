It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, achene-like seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as steppes and coastal areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
