    "intro": "Cistus ferrugineus, commonly known as the rusty rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces distinctive, urn-shaped capsules that contain numerous small, dark seeds. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to rocky or coastal environments. The leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions."
