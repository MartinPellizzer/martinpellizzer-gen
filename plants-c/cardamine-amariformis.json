    "intro": "Cardamine amariformis, commonly known as the bitter watercress, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. Native to parts of Europe and western Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant has a distinctive bitter taste due to the presence of glucosinolates and other secondary metabolites. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and phytochemical studies."
