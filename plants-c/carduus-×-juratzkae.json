    "intro": "Carduus \u00d7 juratzkae, commonly known as the Juratzkae thistle, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Carduus benedictus and Carduus marianus. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and a striking purple to pink flower head that blooms in late summer. The plant is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, where it often grows in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It has a rosette growth form with a tall, cylindrical stem that supports its composite flower head. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
