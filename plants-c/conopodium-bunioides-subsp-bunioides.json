    "intro": "Conopodium bunioides subsp. bunioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. The plant features slender, upright stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early summer. The species is characterized by its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
