    "intro": "Cerasus padus var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping cherry or weeping almond, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its cascading branches that create a distinctive, elegant appearance, especially when covered with pink or white blossoms in spring. The plant produces small, edible fruits that ripen in late summer, though they are not typically consumed by humans. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its delicate beauty and seasonal flowering make it a favorite in landscaping and horticultural settings."
