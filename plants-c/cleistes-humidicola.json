    "intro": "Cleistes humidicola, commonly known as the swamp monkeyflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in Central and South America. It features showy, pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of its stems. The plant has heart-shaped, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its moist, often swampy environment. It is adapted to thrive in poorly drained soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Cleistes humidicola plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly bees and flies, due to its nectar-rich blooms."
