    "intro": "Cynara communis, commonly known as artichoke, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its large, spiny leaves and purple flower heads. The plant produces a globular inflorescence that consists of many small florets, which are the true flowers. The edible part of the plant is the immature flower head, which is harvested before the florets open. Cynara communis is cultivated for its nutritional value and is also used in traditional medicine."
