    "intro": "Crocus cambessedesii, commonly known as the Corsican crocus, is a species of flowering plant in the Iridaceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean region, specifically Corsica and Sardinia, where it thrives in rocky and coastal environments. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive, narrow shape, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
