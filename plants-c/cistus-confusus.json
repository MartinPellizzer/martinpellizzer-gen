It is native to the Iberian Peninsula and parts of southern France, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and covered in a fine, white pubescence. Cistus confusus is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
