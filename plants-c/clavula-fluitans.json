    "intro": "Clavula fluitans, commonly known as the floating clubmoss, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, branching structure that allows it to float on the surface of water. It belongs to the family Lepidoziaceae and is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. The plant's leaves are small, scale-like, and arranged in whorls around the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Clavula fluitans is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
