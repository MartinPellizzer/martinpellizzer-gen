It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in grassland and rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, spiky inflorescence that resembles a cat's tail, composed of dense clusters of small yellow flowers. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces a unique, hairy stem that adds to its ornamental appeal. Chaetogastra ornata is often cultivated for its striking appearance and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates."
