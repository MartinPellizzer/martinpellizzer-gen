    "intro": "Cadamba nocturna, commonly known as night-flowering jasmine, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually ovate or elliptic in shape. Its flowers are typically clustered in terminal panicles, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits. Cadamba nocturna is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional medicine."
