    "intro": "Crataegus wisconsinensis, commonly known as the Wisconsin hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the central United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 feet and features thorned branches, which are a distinctive botanical characteristic. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by red berries in the fall. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with serrated edges and a smooth upper surface. The Wisconsin hawthorn is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides."
