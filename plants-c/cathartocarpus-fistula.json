    "intro": "Cathartocarpus fistula, commonly known as the yellow brome, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, three-lobed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, meadows, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
