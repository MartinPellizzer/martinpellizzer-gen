    "intro": "Carex purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-fringed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Carex purpurascens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its striking purple-tinged foliage, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
