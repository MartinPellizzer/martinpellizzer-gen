    "intro": "Celmisia sinclairii, commonly known as the silverweed, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its silver-hairy foliage and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in damp, shaded areas such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Celmisia sinclairii is often found in the South Island and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance."
