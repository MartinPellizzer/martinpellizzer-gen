It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences with white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden settings. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in native plant gardens and conservation areas."
