It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces fruits that are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by animals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and desert gardens."
