    "intro": "Castilleja cinerea, commonly known as the pale Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has modified stems that perform photosynthesis. It attaches to the roots of other plants, drawing water and nutrients, which makes it a facultative parasite. Castilleja cinerea is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe."
