    "intro": "Callista aurorosea, commonly known as the aurora bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a faintly veined pattern. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps to reflect sunlight. Callista aurorosea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
