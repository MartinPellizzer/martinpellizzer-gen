    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia f. subverruculosa, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped blue to violet flowers. It features rounded, hairy leaves that give it a soft, fuzzy appearance, and its stems are often covered with a fine, woolly coating. This subspecies is native to Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, bell-like blooms. Its botanical features make it well adapted to cool, humid climates and partially shaded conditions."
