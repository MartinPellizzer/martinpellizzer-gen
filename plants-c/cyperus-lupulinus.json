    "intro": "Cyperus lupulinus, commonly known as the swamp bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the Americas. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated, and its rhizomes help it spread in moist environments. Cyperus lupulinus thrives in shallow water or saturated soil, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate both freshwater and brackish conditions contributes to its ecological versatility."
