    "intro": "Callitriche intermedia var. pedunculata, commonly known as the aquatic starwort, is a herbaceous aquatic plant characterized by its small, star-shaped leaves and delicate flowers. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has whorled leaves that are often floating or submersed, and its flowers are usually white or pale pink, appearing in clusters. It is a member of the Haloragaceae family and is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize wetlands. This variant is distinguished by its elongated peduncles, which support its flowering stems above the water surface."
