    "intro": "Cynosurus gracilis, commonly known as slender hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, woodlands, and along streambanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, which are small, clustered flower clusters. Cynosurus gracilis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and small mammals."
