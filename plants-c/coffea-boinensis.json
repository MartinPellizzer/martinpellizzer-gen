    "intro": "Coffea boinensis, commonly known as the Bornean coffee, is a species native to the island of Borneo. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows in the understory of tropical rainforests. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the seeds used for coffee production. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and has a relatively low caffeine content compared to other coffee species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant."
