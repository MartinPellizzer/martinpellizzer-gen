    "intro": "Calypso bulbosa f. nivea, commonly known as the white-flowered Dutchman's pipe, is a striking member of the Aristolochiaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, tubular, white flowers that resemble a pipe, which are often covered in a dense, velvety bloom. The plant produces a distinctive, fragrant scent that attracts pollinators such as flies and moths. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a smooth, glossy texture. Native to the southeastern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
