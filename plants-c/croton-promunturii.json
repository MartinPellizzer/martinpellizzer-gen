    "intro": "Croton promunturii, commonly known as the coastal croton, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often blue-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a valuable addition to xeriscapes and coastal landscapes."
