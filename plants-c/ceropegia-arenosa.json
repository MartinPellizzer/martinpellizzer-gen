    "intro": "Ceropegia arenosa, commonly known as the sand ceropegia, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing stems and small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces delicate, tubular flowers that are often pale green or yellowish in color. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
