    "intro": "Chomelia leioloba, commonly known as the smooth chomelia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 12,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often glabrous or nearly hairless. Its flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, with white or pale yellow petals. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature, contributing to its dispersal in the wild."
