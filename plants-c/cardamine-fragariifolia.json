It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its leaves are often covered in fine, glandular hairs that give it a peppery scent. The fruit is a cluster of small, inflated, bladder-like structures that contain seeds."
