    "intro": "Cereus perlucens, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a cactus species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its swollen, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant typically features a vibrant, colorful crown that sits atop a green, chlorophyll-rich base, which is actually a different species grafted onto the main stem. Its flowers are large, white, and often fragrant, blooming at night. Cereus perlucens requires minimal water and well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
