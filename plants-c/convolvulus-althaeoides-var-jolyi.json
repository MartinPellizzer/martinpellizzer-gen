    "intro": "Convolvulus althaeoides var. jolyi, commonly known as the Joly's bindweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial vine characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and invasive tendencies in some regions, it is both cultivated and considered a weed."
