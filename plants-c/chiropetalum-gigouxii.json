It is characterized by its dense, golden-yellow foliage that turns reddish in autumn. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
