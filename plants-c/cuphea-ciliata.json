    "intro": "Cuphea ciliata, commonly known as the velvetleaf cuphea, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to pink. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds due to their nectar-rich structure. Cuphea ciliata is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in full sun to partial shade."
