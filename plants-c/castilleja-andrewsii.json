    "intro": "Castilleja andrewsii, commonly known as Andrews' Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange flower spikes that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on neighboring plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and meadows. Due to its ecological role and limited distribution, it is often of conservation interest."
