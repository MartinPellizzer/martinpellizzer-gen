    "intro": "Cliocarpus megalochiton, commonly known as the giant sea almond, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, woody structure and thick, leathery leaves. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by water. Cliocarpus megalochiton is often found in mangrove and brackish water environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
