    "intro": "Canacomyrica monticola, commonly known as the mountain canary myrica, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, which are followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in mountainous forest habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
