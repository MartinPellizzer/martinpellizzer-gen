    "intro": "Carex eboracensis, commonly known as the York shrewsbury sedge, is a species of sedges native to the United Kingdom. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in wet or damp habitats such as marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers in the summer. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in poorly drained soils and its preference for cool, moist environments. Carex eboracensis plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
