    "intro": "Camellia odorata, commonly known as the Chinese camellia, is a flowering plant native to China and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, camellia-like flowers that bloom in winter or early spring. The plant produces waxy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, often with a subtle fragrance. Camellia odorata thrives in partially shaded, moist environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a parent species in the hybridization of many popular camellia varieties."
