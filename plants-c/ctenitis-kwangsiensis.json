    "intro": "Ctenitis kwangsiensis, commonly known as the Guangxi holly fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lobed fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ctenitis kwangsiensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
