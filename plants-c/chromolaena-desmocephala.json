    "intro": "Chromolaena desmocephala, commonly known as croton weed, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by orange or red berries that contain seeds. It thrives in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields due to its rapid growth and adaptability. Its invasive nature makes it a significant concern in ecological management in many regions."
