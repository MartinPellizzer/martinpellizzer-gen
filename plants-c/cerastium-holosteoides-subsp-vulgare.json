    "intro": "Cerastium holosteoides subsp. vulgare, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, spoon-shaped leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its stems are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wildflower gardens."
