    "intro": "Circaea alpina var. pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its small, opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are often clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its broader leaves and slightly different flowering patterns."
