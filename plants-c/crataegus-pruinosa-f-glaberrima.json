    "intro": "Crataegus pruinosa f. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth-hairy hawthorn, is a botanical variant of the common hawthorn. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves, which distinguish it from the typical form of the species. The plant produces small, white flowers in spring, followed by red or yellow berries in the autumn. It is native to parts of North America and thrives in well-drained soils. This cultivar is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
