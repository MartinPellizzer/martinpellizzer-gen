    "intro": "Cephalomanes australicum, commonly known as the Australian sea hare, is a species of marine gastropod mollusk belonging to the family Aplysiidae. It is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body and a distinctive, often brightly colored mantle that can vary in hue depending on the individual and environmental conditions. This species is typically found in shallow coastal waters along the southern coasts of Australia, where it thrives in rocky intertidal zones. Its diet primarily consists of algae and other microscopic organisms, which it filters from the water using its specialized feeding structures. Due to its ecological role in marine ecosystems, Cephalomanes australicum is an important indicator species for the health of coastal environments."
