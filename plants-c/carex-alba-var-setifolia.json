    "intro": "Carex alba var. setifolia, commonly known as the white sedge, is a perennial plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine white bloom, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually green or brown, and it is often used in wetland restoration projects. Carex alba var. setifolia is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality in aquatic habitats."
