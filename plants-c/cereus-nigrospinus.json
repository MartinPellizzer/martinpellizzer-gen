It is a tall, columnar cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring a smooth, dark green stem covered in sharp, black spines. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Cereus nigrospinus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
