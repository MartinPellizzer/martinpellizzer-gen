The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a distinctive coloration that aids in attracting specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited study, the botanical details of this species remain underexplored."
