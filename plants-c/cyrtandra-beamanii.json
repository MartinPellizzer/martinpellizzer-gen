    "intro": "Cyrtandra beamanii, commonly known as the Beaman's cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of red or orange. The plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky crevices. It has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and its growth habit is usually shrub-like. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, Cyrtandra beamanii is considered a vulnerable species."
