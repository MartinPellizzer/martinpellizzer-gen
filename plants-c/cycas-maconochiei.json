    "intro": "Cycas maconochiei, commonly known as the Maconochie's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Cycas maconochiei is adapted to grow in tropical and subtropical climates, often in well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
