    "intro": "Cotopaxia asplundii, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps protect it from the harsh mountain climate. Cotopaxia asplundii is often found in alpine meadows and is a symbol of the unique biodiversity of the Andean ecosystems."
