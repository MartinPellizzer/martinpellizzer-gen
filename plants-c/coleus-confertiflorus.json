    "intro": "Coleus confertiflorus, commonly known as the dense-flowered coleus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy bracts that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically green with contrasting veins. It thrives in warm, humid conditions and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Coleus confertiflorus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its striking foliage and colorful inflorescences."
