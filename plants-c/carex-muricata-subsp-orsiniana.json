    "intro": "Carex muricata subsp. orsiniana, commonly known as the Orsinian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces spikes of small, usually greenish or brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands or along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
