    "intro": "Corylus avellana f. peltata, commonly known as the broadleaf hazel, is a unique cultivar of the hazel tree characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. Its leaves are broader and more rounded compared to the typical hazel, often featuring a serrated margin and a velvety underside. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in gardens due to its attractive foliage and showy catkins. It is typically deciduous, shedding its leaves in autumn, and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The plant is also valued for its edible nuts, though its primary appeal lies in its aesthetic qualities."
