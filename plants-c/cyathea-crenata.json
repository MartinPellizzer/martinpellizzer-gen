    "intro": "Cyathea crenata, commonly known as the serrated tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a distinctive crown of fronds that can reach several meters in length, giving it a lush, tropical appearance. Cyathea crenata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its slow growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and shaded landscapes."
