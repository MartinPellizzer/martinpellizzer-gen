It is characterized by its upright growth habit and its showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces bristly, spiny seed heads that persist into winter, adding structural interest to the garden. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy addition to many landscapes. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for pollinator gardens due to its ability to attract bees and butterflies."
