    "intro": "Ctenitis mannii, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a robust, trunk-like stem covered in a thick, fibrous layer called the rachis. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Ctenitis mannii plays an important ecological role in humid, shaded environments by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
