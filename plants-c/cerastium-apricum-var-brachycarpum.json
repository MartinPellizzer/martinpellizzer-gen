    "intro": "Cerastium apricum var. brachycarpum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, round fruits known as achenes. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine zones. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cooler climates."
