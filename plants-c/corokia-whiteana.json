    "intro": "Corokia whiteana, commonly known as the silver fern, is a striking New Zealand native plant belonging to the fern family. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-green fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a unique appearance. The plant thrives in coastal and forested areas, preferring well-drained soils and mild, temperate climates. Its fronds can grow up to 1.5 meters in length, and it produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures. Corokia whiteana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a symbol of New Zealand's natural heritage."
