    "intro": "Carduus stenocephalus, commonly known as narrow-headed thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Its scientific name reflects its distinctive, narrow flower head, which is a key feature in its botanical classification. The species is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and other thistle species."
