    "intro": "Centaurea chthonocephala, commonly known as the subterranean-headed centaury, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and is adapted to thrive in arid and rocky environments. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Centaurea chthonocephala is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
