    "intro": "Cornus disciflora var. floccosa, commonly known as the woolly dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fluffy, white bracts that resemble clouds, which are actually modified flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red or orange berries that are edible for birds. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and turn a striking red in the fall. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
