    "intro": "Carex cespitosa var. strictiformis, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. The plant forms dense clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, three-stamened flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
