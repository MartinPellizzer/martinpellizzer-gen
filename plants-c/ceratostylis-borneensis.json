    "intro": "Ceratostylis borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean horned-stylis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, elongated leaf. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive, horn-like spur at the base of the labellum. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or among leaf litter. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
