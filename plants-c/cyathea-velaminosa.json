    "intro": "Cyathea velaminosa, commonly known as the velvet tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are typically dark green and have a velvety texture, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. The plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds, typical of ferns."
