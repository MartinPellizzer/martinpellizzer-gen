    "intro": "Ceratozamia, commonly known as the helmet fern, is a genus of cycads native to Mexico and Central America. These plants are characterized by their stout, woody trunks and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps them retain moisture in their native habitats. Ceratozamia species produce cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
