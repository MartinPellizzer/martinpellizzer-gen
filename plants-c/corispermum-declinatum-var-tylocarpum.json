    "intro": "Corispermum declinatum var. tylocarpum, commonly known as the bladder mustard, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are alternate, linear to lanceolate, and often covered in fine hairs. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that releases seeds upon maturity, contributing to its dispersal in harsh environments."
