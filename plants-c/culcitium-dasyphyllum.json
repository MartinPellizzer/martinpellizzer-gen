    "intro": "Culcitium dasyphyllum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils, it is considered an invasive species in some areas."
