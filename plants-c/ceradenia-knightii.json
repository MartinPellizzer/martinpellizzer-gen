It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant prefers high-altitude environments with cool, humid conditions and is often found in cloud forests. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, and it has a short, underground rhizome. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ceradenia knightii is considered a threatened species."
