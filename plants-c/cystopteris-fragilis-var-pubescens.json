    "intro": "Cystopteris fragilis var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy brittle fern, is a variant of the brittle fern characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures. This fern belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a finely divided structure that gives it a lacy appearance. The fronds are usually light green and have a pubescent surface, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
