    "intro": "Chasmanthera, commonly known as the moonflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. These plants are native to various regions in South America, particularly in the Andes. Chasmanthera species are characterized by their large, showy, night-blooming flowers that typically open in the evening and close by dawn. The flowers are usually white or pale in color, with a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor that attracts specific pollinators like moths. The genus includes several species, such as Chasmanthera lanata and Chasmanthera pumila, which are appreciated for their ornamental value and unique blooming habits."
