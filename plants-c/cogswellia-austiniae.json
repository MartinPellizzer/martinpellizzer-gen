    "intro": "Cogswellia austiniae, commonly known as the Austin's cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family. Native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico, it is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems that form a compact, globular shape. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring, which are often followed by small, red fruits. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and cactus enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
