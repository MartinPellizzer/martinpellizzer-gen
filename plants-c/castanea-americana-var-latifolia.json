    "intro": "Castanea americana var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, elongated leaves that are typically 6 to 12 inches long. The tree produces edible nuts enclosed in spiny husks, which mature in the fall. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same tree. The broad-leaf chestnut is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical importance in American forests."
