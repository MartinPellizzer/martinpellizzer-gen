It is native to regions of the Middle East and Central Asia, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features tendrils that allow it to climb and twine around other vegetation, a characteristic common in many members of its family. Its small, tubular flowers are typically pale purple or white, and they bloom in spring. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and often hairy, contributing to its adaptability in harsh climates."
