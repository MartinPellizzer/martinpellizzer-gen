It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers, which contrast with the typical white or pink hues of other hawthorn species. The plant is deciduous, producing small, red berries in the fall that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or open areas with well-drained soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
