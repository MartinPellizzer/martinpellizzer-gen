    "intro": "Cichorium nanum, commonly known as dwarf chicory, is a small annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are fibrous and can be harvested for use in herbal teas or as a vegetable. Cichorium nanum is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
