    "intro": "Cecropia setico, commonly known as the velvet tree, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its roots form extensive networks that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant is often used in reforestation projects due to its rapid growth and ecological benefits."
