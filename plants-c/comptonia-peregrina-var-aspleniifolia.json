    "intro": "Comptonia peregrina var. aspleniifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf sweet fern, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Betulaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested environments. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by winged seeds that aid in its dispersal. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is of particular interest in botanical conservation efforts."
