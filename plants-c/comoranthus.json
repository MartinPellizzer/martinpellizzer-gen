    "intro": "Comoranthus, commonly known as the Comoran beauty, is a flowering plant native to the Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, Comoranthus is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
