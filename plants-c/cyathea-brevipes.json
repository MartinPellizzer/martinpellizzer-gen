    "intro": "Cyathea brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its stout, short trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant is a member of the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting the growth of the upright trunk. Cyathea brevipes plays an important ecological role in New Zealand's forests, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability."
