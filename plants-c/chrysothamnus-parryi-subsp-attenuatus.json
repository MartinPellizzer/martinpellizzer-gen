    "intro": "Chrysothamnus parryi subsp. attenuatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and narrow, silvery-gray leaves. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open woodlands. It has a low, spreading growth habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The subspecies attenuatus is distinguished by its more elongated and narrower leaves compared to other subspecies of Chrysothamnus parryi."
