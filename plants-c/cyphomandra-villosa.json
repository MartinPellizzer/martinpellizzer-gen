    "intro": "Cyphomandra villosa, commonly known as the hairy nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and oval, dark green leaves with a slightly pubescent surface. Its flowers are typically white or pale purple, and it produces small, edible berries that are often used in traditional medicine. However, the plant contains solanine, a toxic alkaloid, so it should be handled with care."
