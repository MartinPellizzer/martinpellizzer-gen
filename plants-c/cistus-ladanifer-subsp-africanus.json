    "intro": "Cistus ladanifer subsp. africanus, commonly known as the African rockrose, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of pale pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a distinctive resinous scent, which is released when the leaves are crushed. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. The subspecies is closely related to other Cistus species found in the Mediterranean region but is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native habitat."
