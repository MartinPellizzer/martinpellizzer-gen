    "intro": "Castilleja galactionovae, commonly known as the Galacton Valley milkvetch, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces bright yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is typically found in rocky or sandy soils in arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
