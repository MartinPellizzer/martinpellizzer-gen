    "intro": "Carmichaelia flagelliformis var. acuminata, commonly known as the sharp-tipped tree fern, is a striking member of the Cyatheaceae family. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Its unique appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical gardens. The varietal name 'acuminata' refers to the sharply pointed tips of its fronds, which distinguish it from other varieties of Carmichaelia."
