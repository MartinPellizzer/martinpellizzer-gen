    "intro": "Ceratopteris chingii, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are divided into small, serrated pinnae. The plant thrives in freshwater environments and is often found in slow-moving streams and ponds. Its rhizomes form a network beneath the water surface, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients. Ceratopteris chingii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
