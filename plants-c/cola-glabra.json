    "intro": "Cola glabra, commonly known as African cola or kola nut, is a small evergreen tree native to western and central Africa. It belongs to the Sterculiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces large, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody capsules containing the aromatic seeds known as kola nuts. These nuts are rich in caffeine and have been used for centuries in cultural, medicinal, and commercial contexts."
