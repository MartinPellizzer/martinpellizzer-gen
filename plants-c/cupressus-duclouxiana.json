    "intro": "Cupressus duclouxiana, commonly known as the Ducloux's cypress, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and scale-like foliage that is typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown hue, and its bark is reddish and fissured. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Due to its limited range and vulnerability to environmental stressors, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
