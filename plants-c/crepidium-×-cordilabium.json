    "intro": "Crepidium \u00d7 cordilabium, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Crepidium flexuosum and Crepidium conicum. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, often branched stem and linear, grass-like leaves. The plant produces inflorescences with small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that are typically arranged in a raceme. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is native to parts of Asia, particularly China and Japan. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
