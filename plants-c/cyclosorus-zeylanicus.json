    "intro": "Cyclosorus zeylanicus, commonly known as the Ceylon water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically divided into four lobes, giving it a clover-like appearance. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes help in the absorption of nutrients from the water, contributing to its ecological role in aquatic ecosystems. Cyclosorus zeylanicus is also noted for its ability to tolerate a range of water conditions, making it a resilient and adaptable species."
