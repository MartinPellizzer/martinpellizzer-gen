It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some areas. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower heads."
