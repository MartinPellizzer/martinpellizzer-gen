    "intro": "Cotoneaster hersianus, commonly known as the Herrian cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 meters, featuring dense, compact foliage with elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Cotoneaster hersianus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions."
