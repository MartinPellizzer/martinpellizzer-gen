    "intro": "Chrysoglossum neocaledonicum, commonly known as the New Caledonian chrysoglossum, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the rainforests of New Caledonia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near stream banks or in rocky crevices. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface and produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology and is adapted to the humid, nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
