    "intro": "Chamaesyce perlignea, commonly known as the redstem sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, hairy stems that often turn reddish as the plant matures. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Chamaesyce perlignea is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along roadsides and in desert scrub habitats."
