    "intro": "Cyperus flavoculmis, commonly known as the yellow-eyed flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, triangular leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to brownish flowers, which are typically arranged in dense spikes. It thrives in wet or marshy environments, making it a common sight in swampy areas and along riverbanks. Cyperus flavoculmis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
