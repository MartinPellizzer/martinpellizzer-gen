    "intro": "Cereus phoeniceus subsp. conoideus, commonly known as the Queen of the Night, is a succulent cactus native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of white, night-blooming flowers. The plant has sharp, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its flowers open only at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. This subspecies is prized for its striking appearance and unique flowering behavior."
