    "intro": "Castilleja pallida var. miniata, commonly known as the pale castilleja, is a hemiparasitic plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family. It is characterized by its reduced leaves and bright orange to red flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. This species typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, often in the western United States. It forms symbiotic relationships with the roots of other plants, drawing nutrients from them. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
