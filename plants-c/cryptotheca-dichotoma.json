    "intro": "Cryptotheca dichotoma, commonly known as the two-branched cryptotheca, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces yellowish-orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and opposite, often covered in fine hairs. Cryptotheca dichotoma is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common sight in coastal environments."
