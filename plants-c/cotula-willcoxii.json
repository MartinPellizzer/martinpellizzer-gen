    "intro": "Cotula willcoxii, commonly known as Willcox's daisy, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing herb with small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in yellow and white. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, and it typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils. Cotula willcoxii is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, where it adapts to drought conditions. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small insects."
