    "intro": "Calamus heliotropium, commonly known as the sun compass, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its upright, herbaceous stems and clusters of small, pinkish flowers. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in wet, marshy environments, often found near water bodies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps in reducing water loss. Calamus heliotropium is also noted for its medicinal properties, used traditionally in some cultures for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects."
