    "intro": "Caltha palustris var. normalis, commonly known as the marsh marigold, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has alternate, broadly ovate leaves that are covered in a soft, downy layer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found along stream banks and in marshy areas. The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance."
