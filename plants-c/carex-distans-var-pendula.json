    "intro": "Carex distans var. pendula, commonly known as the hanging sedge, is a variant of the slender sedge native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its drooping, grass-like foliage that gives it a distinctive, cascading appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in marshes or along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, three-lobed flowers, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. This variety is valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
