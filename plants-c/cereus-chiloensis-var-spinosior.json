    "intro": "Cereus chiloensis var. spinosior, commonly known as the spiny night bloomer, is a succulent cactus native to Chile. It features a tall, columnar stem with numerous spines, which provide protection against herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Its unique morphology and nocturnal blooming make it a striking addition to xeriscapes and desert gardens."
