    "intro": "Cornus oblonga var. griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by red berries in the fall. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage, flowers, and berries, which provide seasonal interest."
