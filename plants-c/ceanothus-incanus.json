It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, blue or purple flowers in early spring. It is often found in rocky soils and dry habitats, such as chaparral and coastal areas. Ceanothus incanus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
