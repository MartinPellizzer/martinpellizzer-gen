    "intro": "Carduus nutans subsp. sporadum, commonly known as the nodding thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and a single, showy purple flower head that nods downward, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, which attract various pollinators. The subspecies sporadum is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and shorter, more upright stem compared to the typical form of Carduus nutans."
