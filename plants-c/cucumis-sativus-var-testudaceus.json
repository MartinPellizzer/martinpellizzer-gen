    "intro": "Cucumis sativus var. testudaceus, commonly known as the spiny gourd, is a variant of the common cucumber with distinctive spiny ridges along its surface. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is typically cultivated for its edible, elongated fruits. The plant has a vigorous vine growth habit, producing large, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers. Its fruits are usually harvested when immature, before the spines become too prominent. The botanical features of this variety make it adaptable to a range of growing conditions, though it prefers warm climates with well-drained soil."
