It is characterized by its vibrant, purplish foliage, which adds a dramatic visual element to gardens. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical and subtropical regions."
