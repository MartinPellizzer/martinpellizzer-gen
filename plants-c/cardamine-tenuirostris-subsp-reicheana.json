    "intro": "Cardamine tenuirostris subsp. reicheana, commonly known as the narrow-beaked water crowfoot, is a flowering plant in the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. This subspecies is typically found in wet or moist environments such as stream banks and marshes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
