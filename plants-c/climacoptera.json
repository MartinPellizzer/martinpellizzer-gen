It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and squash, and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features tendrils that allow it to ascend vertical surfaces, such as trees or walls, in search of sunlight. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and can vary in size depending on environmental conditions. Climacoptera produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
