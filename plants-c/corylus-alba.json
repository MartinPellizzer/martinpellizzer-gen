    "intro": "Corylus alba, commonly known as the European hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It produces edible nuts enclosed in spiny husks, which mature in the fall. The plant has finely toothed leaves that turn yellow in autumn, and its catkin-like flowers appear in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. The European hazel is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
