    "intro": "Cheilanthes induta, commonly known as the rock fern or desert shield fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, drought-tolerant growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant has pinnately divided, evergreen fronds that are typically grayish-green in color, with a leathery texture that helps reduce water loss. It reproduces via spores, which are released from the underside of its fertile fronds. Cheilanthes induta is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a hardy and resilient plant in xerophytic ecosystems."
