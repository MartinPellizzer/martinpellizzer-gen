    "intro": "Carlina fontanesii, commonly known as the mountain carline thistle, is a perennial herb native to the high elevations of the Pyrenees and southern France. It features a rosette of blue-gray, hairy leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. The plant produces showy purple-blue flower heads that resemble thistles, with ray florets surrounding a central disk. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Carlina fontanesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in mountain ecosystems."
