    "intro": "Coriaria ruscifolia subsp. ruscifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf coralroot, is a flowering plant species native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Coriariaceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from its host. The plant typically has a short, stout stem with whorled leaves that are often green or red in color. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, and its fruit is a capsule containing numerous tiny seeds. Due to its specialized growth habits, it is often found in shaded, moist forest environments."
