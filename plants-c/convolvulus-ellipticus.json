    "intro": "Convolvulus ellipticus, commonly known as the narrowleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in the morning, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Convolvulus ellipticus is a perennial herb that can spread aggressively through its runners, making it both ornamental and potentially invasive in certain environments."
