    "intro": "Carex glauca var. attenuata, commonly known as blue-green sedge, is a variant of the blue-green sedge species native to North America. It is a perennial grass-like plant that typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually a bluish-green color, with a distinctive sheath at the base of each leaf blade. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne on elongated, cylindrical inflorescences. This plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
