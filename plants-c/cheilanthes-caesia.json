    "intro": "Cheilanthes caesia, commonly known as the blue-tongued fern, is a species of rock fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of lance-shaped, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small groups. Cheilanthes caesia is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy and resilient plant in its native habitat."
