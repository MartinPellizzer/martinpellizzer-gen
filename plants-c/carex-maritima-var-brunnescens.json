It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, dark green leaves that often have a reddish or brownish hue. This variety thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is commonly found in dune environments. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale to brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated."
