    "intro": "Cereus versicolor var. lasiacanthus, commonly known as the rainbow cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, yellow, and orange, often appearing at night. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun exposure to bloom optimally. Due to its unique appearance and flowering habits, it is a popular choice for both ornamental and horticultural collections."
