It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy, ovate leaves and clusters of white or pinkish flowers. The flowers typically bloom in early spring, producing tiny petals that are narrow and elongated. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to thrive in temperate climates. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
