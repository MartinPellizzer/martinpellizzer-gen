    "intro": "Cuscuta corniculata var. sphaerocyma, commonly known as the globe dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to various regions in North America and is often found on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through mechanical means, allowing it to colonize new areas. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in ecological systems by influencing host plant growth and diversity."
