    "intro": "Calea trianae, commonly known as the \"flower of the night,\" is a striking plant native to Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its large, showy, night-blooming flowers that emit a strong, spicy scent. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. Its flowers open in the evening and close by dawn, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Calea trianae is also valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
