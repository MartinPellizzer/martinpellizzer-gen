It is characterized by its intricate, fern-like foliage composed of finely divided, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its delicate appearance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
