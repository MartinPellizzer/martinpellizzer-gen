    "intro": "Chloraea lotensis, commonly known as the water lettuce, is a tropical aquatic plant native to the Americas. It has a rosette-like structure with broad, waxy leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. It is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
