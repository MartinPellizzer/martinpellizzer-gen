    "intro": "Clibadium acuminatum, commonly known as the African snake plant, is a hardy, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with prominent veins, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its drought tolerance and ability to withstand poor soil conditions make it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions."
