    "intro": "Cyrtochilum tenense, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit. The plant produces striking golden-yellow flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, which is a key feature in its pollination strategy. Cyrtochilum tenense thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral morphology and ecological adaptations to its tropical habitat."
