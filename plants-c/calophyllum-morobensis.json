    "intro": "Calophyllum morobensis, commonly known as the Morobe calophyllum, is a tropical tree native to the Pacific islands, particularly Papua New Guinea. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green foliage and produces small, fragrant yellow flowers. The tree's fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. The plant is valued for its hard, durable wood and has cultural significance in some indigenous communities."
