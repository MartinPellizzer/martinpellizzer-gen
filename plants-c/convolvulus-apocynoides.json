    "intro": "Convolvulus apocynoides, commonly known as the sandhill morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a climbing or trailing herb with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and are typically borne in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh environments. The plant's rapid growth and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and garden use."
