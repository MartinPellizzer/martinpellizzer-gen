    "intro": "Crotalaria incana f. lanata, commonly known as the woolly cowpea, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its hairy foliage, which gives it the specific epithet *lanata*, helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant is also known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural settings."
