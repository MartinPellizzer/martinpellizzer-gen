    "intro": "Carduus eremocephalus, commonly known as the desert thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a tall, spiny stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting a dense cluster of yellow flowers. The plant has silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a distinctive, globe-shaped inflorescence. The plant is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations."
