    "intro": "Corybas rotundifolius, commonly known as the round-leafed helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, helmet-shaped flower that is typically greenish-brown in color. The plant has a short, stocky rhizome and produces a single, showy flower with a narrow, hood-like labellum. Its leaves are rounded and thick, often forming a rosette near the base. Corybas rotundifolius thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the cool, humid climates of its native habitat."
