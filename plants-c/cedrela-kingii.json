    "intro": "Cedrela kingii, commonly known as African teak, is a tropical tree native to Central and Southern Africa. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its straight, durable wood that is highly valued for its strength and resistance to decay. The tree typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters and has simple, alternate leaves with a lanceolate shape. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, elongated fruits containing flat, winged seeds. Due to overexploitation, Cedrela kingii is now listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List."
