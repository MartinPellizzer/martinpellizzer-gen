    "intro": "Callitriche microphylla, commonly known as lesser water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and ditches. The plant has tiny, opposite leaves that are usually less than 1 centimeter in length, giving it a delicate appearance. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, often appearing in clusters near the water's surface. Callitriche microphylla plays a role in stabilizing aquatic sediments and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
