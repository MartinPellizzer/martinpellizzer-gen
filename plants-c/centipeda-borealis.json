    "intro": "Centipeda borealis, commonly known as the Arctic willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to the harsh, cold environments of its habitat. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing food for local wildlife. Centipeda borealis is also used in traditional medicine by indigenous peoples for its purported health benefits."
