    "intro": "Cryptantha catalinensis, commonly known as Catalina cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the Channel Islands of California. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, showy blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native range. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
