    "intro": "Coelogyne sanderiana, commonly known as the Sander's orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant has long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and surrounding substrate. Coelogyne sanderiana is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its striking floral display."
