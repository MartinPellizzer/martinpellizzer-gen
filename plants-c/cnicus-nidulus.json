    "intro": "Cnicus nidulus, commonly known as the common groundsel, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with hairy stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves. Its yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and the plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called cypselae. Cnicus nidulus is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
