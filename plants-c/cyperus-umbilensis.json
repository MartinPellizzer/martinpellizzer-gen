    "intro": "Cyperus umbilensis, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that are often submerged or floating. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in moist soils. Cyperus umbilensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
