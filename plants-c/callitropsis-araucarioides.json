It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and distinctive, scale-like leaves. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind.

The plant plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat for various species of birds and insects."
