It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Calcaratolobelia macrocentron is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native ecosystems."
