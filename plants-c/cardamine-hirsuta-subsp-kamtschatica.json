    "intro": "Cardamine hirsuta subsp. kamtschatica, commonly known as Kamchatka hairy watercress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations to its wet habitat, aiding in water retention. The subspecies is native to the Russian Far East and parts of northern Asia."
