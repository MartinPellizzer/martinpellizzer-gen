    "intro": "Cynanchum franciscoi, commonly known as the California milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has adapted to arid conditions through its deep root system. Its leaves are alternate and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Cynanchum franciscoi is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic to some animals."
