    "intro": "Carex vesicaria, commonly known as the bladder sedge, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wetlands. The plant has grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes help it spread and form dense colonies, making it a common component of wetland ecosystems. The plant is also known for its distinctive, inflated bracts that give it its common name."
