It typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and marshes. The plant has finely divided, delicate fronds that are often submerged or floating. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it to substrates in aquatic habitats. Cystopteris dickieana plays a role in maintaining water quality and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
