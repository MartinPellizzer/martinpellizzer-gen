    "intro": "Chionanthus avilensis, commonly known as the white fringe tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring, forming long, pendulous clusters. The leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate, with a glossy green upper surface and a pale underside. The plant has a smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and its fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to a variety of soil types."
