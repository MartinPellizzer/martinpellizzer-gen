    "intro": "Callirhoe papaver, commonly known as the scarlet globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves and produces distinctive, inflated seed pods that split open when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for xeriscaping. The botanical name reflects its resemblance to a poppy, though it belongs to the Malvaceae family."
