    "intro": "Coursetia mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican coursetia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats. Coursetia mexicana plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various insects and small animals."
