    "intro": "Claoxylon papyraceum, commonly known as the paperwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, white flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its wood is lightweight and fibrous, making it valuable for paper production and other industrial uses. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests."
