    "intro": "Coryphantha ottonis, commonly known as the Otto's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless plant with a globular to cylindrical stem that can reach up to 30 centimeters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible and often used in traditional cuisine. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Coryphantha ottonis is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
