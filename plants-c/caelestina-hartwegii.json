    "intro": "Caelestina hartwegii, commonly known as the Hartweg's skyflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts. Its botanical features make it a unique subject of study in ecological and horticultural research."
