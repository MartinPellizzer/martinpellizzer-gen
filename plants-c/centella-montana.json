    "intro": "Centella montana, commonly known as mountain pennywort, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Centella montana is also valued for its potential medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
