    "intro": "Calamagrostis sesquitriflora, commonly known as the three-flowered reed, is a grass species native to parts of Asia, including China and Korea. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear three to five flowering branches, giving it its common name. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and stream banks, and is often found in temperate climates. The botanical features of Calamagrostis sesquitriflora make it an important species in ecological studies and wetland conservation efforts."
