    "intro": "Calligonum russanovii, commonly known as the Russian sandthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, helping to reduce water loss. It thrives in sandy soils and is well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Calligonum russanovii plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat."
