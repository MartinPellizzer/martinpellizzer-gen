    "intro": "Calomeria, commonly known as the desert lily, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants typically have erect, branching stems and produce showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to red. Calomeria species are adapted to harsh, dry environments, with thick leaves and deep root systems to conserve water. They are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
