It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, and its compact, rounded growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens. Its aromatic leaves and flowers make it a valuable plant for both ornamental and ecological purposes."
