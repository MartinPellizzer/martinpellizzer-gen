    "intro": "Cupressus darjeelingensis, commonly known as the Darjeeling cypress, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and dense foliage of scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in cool, moist climates at high altitudes, often found in cloud forests. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically important for conservation efforts in its native range."
