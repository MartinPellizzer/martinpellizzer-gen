    "intro": "Caryophyllata prolifera, commonly known as the flowering cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South America. It features a compact, branching structure with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically vibrant red or pink, blooming in spring and attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a shallow root system that allows it to absorb moisture from the soil surface efficiently. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in low-water environments."
