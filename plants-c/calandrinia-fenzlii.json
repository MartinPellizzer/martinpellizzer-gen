    "intro": "Calandrinia fenzlii, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant has hairy, succulent stems and leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. It produces vibrant pink or red flowers that bloom in the early morning, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Calandrinia fenzlii is often found in rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions."
