    "intro": "Consolea microcarpa, commonly known as the miniature candelabra cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and small, spiny stems that grow in a candelabra-like formation. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by small, round fruits. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-draining soil and full sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor and outdoor succulent gardens."
