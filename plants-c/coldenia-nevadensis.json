    "intro": "[WRONG START] Colderia nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada coldenia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and gravelly soils. It is adapted to arid conditions and has a low, sprawling growth habit. Coldenia nevadensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution."
