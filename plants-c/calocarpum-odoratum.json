    "intro": "Calocarpum odoratum, commonly known as the fragrant calocarpum, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically covered in a fine, powdery coating. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and usually have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. While not widely cultivated for ornamental purposes, it is sometimes appreciated for its subtle fragrance and ecological value to local wildlife."
