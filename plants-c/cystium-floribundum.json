    "intro": "Cystium floribundum, commonly known as the common sea buckthorn, is a shrub native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellow-orange berries that are rich in vitamin C and other nutrients. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime climates. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Cystium floribundum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
