It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces small, black, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Coprosma arborea is often found in coastal and lowland forest habitats, where it contributes to the understory vegetation."
