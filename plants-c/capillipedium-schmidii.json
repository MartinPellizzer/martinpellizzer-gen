    "intro": "Capillipedium schmidii, commonly known as the Schmid's capillary moss, is a small, delicate moss species belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its finely branched, leaf-like structures that are typically less than 1 millimeter in length. The plant exhibits a creeping growth habit, forming dense mats on rocky substrates, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually elongated and have a distinct mid-rib, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Capillipedium schmidii is primarily found in regions with low humidity and is adapted to withstand periods of desiccation."
