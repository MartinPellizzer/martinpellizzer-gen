    "intro": "Cirsium rechingeri var. tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves covered in a dense layer of white, fuzzy hairs, which give it a distinctive woolly appearance. The plant produces purple to pinkish flowers in late summer, which are arranged in a spherical shape known as a \"globular head.\" It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
