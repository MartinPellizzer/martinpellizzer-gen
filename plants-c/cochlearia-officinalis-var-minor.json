It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in coastal areas or along the edges of salt marshes. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are yellow and attract various pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitats."
