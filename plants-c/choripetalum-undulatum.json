    "intro": "Choripetalum undulatum, commonly known as the undulating petal orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant features a slender, upright stem with a few leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its unique floral structure includes petals that are slightly curled and undulated, giving it its common name. Choripetalum undulatum is often grown in greenhouses due to its specific climate requirements."
