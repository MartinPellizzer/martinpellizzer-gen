    "intro": "Crataegus \u00d7 killinica, commonly known as the Killinichoke or Killinichoke hawthorn, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Crataegus monogyna and Crataegus laevigata. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 3 to 8 meters. The plant features thorny branches, ovate to elliptical leaves with serrated edges, and produces small, white or pinkish flowers in spring. Its fruit is a red, berry-like pome that ripens in the fall, providing food for various wildlife species. This plant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive form and seasonal interest."
