It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flower heads that are often mistaken for single flowers, but they are actually clusters of tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and floral arrangements. The plant is also known for its long-lasting blooms, which can persist for several weeks."
