    "intro": "Ceratostylis latuensis, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features slender, upright stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in a raceme, with pale yellow to greenish-white petals. This orchid is notable for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption."
