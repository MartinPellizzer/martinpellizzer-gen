    "intro": "Chevaliera pallida, commonly known as the pale chevaliera, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely used in horticulture beyond its native range."
