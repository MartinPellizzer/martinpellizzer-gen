It is characterized by its dark, almost black stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as swamps and floodplains. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spikelet with small, three-lobed flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental appearance."
