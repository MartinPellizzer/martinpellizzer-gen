    "intro": "Colobocarpos, commonly known as the small-fruited mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae. It typically grows on the branches of various host trees, such as oaks and pines, and derives its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. Colobocarpos lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures that help reduce water loss. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, making it an important component of forest ecosystems."
