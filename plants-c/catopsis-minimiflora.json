    "intro": "Catopsis minimiflora, commonly known as the miniature flax or small-flowered catopsis, is a member of the Asparagaceae family. It is a small, evergreen perennial plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. The plant features compact rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. It produces tiny, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its ornamental appeal and ease of care, it is popular as a houseplant and is often used in rock gardens or as a foreground plant in succulent arrangements."
