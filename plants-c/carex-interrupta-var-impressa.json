    "intro": "Carex interrupta var. impressa, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is distinguished by its narrow leaves and distinctive leaf patterns, making it a valuable species for wetland restoration projects."
