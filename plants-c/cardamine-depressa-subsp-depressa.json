    "intro": "Cardamine depressa subsp. depressa, commonly known as the slender watercress, is a small perennial herb native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It typically grows in rocky or streamside habitats, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. The plant features trifoliate leaves with three elliptical or ovate leaflets, and its small white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in clusters. It produces elongated, slender pods that contain several tiny seeds. This subspecies is often found in riparian zones and is valued for its delicate, peppery flavor in culinary uses."
