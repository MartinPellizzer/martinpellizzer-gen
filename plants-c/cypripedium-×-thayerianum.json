    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 thayerianum, commonly known as the Thayer's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats, often in rich, organic soils. It produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, with a prominent yellow and green pattern on the pouch. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
