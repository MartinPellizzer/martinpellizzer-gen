    "intro": "Coryphantha recurvata, commonly known as the recurved coryphantha, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a powdery coating. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are reduced to small spines, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Coryphantha recurvata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to withstand drought conditions."
