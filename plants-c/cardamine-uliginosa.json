    "intro": "Cardamine uliginosa, commonly known as bog buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has a basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Cardamine uliginosa plays an important role in supporting local biodiversity by providing nectar for early pollinators."
