    "intro": "Calamus elongatus, commonly known as the long-stemmed arrowroot, is a member of the Arecaceae family, native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, slender stems and broad, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spadices, followed by the development of fibrous, starchy roots. These roots are harvested for their culinary and medicinal uses, particularly in traditional practices. The plant's botanical features make it well adapted to humid, shaded environments within its native habitat."
