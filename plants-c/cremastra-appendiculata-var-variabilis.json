    "intro": "Cremastra appendiculata var. variabilis, commonly known as the variable moonflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that bloom at night. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its unique nocturnal blooming habit and ornamental value make it a notable species in botanical gardens and natural habitats."
