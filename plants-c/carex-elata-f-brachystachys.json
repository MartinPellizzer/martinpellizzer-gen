    "intro": "Carex elata f. brachystachys, commonly known as the dwarf tussock sedge, is a compact, clump-forming perennial plant native to North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a bluish-green color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. It is valued in wetland restoration projects and as a low-maintenance ornamental plant in water gardens."
