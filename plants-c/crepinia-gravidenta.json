    "intro": "Crepinia gravidenta, commonly known as the coastal flax, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its linear, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense spikes, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to stabilize sandy soils, making it an important pioneer species in coastal dunes. Crepinia gravidenta is valued for its resilience and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
