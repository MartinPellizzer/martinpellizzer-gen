    "intro": "Ceanothus mocinoanus, commonly known as the Mocino's ceanothus, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate characterized by dry summers and wet winters. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant blue or purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and often have a distinctive bluish-gray color. Ceanothus mocinoanus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
