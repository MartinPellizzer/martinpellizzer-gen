    "intro": "Clusia clarendonensis, commonly known as the Clarendon glorybower, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically lance-shaped and arranged oppositely on the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, showy yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its robust growth habit makes it suitable for ornamental use in gardens and as a landscape plant. Clusia clarendonensis is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to partial shade."
