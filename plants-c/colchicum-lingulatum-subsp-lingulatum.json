    "intro": "Colchicum lingulatum subsp. lingulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved autumn crocus, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking purple or pink flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy layer. It produces distinctive, helmet-shaped corms that store nutrients for the next growing season. This species is adapted to grow in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats."
