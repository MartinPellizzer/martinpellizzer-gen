    "intro": "Cassuvium scabridum, commonly known as the roughleaf spirea, is a perennial shrub native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically rough to the touch, hence the species name \"scabridum,\" and are often serrated along the edges. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and cottage gardens. This plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
