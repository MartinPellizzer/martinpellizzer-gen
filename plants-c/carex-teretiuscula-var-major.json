    "intro": "Carex teretiuscula var. major, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Botanically, it is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
