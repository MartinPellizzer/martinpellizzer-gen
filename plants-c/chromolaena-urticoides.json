    "intro": "Chromolaena urticoides, commonly known as horseweed, is a tropical and subtropical plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is an invasive species characterized by its erect, hairy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. It is native to the Americas but has spread to many regions worldwide, often outcompeting native vegetation. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a significant weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems."
