    "intro": "Cullumia pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered cullumia, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky, dry habitats such as slopes and cliffs, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring. Its botanical structure is adapted to arid environments, with deep root systems to access moisture. Cullumia pauciflora is often found in association with other drought-tolerant flora in its native range."
