    "intro": "Cercocarpus parviflorus, commonly known as the low sagebrush, is a shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, woody stems, and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. The seeds are enclosed in woody, cone-like structures called nutlets, which are typical of the genus Cercocarpus."
