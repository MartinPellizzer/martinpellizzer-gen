    "intro": "Cystopteris fragilis var. baenitzii, commonly known as the brittle fern, is a variant of the common brittle fern, characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia, including Japan and China. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Its fronds are typically light green and have a fragile, papery texture. This variant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices."
