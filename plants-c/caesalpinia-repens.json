    "intro": "Caesalpinia repens, commonly known as the flame tree or red glorybower, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and distinctive, bright red or orange-pink bracts that resemble flames. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. Caesalpinia repens is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
