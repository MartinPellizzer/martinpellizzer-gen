It is characterized by its distinctive, serrated, and rough-textured leaves that are often covered in tiny, glandular dots. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Its stems are woody and can bear tendrils that aid in climbing. Cissus scabra is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
