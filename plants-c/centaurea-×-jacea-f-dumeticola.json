    "intro": "Centaurea \u00d7 jacea f. dumeticola, commonly known as the rough centaury, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features slender, upright stems that are often branched and covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces bright yellow to orange-red flowers arranged in dense, radial heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, with a rough texture due to the presence of stiff, bristly hairs. This variety is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils."
