    "intro": "Chthamalia pubiflora, commonly known as the hairy-flowered sea lettuce, is a marine algae belonging to the order Ulvales. It is characterized by its green color and fleshy, blade-like thallus that often has a hairy texture. This species is typically found in intertidal zones, where it adheres to rocky substrates. Chthamalia pubiflora reproduces through sexual reproduction, producing zoospores that develop into new plants. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
