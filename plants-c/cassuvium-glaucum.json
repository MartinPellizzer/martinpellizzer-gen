It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers and lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Its flowers bloom in late spring and are pollinated primarily by bees and butterflies. Cassuvium glaucum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
