    "intro": "Colymbada toletana, commonly known as the Toletan marsh orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to specific wetland habitats in Central Europe. It is a herbaceous perennial plant with a distinctive inflorescence composed of several showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant has a short, underground rhizome and produces small, linear leaves that are adapted to waterlogged soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, conservation efforts are critical for its survival."
