It is characterized by its quadrangular stems and small, yellowish flowers that develop into distinctive, bead-like pods. The plant is adapted to arid environments and has deep roots that help it survive in poor soils. Its seeds are rich in protein and are used as a food source in some parts of the world. Additionally, the plant has potential agricultural value due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
