    "intro": "Calamagrostis lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, blue-green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces feathery panicles of small, silver-gray flowers in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, swales, and along stream banks. Calamagrostis lanceolata is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
