    "intro": "Cardamine drakeana, commonly known as Drake's watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a raceme, often emerging above the water surface. Its roots are adapted for aquatic conditions, allowing it to thrive in slow-moving streams and ponds. Cardamine drakeana is often found in temperate regions and is noted for its delicate appearance and ecological significance in freshwater ecosystems."
