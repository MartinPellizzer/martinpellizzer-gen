    "intro": "Caucalis nodiflora, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant has a low-growing habit with creeping stems that form dense mats, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and slightly hairy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Caucalis nodiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
