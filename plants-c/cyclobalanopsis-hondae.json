    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis hondae, commonly known as Hondan ironwood, is a species of evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its hard, dense wood. The tree produces small, cupule-bearing nuts that are typically dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland and montane forests. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
