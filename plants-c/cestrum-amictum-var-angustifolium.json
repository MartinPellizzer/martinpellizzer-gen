    "intro": "Cestrum amictum var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ornamental value is appreciated in gardens, though caution is necessary due to its toxic properties."
