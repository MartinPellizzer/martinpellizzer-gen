    "intro": "Cupressus glauca, commonly known as the blue atlas cedar, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Atlas Mountains of North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive blue-gray foliage, which gives it a striking appearance in both natural and cultivated settings. The tree has scale-like leaves arranged in crossed pairs, and its cones are small and woody. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or arid landscapes. Cupressus glauca is also valued for its ornamental use in horticulture and its ability to thrive in dry, coastal environments."
