    "intro": "Cerasus integrifolia, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or sakura, is a species of deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its ornamental flowers, which bloom in spring and are typically white or pink. The plant has simple, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It produces small, hard fruits called cherries, which are edible but not as commonly consumed as other cherry varieties. Cerasus integrifolia is widely cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes."
