    "intro": "Copisma gibbum, commonly known as the hairy false hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features a basal rosette of broadly ovate, hairy, dark green leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with six petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Copisma gibbum typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in rich, organic soils. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf hairs and its ability to thrive in humid, temperate climates."
