    "intro": "Crepidium finetii, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a rare and delicate member of the orchid family native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Crepidium finetii is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
