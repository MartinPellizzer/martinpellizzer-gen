    "intro": "Convolvulus sylvaticus, commonly known as the woodland bindweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in woodland areas and along stream banks. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its vines can climb or trail along the ground, often entwining around other plants. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
