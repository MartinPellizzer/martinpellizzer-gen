    "intro": "Corynostylis benthamii, commonly known as the Benthams' clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern that belongs to the family Microlepidoteae. It is native to Australia, particularly found in the southeastern regions, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features a creeping rhizome with dense clusters of small, scale-like leaves. Its reproductive structures are unique, with sporangia borne on specialized stalks called sporophylls. Corynostylis benthamii is of interest to botanists due to its primitive characteristics and its role in understanding the evolution of ferns."
