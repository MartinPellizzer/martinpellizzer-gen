It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, cylindrical leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves often display a striking purple or reddish hue, especially under certain light conditions. This variation makes it a distinctive and visually appealing species in its native habitat."
