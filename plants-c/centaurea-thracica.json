    "intro": "Centaurea thracica, commonly known as the Thrace centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its bright blue or purple flowers are surrounded by pale yellow ray florets, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Centaurea thracica is known for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
