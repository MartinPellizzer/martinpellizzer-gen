    "intro": "Cryptogramma emeiensis, commonly known as the Emei cryptogramma, is a rare fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky substrates. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, typical of fern reproductive structures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
