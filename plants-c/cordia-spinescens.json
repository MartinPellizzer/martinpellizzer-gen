    "intro": "Cordia spinescens, commonly known as the spiny cordia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its spiny branches and opposite, ovate leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that are often followed by distinctive, spherical, red or orange fruits. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. Cordia spinescens is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to withstand periods of drought."
