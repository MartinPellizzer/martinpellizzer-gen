It features slender, hairy stems that often lie flat on the ground, forming a dense mat. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly curled at the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. Crepis cernua is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
