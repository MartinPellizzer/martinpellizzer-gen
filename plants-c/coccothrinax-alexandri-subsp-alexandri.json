    "intro": "Coccothrinax alexandri subsp. alexandri, commonly known as the Alexander's palm, is a rare and endemic palm species native to the island of Hispaniola. It is a small to medium-sized palm characterized by its slender trunk and pinnate leaves that are often clustered at the top of the plant. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by dark blue, spherical fruits that are edible. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in coastal areas and limestone formations. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
