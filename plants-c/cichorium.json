    "intro": "Cichorium, commonly known as chicory, is a genus of flowering plants in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It includes both annual and perennial species, many of which are cultivated for their edible leaves, roots, and flowers. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a flowering stem that bears blue or purple flowers. Some species, like Cichorium intybus, are valued for their bitter leaves used in salads and coffee substitutes. The roots of certain varieties are also used to produce a coffee-like beverage."
