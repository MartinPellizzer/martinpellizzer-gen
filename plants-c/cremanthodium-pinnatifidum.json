    "intro": "Cremanthodium pinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved goldcup, is a flowering plant native to the high mountain regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in alpine environments, where it tolerates cold temperatures and strong winds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
