    "intro": "Chaerefolium nitidum, commonly known as the glossy leaf vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale purple, which bloom in early summer. Native to southern Europe and western Asia, it thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
