    "intro": "Cnicus undulatus var. canescens, commonly known as the rough sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with silver-gray foliage covered in fine, hairy textures. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
