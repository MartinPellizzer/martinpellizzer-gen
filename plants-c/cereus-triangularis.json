    "intro": "Cereus triangularis, commonly known as the triangular cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, night-blooming flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Cereus triangularis is well adapted to desert conditions, with a deep root system and a slow growth rate."
