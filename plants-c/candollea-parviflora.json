It belongs to the family Cactaceae, which includes cacti and related succulent plants. The plant is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is often covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically small, yellowish-green, and appear in the axils of the stems. Candollea parviflora is adapted to arid environments and is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes."
