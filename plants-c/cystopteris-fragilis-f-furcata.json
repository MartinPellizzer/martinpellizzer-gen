    "intro": "Cystopteris fragilis f. furcata, commonly known as the fragrant fern, is a variant of the brittle bladder fern. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically light green and finely divided. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorocarps, which are clustered in groups. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
