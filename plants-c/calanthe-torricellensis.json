    "intro": "Calanthe torricellensis, commonly known as the Torricelli's calanthe, is a rare and elegant orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and its inflorescence consists of a single spike bearing several pale to dark violet flowers. Calanthe torricellensis is often found in shaded, humid environments, growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
