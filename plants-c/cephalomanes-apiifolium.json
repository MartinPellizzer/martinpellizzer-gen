    "intro": "Cephalomanes apiifolium, commonly known as the carrot leaf bug, is a species of plant in the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble those of carrots. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are aromatic and can be used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
