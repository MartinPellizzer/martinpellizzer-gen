    "intro": "Clappia, commonly known as false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to the Americas. The plants typically have basal leaves that are either lance-shaped or egg-shaped, and they produce small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Clappia species are often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. They are generally herbaceous and can spread through rhizomes or seeds."
