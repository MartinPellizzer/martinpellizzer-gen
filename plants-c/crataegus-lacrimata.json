It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous white flowers that appear in early spring, followed by small, ornamental red or yellow fruits in the fall. The plant has thorned branches and elliptical leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal. The weeping crabapple is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing food for birds and insects."
