    "intro": "Copiapoa cinerea var. longistaminea, commonly known as the long-stemmed white cactus, is a species native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces white, spiny flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a thick, water-storing stem adapted to arid conditions. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative cactus in dry climates."
