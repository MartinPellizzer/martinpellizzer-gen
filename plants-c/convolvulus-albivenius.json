    "intro": "Convolvulus albivenius, commonly known as the white-flowered morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the morning, hence its common name. Its flowers are typically five-petaled and have a trumpet-like shape, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Convolvulus albivenius is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
