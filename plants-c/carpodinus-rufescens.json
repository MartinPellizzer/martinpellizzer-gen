    "intro": "Carpodinus rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, erect stems that are often reddish in color, which distinguish it from other grass species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth surface and parallel venation. Carpodinus rufescens thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas."
