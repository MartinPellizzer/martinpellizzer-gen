    "intro": "Cactus lanatus, commonly known as the wooly cactus, is a succulent plant native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly covering that protects it from intense sunlight and water loss. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, where it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its flowers, which are often yellow or orange, appear during the warmer months and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The wooly cactus is adapted to survive in harsh conditions with minimal rainfall."
