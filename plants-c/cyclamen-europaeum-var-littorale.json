    "intro": "Cyclamen europaeum var. littorale, commonly known as the coastal cyclamen, is a herbaceous perennial native to the coastal regions of southern Europe. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves with a distinctive silvery underside, and produces delicate, spurred flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial shade to full sun, depending on the climate. It is often found growing along rocky shores and in coastal meadows, where it tolerates salt spray and coastal winds. Cyclamen europaeum var. littorale is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
