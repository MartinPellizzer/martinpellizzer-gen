It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and thrives in coastal areas. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in spring. Centropogon coleoides is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered a pioneer species in certain ecosystems."
