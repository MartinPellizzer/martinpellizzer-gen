    "intro": "Crocus biflorus var. milleri, commonly known as the Milleri crocus, is a species of flowering plant in the Iridaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and is characterized by its early blooming period, typically in late autumn or early winter. The plant produces clusters of delicate, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a distinctive purple or violet stripe. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. The bulbs are perennial, allowing the plant to return year after year in suitable climates."
