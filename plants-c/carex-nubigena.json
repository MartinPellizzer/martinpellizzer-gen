    "intro": "Carex nubigena, commonly known as the cloud fern sedge, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests where humidity is high. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats. Carex nubigena is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in its native habitat."
