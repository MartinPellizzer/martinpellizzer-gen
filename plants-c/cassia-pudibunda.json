It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological importance. The seeds are enclosed in pod-like fruits and are dispersed by wind, aiding in the plant's propagation."
