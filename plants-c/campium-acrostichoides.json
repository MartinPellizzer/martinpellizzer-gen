    "intro": "Campium acrostichoides, commonly known as the broadleaf buttonweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features a rosette of broad, waxy, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, round, brown fruits. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
