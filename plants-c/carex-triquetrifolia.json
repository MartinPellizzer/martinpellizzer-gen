It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in three ranks, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are usually clustered in a cylindrical inflorescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream edges.
