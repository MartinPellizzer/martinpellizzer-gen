It is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are narrow and pinnatifid, with a distinctive aromatic scent. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Celsia baetica is considered a vulnerable species."
