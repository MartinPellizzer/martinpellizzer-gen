    "intro": "Coleus fruticosus, commonly known as red curl, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that range from red to purple, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or yellow flowers that appear in clusters at the base of the bracts. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and can be green, red, or variegated, adding to its ornamental value. Coleus fruticosus thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and indoor spaces."
