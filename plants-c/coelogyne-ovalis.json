    "intro": "Coelogyne ovalis, commonly known as the oval orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, sword-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in its natural habitat. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Coelogyne ovalis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
