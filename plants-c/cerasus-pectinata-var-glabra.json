    "intro": "Cerasus pectinata var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth cherry or Japanese sweet cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It features simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy green upper surface. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by sweet, edible fruits that are typically red or yellow when ripe. The bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil."
