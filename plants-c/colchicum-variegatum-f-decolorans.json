    "intro": "Colchicum variegatum f. decolorans, commonly known as the variegated autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, often variegated leaves with a mix of green and white or yellow markings. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. Its bulbs are toxic and contain colchicine, a compound used in medicine. This variant is distinguished by its reduced pigmentation compared to the typical form, giving it a more subdued appearance."
