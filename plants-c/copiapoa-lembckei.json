    "intro": "Copiapoa lembckei, commonly known as the Lembcke's cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is a columnar cactus with a ribbed stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are typically borne near the top of the stem. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. The plant's structure and growth patterns reflect its evolutionary response to extreme desert conditions."
