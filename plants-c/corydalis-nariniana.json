    "intro": "Corydalis nariniana, commonly known as the Nariniana lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and purple. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral structure, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
