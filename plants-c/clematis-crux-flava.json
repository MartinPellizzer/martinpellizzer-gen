It features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its flowers are typically yellow or orange, often with a distinctive crux-shaped pattern. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking vibrant, flowering climbers."
