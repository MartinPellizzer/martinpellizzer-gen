    "intro": "Chloris longifolia, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to Australia. It features slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Chloris longifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
