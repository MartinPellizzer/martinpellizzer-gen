    "intro": "Camelina aquatica, commonly known as water camelina, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as mustard and broccoli. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, featuring small, yellow flowers and pinnately compound leaves. Its seeds are encased in a hard, capsule-like structure, and it is adapted to thrive in environments with fluctuating water levels. Camelina aquatica plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
