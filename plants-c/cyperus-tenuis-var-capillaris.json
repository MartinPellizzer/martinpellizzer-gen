    "intro": "Cyperus tenuis var. capillaris, commonly known as slender flatsedge, is a grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically develop in clusters. This species is native to tropical and subtropical regions and thrives in wet or moist environments. It often grows in marshy areas, along stream banks, or in poorly drained soils. The plant's rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
