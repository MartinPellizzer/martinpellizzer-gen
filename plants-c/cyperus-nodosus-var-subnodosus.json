    "intro": "Cyperus nodosus var. subnodosus, commonly known as the nodding flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight sheen, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that develop into three-lobed, three-seeded fruits. This variant is distinguished from the typical Cyperus nodosus by its slightly different floral structure and growth habit."
