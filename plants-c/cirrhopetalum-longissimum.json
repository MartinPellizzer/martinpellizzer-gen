    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum longissimum, commonly known as the long-flowered cirrhopetalum, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated, and often hairy petals that give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Flowering occurs in the summer months, producing clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped blooms in shades of pink and white."
