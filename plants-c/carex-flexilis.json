    "intro": "Carex flexilis, commonly known as the flexible sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist habitats in North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. Carex flexilis thrives in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife. Its dense growth habit makes it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
