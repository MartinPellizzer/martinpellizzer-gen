    "intro": "Cyanea mauiensis, commonly known as Maui's sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of Hawaii. It has hairy leaves and produces capsules that contain numerous small seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyanea mauiensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
