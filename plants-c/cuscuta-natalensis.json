    "intro": "Cuscuta natalensis, commonly known as Natal dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to southern Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to species like Acacia or Euphorbia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure with slender, thread-like stems. It is often found in disturbed habitats and can be a nuisance to agricultural crops. Its life cycle is closely tied to the availability of suitable host plants in its environment."
