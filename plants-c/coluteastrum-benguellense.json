    "intro": "Coluteastrum benguellense, commonly known as the Benguella cress, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops such as mustard and cabbage. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within its family."
