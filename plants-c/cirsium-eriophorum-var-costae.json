    "intro": "Cirsium eriophorum var. costae, commonly known as the rough thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of stiff, spiny leaves that are typically gray-green in color and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear purple to pink flowers with prominent, bristly rays. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its morphology is adapted to reduce water loss and deter herbivores, making it a resilient species in its native range."
