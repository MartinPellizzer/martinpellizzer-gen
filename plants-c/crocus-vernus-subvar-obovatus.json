It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous underground stem. Its flowers are composed of six petals and are often visited by early pollinators such as bees and flies. The obovate crocus is valued in gardens for its early bloom and delicate appearance."
