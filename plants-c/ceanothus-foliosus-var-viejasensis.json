    "intro": "Ceanothus foliosus var. viejasensis, commonly known as Viejas ceanothus, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in chaparral and woodland ecosystems. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens. Its conservation status is of concern due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
