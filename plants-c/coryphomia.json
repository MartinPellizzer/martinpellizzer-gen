    "intro": "Coryphomia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their striking, spiky flower heads and are native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. The leaves are typically narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in saline environments. Coryphomia species are adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils, often found along shorelines. Their ornamental value makes them popular in horticulture, though they require well-drained soil and full sun."
