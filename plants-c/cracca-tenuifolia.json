It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is found in temperate regions of Europe and Asia. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, resembling those of other members of the carrot family. Cracca tenuifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and antispasmodic properties."
