It is characterized by its bright yellow inflorescences, which consist of numerous small flowers arranged in a panicle. The leaves are typically alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Goldenrod is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
