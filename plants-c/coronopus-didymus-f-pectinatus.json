    "intro": "Coronopus didymus f. pectinatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heartwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Violaceae. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of delicate pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps to retain moisture. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Coronopus didymus."
