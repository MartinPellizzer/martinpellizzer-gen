    "intro": "Cirrhaea livida, commonly known as the blue cirrhaea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, whitish hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue or violet, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
