    "intro": "Caralluma valida, commonly known as the devil's tongue or horned cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of India and Pakistan. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its branching stems covered in spines and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration. Caralluma valida is also noted for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine."
