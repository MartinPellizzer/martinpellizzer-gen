    "intro": "Capparis roxburghii, commonly known as the Kashmiri rose or Indian caper, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayas and parts of South Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky and arid environments, often found at high altitudes. The plant produces striking, pale pink to white flowers with a strong, pungent fragrance. Its fruits are fleshy and edible, though the plant is more valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine. Capparis roxburghii is also cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a source of capers in culinary applications."
