    "intro": "Campanula davurica, commonly known as the Siberian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, branched stems that can grow up to 60 cm in height, covered with soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, adapted to thrive in cooler, high-altitude environments. Campanula davurica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate poor soils."
