It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of bright yellow, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the warmer months. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cassia bijuga is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
