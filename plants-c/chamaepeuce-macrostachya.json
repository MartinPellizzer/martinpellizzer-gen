    "intro": "Chamaepeuce macrostachya, commonly known as the large-stemmed willow-herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and wetlands. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces, and it produces tall, branching stems that bear showy, pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Chamaepeuce macrostachya plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
