    "intro": "Colletia armata, commonly known as the woolly candelabra cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its branching, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its adaptations make it well-suited for desert and semi-arid habitats. Colletia armata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
