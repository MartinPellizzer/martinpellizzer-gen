It is native to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region, where it thrives in moist, wooded habitats. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers. It is often found growing along stream banks and in shaded understories of forests. Its botanical characteristics make it a notable species for ecological studies and native plant gardens."
