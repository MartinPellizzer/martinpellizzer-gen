    "intro": "Campanula scheuchzeri var. schleicheri, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the high altitudes of the European Alps. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to cold, rocky environments and thrives in well-drained soils. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and is known for its resilience in harsh alpine conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
