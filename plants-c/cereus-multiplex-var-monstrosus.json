    "intro": "Cereus multiplex var. monstrosus, commonly known as the Monstrose Cereus, is a striking cactus species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, swollen stem segments that form a tree-like structure, often with a spindly appearance. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting moths and other nocturnal pollinators. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in warm, dry climates."
