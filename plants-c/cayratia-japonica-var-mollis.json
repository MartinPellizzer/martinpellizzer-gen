    "intro": "Cayratia japonica var. mollis, commonly known as Japanese climbing hydrangea, is a deciduous vine native to East Asia. It features heart-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically covered in soft, velvety hairs, giving it the \"mollis\" designation, which means \"soft\" in Latin. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. Its climbing habit makes it suitable for trellises or arbors, and it is valued for its ornamental foliage and fragrant blooms. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a decorative, low-maintenance vine."
