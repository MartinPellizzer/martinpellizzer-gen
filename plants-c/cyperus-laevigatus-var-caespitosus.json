The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne on short, leaf-like bracts. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slightly rough texture, and the plant is often found in wet or moist soils. Cyperus laevigatus var. caespitosus is adapted to a variety of aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats, including marshes and pond edges."
