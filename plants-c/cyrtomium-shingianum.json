It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in small, round structures called sori. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Cyrtomium shingianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
