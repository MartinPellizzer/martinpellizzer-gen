It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of water bodies. Its leaves are usually dark green with prominent, light green veins, giving it a distinctive appearance. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in clusters, and are pollinated by wind rather than insects."
