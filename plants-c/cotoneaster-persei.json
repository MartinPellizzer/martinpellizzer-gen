It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. It is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils. Cotoneaster persei is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
