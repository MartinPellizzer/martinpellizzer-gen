    "intro": "Cleistogenes andropogonoides, commonly known as the eastern gamagrass, is a tall, perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically hidden within the foliage, a feature common in many grasses. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Cleistogenes andropogonoides plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
