    "intro": "Casearia puberula, commonly known as the silky casearia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by small, spherical berries. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Casearia puberula is often found in humid, shaded environments within rainforests."
