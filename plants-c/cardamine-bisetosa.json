It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other cruciferous plants. The plant features finely divided, pinnately compound leaves that are often submerged or floating in shallow water. Its small, white flowers are arranged in racemes and bloom in early spring. Cardamine bisetosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
