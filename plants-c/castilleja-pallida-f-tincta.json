    "intro": "Castilleja pallida f. tincta, commonly known as the pale castilleja, is a flowering plant in the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. The plant is characterized by its showy, red-orange to yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is often found in association with other plants like grasses and forbs."
