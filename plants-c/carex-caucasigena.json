    "intro": "Carex caucasigena, commonly known as Caucasian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, cylindrical inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in temperate regions, often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Carex caucasigena is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
