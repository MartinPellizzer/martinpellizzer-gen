    "intro": "Cornidia serratifolia, commonly known as the serrated leaf cornelia, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with serrated leaf margins, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody structure and adaptability to various soil types make it a resilient species in its native habitat. Cornidia serratifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
