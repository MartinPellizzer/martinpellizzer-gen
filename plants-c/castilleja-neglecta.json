    "intro": "Castilleja neglecta, commonly known as the slender Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems and lacks true leaves, relying on its root system to absorb nutrients from neighboring plants. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
