It is characterized by its alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, and its seeds are enclosed in dry, three-lobed capsules. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or arid environments.
