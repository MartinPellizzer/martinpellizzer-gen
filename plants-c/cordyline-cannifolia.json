    "intro": "Cordyline cannifolia, commonly known as the New Zealand cabbage tree, is a member of the Asparagaceae family. It is a tall, evergreen tree with a single, unbranched stem that can reach heights of up to 15 meters. Its leaves are large, strap-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters at the top of the stem. It is native to New Zealand and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and cultural significance."
