    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 kesselringii, commonly known as the Kesselringii lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically feature a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant produces a single, erect stem that can grow up to 60 cm in height, bearing a single, large flower with a waxy, pinkish-brown hue. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and rarity in the wild, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
