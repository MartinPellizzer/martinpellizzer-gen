    "intro": "Chamaecyparis lawsoniana f. lutea, commonly known as the golden spruce, is a rare and striking variant of the Lawson cypress. This cultivar is characterized by its golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts sharply with its bluish-gray needles. It is a compact, slow-growing tree with a conical shape and dense, feathery branches. The leaves are scale-like and retain their color throughout the growing season, making it a visually appealing ornamental plant. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, though it is sensitive to environmental stressors."
