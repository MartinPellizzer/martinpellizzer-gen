    "intro": "Cotyledon pillansii, commonly known as the Zulu ice plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for collectors and gardeners in arid climates."
