    "intro": "Chingia malodora, commonly known as the stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is notable for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is most pronounced when the flowers are in bloom. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in dense undergrowth. Despite its pungent scent, it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for certain insect species."
