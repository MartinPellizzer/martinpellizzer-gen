    "intro": "Cymopterus alpinus, commonly known as the alpine evening-primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, dry conditions. Its leaves are alternate and lance-shaped, and the plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. Cymopterus alpinus is adapted to harsh alpine environments and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
