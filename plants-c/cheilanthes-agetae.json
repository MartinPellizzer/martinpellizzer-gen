    "intro": "Cheilanthes agetae, commonly known as the silver fir fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America and the southern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, silver-gray fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in shaded, humid environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to crevices in cliffs and rock faces. Cheilanthes agetae is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant that is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
