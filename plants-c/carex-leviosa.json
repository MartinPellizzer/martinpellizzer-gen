    "intro": "Carex leviosa, commonly known as the floating sedge, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in shallow water. Carex leviosa is well adapted to moist soils and can tolerate periodic flooding."
