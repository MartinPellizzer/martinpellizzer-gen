    "intro": "Crepis kilimandscharica var. meruensis, commonly known as the Meru thistle, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant thrives in rocky and arid environments, often found in mountainous areas such as the Aberdare Range and Mount Kenya. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. This variety is part of the genus Crepis, which includes many species of flowering plants adapted to various ecological niches."
