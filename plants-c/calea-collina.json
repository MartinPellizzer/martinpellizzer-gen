    "intro": "Calea collina, commonly known as the \"flower of the night,\" is a striking plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy white petals that open at night and close in the morning, a behavior known as nyctinasty. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its aromatic foliage. Its leaves are velvety and often have a distinctive pattern of dark veins. Calea collina is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported calming effects."
