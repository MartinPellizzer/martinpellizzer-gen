    "intro": "Caragana frutex, commonly known as the shrub locust, is a deciduous shrub native to the cold climates of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 3 to 5 foliages long, and its small, yellowish flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Caragana frutex is known for its hardy nature, capable of thriving in poor soil conditions and extreme weather. Its extensive root system makes it an effective soil stabilizer in arid and semi-arid regions."
