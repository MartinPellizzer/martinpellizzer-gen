    "intro": "Cepobaculum foelschei, commonly known as the Foelsche's cepobaculum, is a rare and little-studied plant species belonging to the family Cepobacelaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring small, clustered leaves and inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked. The plant thrives in specific microhabitats, typically in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, which is a key aspect of its botanical significance. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
