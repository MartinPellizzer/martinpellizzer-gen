It typically grows to a height of 3 to 5 meters, featuring a slender, unbranched trunk and pinnate leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in panicles, followed by clustered, round fruits that contain a single seed. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
