    "intro": "Carex fascicularis, commonly known as the clustered sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its upright, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in three rows. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense, spike-like clusters, which are often surrounded by bracts. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Carex fascicularis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
