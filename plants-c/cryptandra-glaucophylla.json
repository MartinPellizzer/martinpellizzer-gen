    "intro": "Cryptandra glaucophylla, commonly known as the silver-leafed cryptandra, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color, which bloom in summer. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions with minimal water requirements. Cryptandra glaucophylla is often found in sandy soils and is a valuable component of the local flora in its native habitat."
