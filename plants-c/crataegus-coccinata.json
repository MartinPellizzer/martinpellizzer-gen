It is characterized by its clusters of bright red berries that persist through winter, providing food for wildlife. The plant has small, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces white or pinkish flowers in spring. Its bark is typically smooth and gray, with a tendency to peel in thin layers. Crataegus coccinata is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, contributing to ecological diversity in its habitat."
