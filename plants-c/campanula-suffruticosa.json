It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and thrives in well-drained soil in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. Campanula suffruticosa is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance once established."
