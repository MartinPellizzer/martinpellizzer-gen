    "intro": "Conyza wittei, commonly known as the silverleaf weed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white achene seeds. Conyza wittei is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain regions."
