    "intro": "Cheilanthes intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are resistant to drought. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in crevices or on cliffs. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments."
