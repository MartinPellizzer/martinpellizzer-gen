    "intro": "Cacotanis, commonly known as the bitterleaf plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its hairy, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and riverbanks. Its leaves are known for their bitter taste, which has led to its use in traditional medicine. Cacotanis species are also valued for their ornamental qualities and are sometimes cultivated for their unique foliage."
