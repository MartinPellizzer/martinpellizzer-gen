    "intro": "Cryptogramma crispa f. indica, commonly known as the Indian cryptogramma, is a rare fern species native to the Himalayan region. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive crinkled appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its leaves are usually a deep green, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
