    "intro": "Cenchrus ciliaris var. villifer, commonly known as silky grass or buffelgrass, is a perennial grass species native to warm temperate and tropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a silvery sheen. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for pasture and erosion control. Its adaptability and rapid growth make it an important forage crop in arid and semi-arid environments."
