    "intro": "Cypripedium luteum var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the golden moccasin, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers with a distinctive green lip and a prominent, spurred dorsal sepal. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forests and has a pseudobulbous structure that helps it store water and nutrients. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it is considered an indicator species for undisturbed habitats. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as endangered in many regions."
