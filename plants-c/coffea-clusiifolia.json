    "intro": "Coffea clusiifolia, commonly known as the African coffee tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, white flowers. The plant produces red or orange berries containing one or two seeds, which are the source of its caffeine content. Although it is related to the coffee genus Coffea, it is not typically cultivated for commercial coffee production. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for horticultural and ecological studies."
