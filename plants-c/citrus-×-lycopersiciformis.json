    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 lycopersiciformis, commonly known as the hybrid tomato-citrus plant, is a rare and intriguing botanical hybrid that combines traits of both citrus and tomato plants. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants, and exhibits characteristics of both its parent species. The plant typically produces small, yellow-orange fruits that resemble both citrus fruits and tomatoes in appearance. Its unique morphology and genetic makeup make it a subject of interest in botanical research and horticultural experimentation. Due to its hybrid nature, it is not commonly cultivated for commercial purposes but is occasionally grown in specialized gardens or research settings."
