    "intro": "Chaunanthus, commonly known as the Chinese lantern or the flame flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bignoniaceae. These plants are native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that often display vibrant orange or red hues. The leaves are typically opposite and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Chaunanthus species are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens due to their striking floral displays. They thrive in full sun to partial shade and prefer well-drained soil."
