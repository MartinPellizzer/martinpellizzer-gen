    "intro": "Castilleja pannosa, commonly known as the pannose Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers that resemble a paintbrush. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its host plants for nutrients through specialized root structures called haustoria. It typically grows in open, sunny areas such as grasslands and sagebrush habitats. Castilleja pannosa plays a role in pollination and is often found in association with various grasses and shrubs."
