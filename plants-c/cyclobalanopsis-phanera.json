    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis phanera, commonly known as the broad-leafed ironwood, is a species of evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts, and is characterized by its hard, durable wood. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. It produces small, cup-shaped fruits that contain one or two seeds, and it is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its slow growth and high wood density, it is considered a valuable but rare species in its native habitat."
