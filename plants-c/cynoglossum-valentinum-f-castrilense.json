    "intro": "Cynoglossum valentinum f. castrilense, commonly known as the Valentine's bellflower, is a rare and ornamental variant of the heart-shaped bellflower. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy violet-blue flowers that resemble small bells, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring broad, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a sought-after addition to rock gardens and borders. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic value and botanical interest."
