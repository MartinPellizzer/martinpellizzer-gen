    "intro": "Calendula incana var. prostrata, commonly known as creeping calendula, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features soft, hairy stems that lie close to the ground, forming a mat-like growth habit. The plant produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers with a distinctive, slightly rough texture. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its fuzzy appearance. It is often used in herbal medicine and as a ornamental plant due to its hardiness and colorful blooms."
