It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble peacock feathers, with a mix of white, pink, and purple hues. The plant features a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, and it produces long, arching inflorescences. Its leaves are elliptical and dark green, often with a waxy texture. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
