    "intro": "Clibadium rimachii, commonly known as the Peruvian balsa, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its lightweight, fibrous wood, which has been historically used for various purposes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in humid, tropical environments. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
