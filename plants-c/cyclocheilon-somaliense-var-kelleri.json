    "intro": "Cyclocheilon somaliense var. kelleri, commonly known as the Somali cyclocheilon, is a rare and unique plant species native to the arid regions of Somalia. It is characterized by its compact, succulent growth form and thick, fleshy leaves adapted for water storage. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that bloom in the early morning, often in response to brief periods of rainfall. Its botanical structure reflects its adaptation to extreme environmental conditions, with a deep root system and reduced leaf surface area. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
