    "intro": "Carex villosa, commonly known as hairy sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, produce small, green to brownish flowers. Carex villosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
