    "intro": "Craspedaria fuscopunctata, commonly known as the black-spotted liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It is a small, thalloid liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a dorsiventral thallus with distinct lobes and a central groove, and its surface is often covered with small, black or dark-colored dots, which are reproductive structures called gemmae. Craspedaria fuscopunctata reproduces both sexually through spores and asexually via gemmae, which are dispersed by water or wind. It plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its habitat."
