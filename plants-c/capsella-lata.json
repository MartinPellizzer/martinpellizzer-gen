    "intro": "Capsella lata, commonly known as the broadleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family, which includes many species of flowering plants characterized by their trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, while its flowers are usually blue or purple and bloom in the early morning. Capsella lata is often found in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
