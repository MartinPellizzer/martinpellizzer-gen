    "intro": "Convallaria majalis subspecioid tetraploidiae, commonly known as the tetraploid lily of the valley, is a variant of the traditional lily of the valley plant. It is characterized by its tetraploid genome, which results in larger, more robust flowers compared to its diploid relatives. This subspecioid exhibits distinct morphological features, including thicker stems and broader leaves. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland areas with moist, well-drained soil. Due to its unique genetic makeup, it is of interest in botanical studies on polyploidy and hybridization."
