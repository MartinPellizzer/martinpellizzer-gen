    "intro": "Carex inaequalis, commonly known as the unequal sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it produces viable seeds that contribute to its ecological role in wetland habitats. Carex inaequalis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
