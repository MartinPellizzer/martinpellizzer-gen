    "intro": "Catalpa cassinoides, commonly known as the northern catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The tree produces long, bean-like pods that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in moist woodland areas. Catalpa cassinoides is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional medicine."
