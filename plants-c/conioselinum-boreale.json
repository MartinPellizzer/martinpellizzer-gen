    "intro": "Conioselinum boreale, commonly known as Arctic wormseed, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing herbaceous plant with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Conioselinum boreale plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for local wildlife in its harsh native environment."
