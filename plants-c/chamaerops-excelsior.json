    "intro": "Chamaerops excelsior, commonly known as the windmill palm, is a species of palm native to the Mediterranean region. It is a small, cold-hardy palm that typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters. The plant has a slender trunk with a distinctive crown of stiff, fan-shaped leaves that resemble the blades of a windmill. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. Chamaerops excelsior is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in mild climates."
