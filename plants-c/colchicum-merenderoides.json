    "intro": "Colchicum merenderoides, commonly known as the Merendero colchicum, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Colchicaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a bulbous corm, which serves as its storage organ and allows it to survive in harsh, cold environments. Its leaves are basal, strap-like, and often remain green throughout the year. The flowers are typically purple or violet in color, with reflexed petals that give it a unique appearance."
