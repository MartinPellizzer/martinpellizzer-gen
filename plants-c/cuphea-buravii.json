    "intro": "Cuphea buravii, commonly known as the Buru cuphea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure. Cuphea buravii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms and drought tolerance."
