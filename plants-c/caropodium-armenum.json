    "intro": "Caropodium armenum, commonly known as Armenian moss, is a small, mat-forming liverwort found in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Pottioideae and is characterized by its delicate, leaf-like structures called thallus. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a simple, flattened body that absorbs water and nutrients directly. It typically grows on rocks, soil, or decaying wood in temperate regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
