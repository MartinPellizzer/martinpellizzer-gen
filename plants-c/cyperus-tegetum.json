    "intro": "Cyperus tegetum, commonly known as the marsh clubmoss, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters, typical of many Cyperaceae species. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in moist soils. Cyperus tegetum is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
