    "intro": "Calcareoboea, commonly known as the limestone boea, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to red. The plant thrives in calcareous soils, which are rich in calcium carbonate, and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Its leaves are typically opposite and lance-shaped, with a rough texture. Calcareoboea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
