    "intro": "Carex pediformis subsp. rhizina, commonly known as the purple stem sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Botanically, it is notable for its distinctive purple-tinged stems and its role in stabilizing soil in aquatic habitats."
