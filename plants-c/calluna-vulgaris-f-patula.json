It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and moorlands. Its leaves are needle-like and remain green throughout the year, contributing to its ornamental value. It is valued in horticulture for its ability to form thick, mat-like ground cover and its adaptability to various environmental conditions."
