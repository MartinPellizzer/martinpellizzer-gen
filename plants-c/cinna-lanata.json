    "intro": "Cinna lanata, commonly known as woolly cinquefoil, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Cinna lanata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
