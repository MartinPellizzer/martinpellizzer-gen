    "intro": "Cereus euchlorus subsp. leucanthus, commonly known as the white-flowered night blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are typically ribbed and covered in sparse, white spines. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its flowering period occurs primarily during the warmer months, and it is well adapted to survive in dry, hot environments. The subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in cactus gardens."
