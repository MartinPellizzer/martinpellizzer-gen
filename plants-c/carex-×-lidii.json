    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 lidii, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Carex brevicula and Carex scoparia, making it a fascinating example of natural hybridization. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wetlands, where it forms dense clumps of grass-like foliage. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and it produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. While it does not produce viable seeds, it is valued in wetland restoration projects for its ecological role and aesthetic appeal."
