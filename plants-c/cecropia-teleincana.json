    "intro": "Cecropia teleincana, commonly known as the giant cecropia, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and unique, hollow stems. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship with ants, which reside in the hollow stems and provide protection against herbivores. Its rapid growth rate and ability to thrive in disturbed habitats make it a significant component of secondary forests. The plant also plays a role in providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
