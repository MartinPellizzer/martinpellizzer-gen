    "intro": "Cotoneaster encavei, commonly known as the cave cotoneaster, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable ornamental plant in gardens. Its compact size and seasonal color changes make it a popular choice for hedging and landscape design."
