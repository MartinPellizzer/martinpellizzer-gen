    "intro": "Cordia rothschuhii, commonly known as the desert cordia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and showy, pink to red flowers. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in sandy or rocky soils. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it plays a role in providing food for local wildlife. Cordia rothschuhii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
