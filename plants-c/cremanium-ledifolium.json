    "intro": "Cremanium ledifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf cremanium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
