    "intro": "Cynosurus eruciformis, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, hair-covered stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, flat, and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Cynosurus eruciformis is typically found in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often in meadows or along stream banks."
