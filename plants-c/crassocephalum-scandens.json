    "intro": "Crassocephalum scandens, commonly known as the creeping oxeye or bush morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a vigorous vine that produces small, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive, broad, rounded shape. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and gardens. It is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in traditional medicine."
