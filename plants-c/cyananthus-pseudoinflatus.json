    "intro": "Cyananthus pseudoinflatus, commonly known as the inflated bluebell, is a striking member of the Boraginaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its showy, sky-blue flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of its slender stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy layer of hairs, which helps to retain moisture. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
