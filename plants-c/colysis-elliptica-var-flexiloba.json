    "intro": "Colysis elliptica var. flexiloba, commonly known as the flexible elliptic colysis, is a lesser-known species within the Colysis genus. It is characterized by its elliptical, often waxy leaves that exhibit a flexible structure, allowing it to adapt to various environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity. Its leaves are usually dark green with a slightly textured surface, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and not widely cultivated."
