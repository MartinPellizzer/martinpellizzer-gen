    "intro": "Crupina vulgaris subsp. crupinastrum, commonly known as sea holly, is a coastal plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant features blue to purple flowers that bloom from summer to autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. It is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes."
