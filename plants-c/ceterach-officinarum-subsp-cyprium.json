    "intro": "Ceterach officinarum subsp. cyprium, commonly known as the coastal ceterach, is a perennial flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and bluish-green, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and cliffs. Due to its ability to tolerate salt spray and strong winds, it plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
