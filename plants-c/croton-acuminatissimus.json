    "intro": "Croton acuminatissimus, commonly known as the African croton, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically lobed and have a distinctive, often hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland forest areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
