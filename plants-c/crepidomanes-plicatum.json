    "intro": "Crepidomanes plicatum, commonly known as the pleated bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often pleated or folded, which contributes to its common name. Crepidomanes plicatum is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the nutrients obtained from captured prey."
