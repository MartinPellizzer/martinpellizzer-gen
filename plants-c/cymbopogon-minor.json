    "intro": "Cymbopogon minor, commonly known as lemon grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like appearance with narrow, aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically green or pale blue in color. Lemon grass is widely cultivated for its essential oils, which are extracted from its stalks and used in aromatherapy and culinary applications. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense clumps in suitable conditions."
