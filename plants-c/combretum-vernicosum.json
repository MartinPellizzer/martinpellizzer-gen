    "intro": "Combretum vernicosum, commonly known as the rough-leaved flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, flaky bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy areas. Combretum vernicosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
