    "intro": "Cyphokentia heanei, commonly known as the Heane's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the island of Tonga in the South Pacific. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native region. Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an important subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
