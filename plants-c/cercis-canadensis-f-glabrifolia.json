It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves that are typically oval to elliptical in shape. The plant produces striking red to purple flowers in early spring, which are clustered in pendulous inflorescences. Its foliage turns vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall, making it a popular ornamental plant. The smoothleaf red maple is adapted to a variety of soil types and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
