    "intro": "Convolvulus pes-tigridis, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual with slender, twining stems that climb using its tendrils. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, blooming in the early morning. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The seeds are encased in a fibrous, spiral-shaped capsule that aids in wind dispersal."
