    "intro": "Cereus goebelianus, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, nocturnal flowers that open at night. Its stems are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments."
