    "intro": "Convolvulus saltii, commonly known as the saltbush convolvulus, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has adapted to saline and drought-prone environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions. Its leaves are typically small and hairy, which helps reduce water loss. Convolvulus saltii is often found growing in sandy soils along the edges of salt marshes and coastal dunes."
