    "intro": "Chilopsis, commonly known as the desert willow, is a genus of flowering plants native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The leaves are typically opposite, simple, and often have a bluish-green hue with a fuzzy texture. The flowers, which bloom in spring and summer, come in shades of yellow, orange, or red, attracting bees and other pollinators. Chilopsis species are drought-tolerant and thrive in well-drained soils, making them suitable for xeriscaping in arid environments."
