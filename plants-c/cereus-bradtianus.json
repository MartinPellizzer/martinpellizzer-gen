    "intro": "Cereus bradtianus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to South America. It is a spiny, columnar cactus that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and dark green, waxy leaves that are often modified into spines. It produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The flowers are short-lived, lasting only a single night, which makes the plant a striking example of night-blooming flora."
