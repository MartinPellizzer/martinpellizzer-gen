    "intro": "Carex muricata var. sterilis, commonly known as the sterile spike sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded environments in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces compact, spike-like inflorescences that are typically sterile, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in wetland gardens and restoration projects."
