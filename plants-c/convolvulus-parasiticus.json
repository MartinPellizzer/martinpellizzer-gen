    "intro": "Convolvulus parasiticus, commonly known as the parasitic bindweed, is a flowering plant that exhibits parasitic behavior, attaching itself to host plants to derive nutrients. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its yellow or orange flowers and twining stems. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures for photosynthesis. It primarily infests shrubs and trees, often causing stress to the host by draining its resources. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a weed in many regions."
