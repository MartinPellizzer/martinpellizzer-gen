    "intro": "Columbia evecta, commonly known as the Columbia lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks that can reach up to six feet in height, supporting large, showy white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in mountain meadows and forest clearings. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense basal rosette. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Columbia evecta is considered a vulnerable species."
