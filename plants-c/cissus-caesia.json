It is characterized by its trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil. Cissus caesia is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
