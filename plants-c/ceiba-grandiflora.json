    "intro": "Ceiba grandiflora, commonly known as the silk cotton tree, is a large, deciduous tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its massive, buttressed trunk and umbrella-shaped canopy, which can reach heights of up to 40 meters. The tree produces showy, white, woolly flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by large, round, cotton-like seed pods. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a distinctive flaky texture, and it has a deep root system that helps stabilize soil. The plant is also valued for its timber and is often found in tropical dry forests and savannas."
