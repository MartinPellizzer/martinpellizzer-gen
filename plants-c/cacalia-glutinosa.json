    "intro": "Cacalia glutinosa, commonly known as sticky bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers. The plant produces small, cylindrical fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded units when mature. Its leaves are finely divided and often have a sticky texture, giving the plant its common name. Cacalia glutinosa thrives in moist, woodsy environments and is often found in shaded or partially shaded areas."
