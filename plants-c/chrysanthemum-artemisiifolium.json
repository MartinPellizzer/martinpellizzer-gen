    "intro": "Chrysanthemum artemisiifolium, commonly known as the goat's beard chrysanthemum, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble those of the Artemisia genus, giving it its species name. The plant produces showy, daisy-like yellow to orange flowers in the autumn. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
