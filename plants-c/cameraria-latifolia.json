    "intro": "Cameraria latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf leafminer, is a species of moth whose larvae feed on the leaves of various plants. The plant itself is not a true plant but rather the host plant for this insect, with the larvae creating distinctive mines within the foliage. It is typically found in temperate regions and thrives in environments with moderate humidity and temperature. The leaves of the host plant are often broad and flat, providing an ideal surface for the leafminers to develop. This species plays a role in ecological interactions, contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as a food source for other organisms."
