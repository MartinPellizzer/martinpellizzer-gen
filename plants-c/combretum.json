    "intro": "Combretum, commonly known as the \"comb-wood\" or \"branched-wood,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lythraceae. It consists of over 300 species, predominantly found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plants are characterized by their distinctive, often serrated leaves and showy, clustered flowers that range from white to red. Many species of Combretum are shrubs or small trees, with some having a woody, branching structure that gives them their common name. They are often used in traditional medicine and for their ornamental value due to their vibrant blooms and unique foliage."
