It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.
