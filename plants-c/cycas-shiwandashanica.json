    "intro": "Cycas shiwandashanica, commonly known as the Shiwandashan cycas, is a rare cycad species native to China. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male cones appearing at the base of the plant and female cones at the top. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a subtropical climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat degradation, it is considered endangered."
