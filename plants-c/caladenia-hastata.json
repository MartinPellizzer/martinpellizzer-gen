    "intro": "Caladenia hastata, commonly known as the Narrow-leafed Spider-orchid, is an Australian orchid species characterized by its slender, erect stems and distinctive, spider-like flowers. It typically grows in heathlands and open forests, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces a single, pale yellow to greenish-yellow flower with a prominent, hooded labellum. Its flowering period occurs during the late winter to spring, and it is often found in the south-eastern regions of Australia. Caladenia hastata is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological specificity."
