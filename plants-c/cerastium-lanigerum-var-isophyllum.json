It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, silver-green leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and border plantings."
