    "intro": "Cerasus juliana var. rotundata, commonly known as the Japanese apricot or dwarf Japanese apricot, is a compact, ornamental cherry tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The fruit is typically small, sweet, and edible, though it is often grown more for its ornamental value than for its yield. This variety is prized for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in a variety of climates. It is also noted for its resistance to many common cherry tree diseases."
