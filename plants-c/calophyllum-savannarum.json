    "intro": "Calophyllum savannarum, commonly known as the yellow mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark and bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in coastal areas, particularly in brackish water environments, and is adapted to withstand salt spray and periodic flooding. Its fruits are small, woody capsules that contain seeds dispersed by water. The tree plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
