It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, serrated leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
