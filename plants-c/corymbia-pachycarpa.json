    "intro": "Corymbia pachycarpa, commonly known as the broad-leafed ghost gum, is a species of flowering tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and lance-shaped, glossy green leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, typically in summer. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. This plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystem."
