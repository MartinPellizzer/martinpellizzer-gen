    "intro": "Cineraria unctuosa, commonly known as the sticky cineraria, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its woolly, silver-green foliage and showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in spring. The plant belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies. Its hairy leaves help reduce water loss, making it adapted to dry, coastal environments. The plant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance and resilience."
