    "intro": "Cymbalariella sibthorpii, commonly known as the Sibthorp's cymbalariella, is a small, flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly in regions of Namibia and South Africa. The plant features delicate, umbel-like inflorescences composed of small white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other members of the carrot family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species among botanists."
