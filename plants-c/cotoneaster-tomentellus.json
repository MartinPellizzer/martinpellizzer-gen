    "intro": "Cotoneaster tomentellus, commonly known as the woolly cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine, woolly coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. Cotoneaster tomentellus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and hardiness in cooler climates."
