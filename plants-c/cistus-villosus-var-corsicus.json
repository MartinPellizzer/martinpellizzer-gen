    "intro": "Cistus villosus var. corsicus, commonly known as the Corsican rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia. It is characterized by its gray-green, woolly foliage and clusters of pink to pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to arid and coastal environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional herbal medicine."
