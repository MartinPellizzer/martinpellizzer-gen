It is a shrub characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant exhibits a unique floral structure with cross-shaped petals, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a humid climate with partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
