    "intro": "Cleistes angeliana, commonly known as the angel's cleistocarp, is a rare and striking member of the Oenotheraceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is notable for its unique, urn-shaped flowers that remain closed for most of the year, only opening briefly during specific times. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to greenish-white, with a distinct, fragrant scent. Cleistes angeliana is also characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and a short, hairy stem."
