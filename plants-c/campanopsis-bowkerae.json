    "intro": "Campanopsis bowkerae, commonly known as the Hawaiian bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant native to the island of Hawaii. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Campanopsis bowkerae is considered a vulnerable species."
