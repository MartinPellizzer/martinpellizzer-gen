    "intro": "Catalpa communis, commonly known as the common catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The tree produces long, cylindrical seed pods that split open to release its winged seeds. Catalpa communis is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in open woods. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping."
