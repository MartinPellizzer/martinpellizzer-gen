    "intro": "Cespedesia excelsa, commonly known as silver sword, is a perennial grass native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and narrow, silver-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in panicles, which are typically white or pale green. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Cespedesia excelsa is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in coastal and sandy environments."
