    "intro": "Coincya puberula, commonly known as the velvet moss, is a small, mat-forming liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a dense, cushion-like growth pattern with soft, velvety leaves that are covered in tiny, hair-like structures. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense, instead having specialized structures called thalli. It reproduces through spores, which are released from small, cup-like structures called gametophores. Coincya puberula is often found in forest floors, rock crevices, and along streams, contributing to soil stabilization and moisture retention."
