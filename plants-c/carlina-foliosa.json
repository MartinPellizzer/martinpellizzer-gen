    "intro": "Carlina foliosa, commonly known as the leafy cudweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. The plant features basal rosettes of elongated, hairy leaves and produces showy, dandelion-like yellow flowers in late summer. Its flowers are surrounded by a series of bracts that form a distinctive cup-like structure. Carlina foliosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential health benefits."
