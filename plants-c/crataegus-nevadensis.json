It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, including rocky slopes and desert regions. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated edges, and it has a generally compact growth habit. The Nevada hawthorn is adapted to low moisture conditions and is often found in xeric landscapes."
