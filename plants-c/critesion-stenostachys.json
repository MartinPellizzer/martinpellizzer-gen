    "intro": "Critesion stenostachys, commonly known as the narrow-stalked grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. It is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and disturbed soils. Critesion stenostachys is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
