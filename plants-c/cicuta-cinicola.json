    "intro": "Cicuta cinicola, commonly known as water hemlock, is a highly toxic member of the parsley family (Apiaceae). It is a flowering plant that typically grows in wetland areas, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white to greenish flowers. The plant contains potent toxins, primarily cicutoxin, which can cause severe poisoning in both humans and animals. It is often mistaken for edible plants like water parsley, leading to accidental ingestion. Due to its extreme toxicity, Cicuta cinicola is considered one of the most dangerous plants in North America."
