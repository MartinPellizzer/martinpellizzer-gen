    "intro": "Camellia jinshajiangica, commonly known as the Yunnan camellia, is a species native to China, particularly found in the Yunnan province. It is a deciduous shrub that can grow up to 3 meters tall, featuring broad, leathery leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces striking red or pink flowers in the winter and early spring, which are composed of numerous petals and are highly ornamental. Camellia jinshajiangica is also valued for its potential in horticulture and as a source of tea leaves, though it is less commonly cultivated than other camellia species."
