It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Cujunia is native to regions in the Americas and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
