    "intro": "Centaurea lugdunensis, commonly known as the Lyon's thistle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking purple-blue flower heads that resemble thistles. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, and it produces small, bract-like structures around its central flower. Centaurea lugdunensis thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and rocky habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
