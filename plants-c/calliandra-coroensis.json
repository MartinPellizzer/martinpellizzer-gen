    "intro": "Calliandra coroensis, commonly known as the coral tree, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height, characterized by its bright red or orange floral clusters. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. Calliandra coroensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
