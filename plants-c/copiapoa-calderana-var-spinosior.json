    "intro": "Copiapoa calderana var. spinosior, commonly known as the spiny copiapoa, is a cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and dense clusters of spines, which provide protection against herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Due to its striking appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
