    "intro": "Caralluma forsskalii, commonly known as the devil's tongue or desert fig, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and India. It is characterized by its fleshy, spineless stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and later develops red, fleshy fruits that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, reducing water loss through transpiration. Caralluma forsskalii is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and extreme temperatures."
