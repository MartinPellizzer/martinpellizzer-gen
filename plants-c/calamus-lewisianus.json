    "intro": "Calamus lewisianus, commonly known as Lewis' canes or the zigzag sedge, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often exhibit a zigzag pattern, a feature that helps it resist wind damage. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Calamus lewisianus is often found in marshy areas and is adapted to thrive in saturated soil conditions."
