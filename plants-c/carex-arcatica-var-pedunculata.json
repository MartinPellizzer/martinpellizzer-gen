    "intro": "Carex arcatica var. pedunculata, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as bogs, fens, and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, three-lobed flowers. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils. This variant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its tolerance of wet conditions and ability to stabilize soil."
