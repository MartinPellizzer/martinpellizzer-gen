    "intro": "Coelogyne ramosii, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters along the stem.

Its leaves are strap-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its aesthetic appeal. Coelogyne ramosii thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
