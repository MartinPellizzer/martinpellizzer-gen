    "intro": "Chenopodium album subf. paucidens, commonly known as prickly goosefoot, is an annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its prostrate or upright growth habit, with succulent, often spiny stems and alternate leaves that are broadly ovate to rhombic in shape. The small, greenish-yellow flowers are borne in dense clusters, and the plant produces minute, dry fruits called utricles. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. This species is known for its adaptability and is considered a common weed in agricultural settings."
