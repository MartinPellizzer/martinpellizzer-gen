It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and smaller, more compact fruit compared to typical cherry varieties. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and has been cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruit. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun exposure, making it suitable for temperate climates. Its flowers are white and fragrant, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge."
