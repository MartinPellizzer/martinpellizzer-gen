    "intro": "Cuscuta epithymum var. subulata, commonly known as the slender dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has thread-like stems that wrap around its host to extract water and nutrients. The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its life cycle involves producing seeds that can remain dormant in the soil for years. Due to its parasitic nature, it can be a problematic weed in agricultural settings."
