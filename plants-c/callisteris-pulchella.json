    "intro": "Callisteris pulchella, commonly known as the Mexican feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, tufted clumps of dark green foliage and delicate, feathery seed heads that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its elegant appearance and ability to provide winter interest. Callisteris pulchella is also valued for its role in stabilizing soils and supporting local wildlife."
