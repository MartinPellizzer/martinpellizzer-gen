It features fine, silvery-blue foliage that turns coppery in the fall, providing year-round ornamental interest. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or white flowers in the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking hardy, ornamental plants."
