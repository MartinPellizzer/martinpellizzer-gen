    "intro": "Clematis flammula var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered yellow clematis, is a deciduous vine native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, woody stems that twine around supports and produce clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three ovate to lanceolate leaflets with serrated edges. The plant prefers partial shade to full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens or as a climbing plant in shrub beds. Its rapid growth and showy blooms make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
