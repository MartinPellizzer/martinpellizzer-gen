    "intro": "Cephalorrhynchus brassicifolius, commonly known as the brassica-leaved headroot, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its unique rosette-shaped foliage, which consists of thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in late spring. Its root system is particularly robust, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
