It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to climb using its tendrils. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in open fields.
