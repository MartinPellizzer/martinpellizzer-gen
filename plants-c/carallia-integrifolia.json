    "intro": "Carallia integrifolia, commonly known as the coastal bluebells, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a member of the Violaceae family, characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves with smooth, entire margins. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline, often growing in open, sun-exposed areas. Carallia integrifolia is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient and distinctive part of the local flora."
