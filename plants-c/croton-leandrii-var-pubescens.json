    "intro": "Croton leandrii var. pubescens, commonly known as the woolly croton, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its vibrant, multicolored foliage. Its leaves are typically large, broad, and often display a mix of green, red, and yellow hues, with a fuzzy, pubescent texture that gives it its common name. The plant is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by woody, spiky fruits. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded outdoor gardens."
