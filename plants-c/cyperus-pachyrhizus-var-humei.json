    "intro": "Cyperus pachyrhizus var. humei, commonly known as the broadroot sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wet or marshy habitats, often forming dense vegetation in wetlands and along water bodies. Its rhizomes contribute to its ability to spread vegetatively and stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
