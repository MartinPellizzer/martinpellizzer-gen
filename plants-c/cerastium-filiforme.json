    "intro": "Cerastium filiforme, commonly known as slender mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its fine, thread-like stems and small, hairy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are typically arranged in racemes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Cerastium filiforme is often found in temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia."
