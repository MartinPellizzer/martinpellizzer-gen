    "intro": "Coryanthes horichiana, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, intricate flower structure that resembles a ghostly face, hence its common name. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, which are adapted to grow on tree trunks. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that aids in pollination by specific insects. Due to its habitat specificity and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
