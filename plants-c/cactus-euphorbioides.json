    "intro": "Cactus euphorbioides, commonly known as the wooly cactus, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features a cylindrical stem covered in dense, white, woolly hair that helps reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its fuzzy foliage. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water to survive. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
