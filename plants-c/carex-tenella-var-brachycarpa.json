    "intro": "Carex tenella var. brachycarpa, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features dense, grass-like foliage that forms compact clumps, with narrow, dark green leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes, which are often hidden among the foliage, and it is often found in moist, shady environments such as woodlands or stream banks. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wet or boggy soils. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy and adaptable plant suitable for both natural and cultivated landscapes."
