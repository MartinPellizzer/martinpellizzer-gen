    "intro": "Carex granularis var. recta, commonly known as the straight-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, consist of small, greenish-brown flowers that are wind-pollinated. Carex granularis var. recta is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
