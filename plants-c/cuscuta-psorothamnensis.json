    "intro": "Cuscuta psorothamnensis, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, thread-like stem that wraps around its host. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is often found parasitizing shrubs and grasses, contributing to the decline of its host. Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a unique role in desert ecosystems."
