It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often opening in the morning. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
