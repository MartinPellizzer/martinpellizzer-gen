    "intro": "Cheilanthes deboeri, commonly known as the Deboer's rockcap, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a terrestrial, epiphytic, or lithophytic plant, typically found growing on rocks or tree trunks in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with clustered, leathery, and often hairy fronds. Its spores are produced in sori that are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Cheilanthes deboeri is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient and interesting subject for botanical study."
