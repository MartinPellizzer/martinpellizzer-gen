    "intro": "Calanthe versteegii, commonly known as the Versteeg's calanthe, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to anchor itself in rocky or soil substrates. Calanthe versteegii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its beauty."
