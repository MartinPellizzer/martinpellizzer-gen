    "intro": "Cytisus pygmaeus var. calcareus, commonly known as the limestone broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in calcareous soils, which are rich in limestone, and is adapted to rocky or gravelly habitats. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, elliptical leaflets, and it is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
