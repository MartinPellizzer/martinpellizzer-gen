    "intro": "Cydista aequinoctialis var. sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping cydista, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a slightly hairy texture. This variety is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
