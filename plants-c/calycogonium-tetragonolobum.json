    "intro": "Calycogonium tetragonolobum, commonly known as the four-lobed calycogonium, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive four-lobed calyx that persists on the fruit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the wild."
