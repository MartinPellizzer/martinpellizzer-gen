    "intro": "Cereus knippelianus, commonly known as the knippelianus cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers at night, which are typically short-lived but striking in appearance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. This cactus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
