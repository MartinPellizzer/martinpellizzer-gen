    "intro": "Callitriche hermaphroditica subsp. clausonis, commonly known as the Clauson's water-starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. The plant is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, ribbon-like leaves. It is a dioecious species, meaning that male and female flowers are found on separate plants. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and often submerged or floating at the water's surface."
