    "intro": "Cedrela mollis, commonly known as the red cedar or yellowheart, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark, durable wood and is often found in lowland rainforests. The plant has compound leaves that are alternate and pinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elongated, woody fruits. Cedrela mollis is valued for its ornamental and timber qualities, though its populations are threatened by deforestation."
