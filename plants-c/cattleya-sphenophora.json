    "intro": "Cattleya sphenophora, commonly known as the narrow-leafed cattleya, is a species of orchid native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and the production of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention. Its flowers typically bloom in clusters, with a distinctive lip that is often marked with contrasting color patterns. Cattleya sphenophora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and adaptability to cultivated environments."
