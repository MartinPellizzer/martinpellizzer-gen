    "intro": "Cenchrus longifolius, commonly known as the longleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
