    "intro": "Cymbopogon bhutanicus, commonly known as Bhutanese lemongrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Bhutan. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and aromatic, lemon-scented leaves that are widely used in traditional medicine and culinary practices. The plant belongs to the Poaceae family and is closely related to other lemongrass species such as Cymbopogon citratus. Its essential oils, rich in citral and other terpenes, contribute to its medicinal properties and distinctive fragrance. The botanical features of Cymbopogon bhutanicus make it a valuable resource in both local and global herbal applications."
