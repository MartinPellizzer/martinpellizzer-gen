    "intro": "Cryptandra miliaris var. lasiophylla, commonly known as the woolly cryptandra, is a small shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers during the cooler months, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to the harsh, dry conditions of its native habitat."
