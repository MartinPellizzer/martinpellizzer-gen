    "intro": "Cephalophyllum parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered headplant, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It features a distinctive rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Its compact size and unusual appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival."
