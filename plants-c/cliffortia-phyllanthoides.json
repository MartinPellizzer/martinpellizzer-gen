    "intro": "Cliffortia phyllanthoides, commonly known as the Cape sugarbush, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. The plant features narrow, leathery leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in spring, which are followed by orange or red berries. Cliffortia phyllanthoides is well adapted to dry conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
