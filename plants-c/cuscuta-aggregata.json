    "intro": "Cuscuta aggregata, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is widespread in North America and can be found growing on a variety of plants, including grasses and shrubs. Its seeds are dispersed by wind and can remain viable in the soil for many years. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
