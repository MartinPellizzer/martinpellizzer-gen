    "intro": "Carex pediformis f. pododactyla, commonly known as the foot-shaped sedge, is a variant of the pediform sedge characterized by its unique leaf morphology. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and along stream banks, where it thrives in full to partial sunlight. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often exhibit a distinctive foot-like shape at the base, giving it its common name. The inflorescence consists of a spike of small, three-ranked spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates and small aquatic organisms."
