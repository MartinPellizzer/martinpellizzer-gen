    "intro": "Cassytha pubescens, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue or violet in color, blooming throughout the warmer months. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. Cassytha pubescens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands."
