    "intro": "Cymbopogon microthecus, commonly known as lemon grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often used in culinary and aromatic applications. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences and is known for its strong, lemony scent due to the presence of citral and other essential oils. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Cymbopogon microthecus is widely cultivated for its medicinal and culinary uses, as well as for its ornamental value."
