    "intro": "Cedrus deodara var. fastigiata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved deodar cedar, is a compact, coniferous evergreen with a columnar growth habit. It features scale-like leaves that are tightly pressed against the branches, giving it a dense, feathery appearance. The plant produces male and female cones, with the female cones developing into woody, elongated seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a specimen plant. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
