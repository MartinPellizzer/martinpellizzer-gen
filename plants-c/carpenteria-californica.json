It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular red or pink flowers that bloom from late summer into early winter. The plant has woody stems and thrives in well-drained soils, often growing in sunlit, coastal environments. Its nectar-rich flowers are an important food source for hummingbirds and other pollinators. Carpenteria californica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping."
