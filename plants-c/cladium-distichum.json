    "intro": "Cladium distichum, commonly known as the sawgrass, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of the Americas. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often ribbed and have a grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow water or swampy areas, forming dense mats that help stabilize the soil. Its inflorescence consists of small, clustered spikes of greenish flowers that develop into dark, round berries. Cladium distichum plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
