    "intro": "Caesalpinia hintonii, commonly known as the Hinton's glorybower, is a striking tropical shrub or small tree native to Central America. It is characterized by its bright yellow and red bract-based inflorescences, which resemble plumes and are highly visible during the flowering season. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. Caesalpinia hintonii thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates."
