    "intro": "Columbia curtisii, commonly known as the Curtis's columbia, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant white flowers and lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along streams. It has a short growing season and is highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
