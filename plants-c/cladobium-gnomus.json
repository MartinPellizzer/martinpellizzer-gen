    "intro": "Cladobium gnomus, commonly known as the desert star cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a distinctive, spiny, globular stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration. Cladobium gnomus is adapted to extreme heat and drought, making it a hardy species for xerophytic landscapes."
