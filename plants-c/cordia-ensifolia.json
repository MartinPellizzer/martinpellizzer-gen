    "intro": "Cordia ensifolia, commonly known as the swordleaf cordia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by orange to red berries containing several seeds. Cordia ensifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, and it is also valued for its ornamental appeal in landscaping. Its adaptability to various soil types and drought tolerance make it a resilient plant in tropical and subtropical environments."
