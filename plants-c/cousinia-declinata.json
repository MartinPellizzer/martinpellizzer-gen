    "intro": "Cousinia declinata, commonly known as the cliff's cottonweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, fluffy white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found growing on slopes or cliffs. Cousinia declinata is well adapted to dry conditions and is a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping in arid landscapes."
