    "intro": "Cuphea ericoides var. juniperifolia, commonly known as the Juniperleaf Cuphea, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which has a leathery texture and a bluish-green hue, resembling juniper leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular red or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
