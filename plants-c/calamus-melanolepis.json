    "intro": "Calamus melanolepis, commonly known as black-stemmed arrowroot, is a member of the Arecaceae family, native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its tall, slender stems and broad, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, starchy rhizomes that are used in traditional cuisine. Its rhizomes are valued for their high starch content and are often processed into flour or used as a thickening agent. Calamus melanolepis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests."
