    "intro": "Codonanthe formicarum, commonly known as the firecracker flower, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially sunbirds, due to their shape and nectar content. Codonanthe formicarum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
