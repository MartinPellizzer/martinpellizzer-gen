    "intro": "Crepis biennis var. runcinata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mouse-ear, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and small, yellowish composite flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is found in temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It has a fibrous root system and produces achenes that are dispersed by wind. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to colonize disturbed sites."
