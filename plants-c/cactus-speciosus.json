    "intro": "Cactus speciosus, commonly known as the showy cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to red, typically blooming in the spring. Its spines are modified leaves that provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. Cactus speciosus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in xerophytic gardens."
