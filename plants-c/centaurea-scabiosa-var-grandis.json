    "intro": "Centaurea scabiosa var. grandis, commonly known as the greater knapweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and striking purple to pink flower heads that resemble small, spiked globes. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces seeds in a fluffy, white pappus that aids in wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Centaurea scabiosa var. grandis is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
