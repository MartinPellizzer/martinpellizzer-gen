It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a deep root system, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for erosion control. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it beneficial for soil fertility in agricultural settings."
