    "intro": "Coryphantha daimonoceras, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with pale green to bluish-green stems that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its stems are ribbed and have areoles, which are specialized structures that bear the plant's characteristic spines and flowers. Coryphantha daimonoceras is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in dry conditions."
