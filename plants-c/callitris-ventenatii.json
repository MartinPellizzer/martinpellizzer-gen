    "intro": "Callitris ventenatii, commonly known as the coastal or sand pine, is a species of coniferous tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and dense, needle-like foliage. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is well adapted to arid and saline environments. Callitris ventenatii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
