    "intro": "Carex gaudichaudiana subsp. appendiculata, commonly known as the clustered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, greenish flowers that are clustered at the ends of its stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The subspecies appendiculata is characterized by its distinctive inflorescence structure and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
