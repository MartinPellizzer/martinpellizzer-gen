    "intro": "Casuarina paludosa, commonly known as the swamp she-oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to coastal and wetland areas of eastern Australia. It has slender, needle-like leaves that are often mistaken for those of coniferous trees, and it produces small, woody cones that contain the seeds. The plant is adapted to saline and waterlogged soils, making it a common species in mangrove and salt marsh ecosystems. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for various wildlife species and stabilizing coastal soils."
