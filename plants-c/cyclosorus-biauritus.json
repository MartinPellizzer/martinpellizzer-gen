    "intro": "Cyclosorus biauritus, commonly known as the two-auricle water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Onocleaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are divided into two distinct auricles, or ear-like lobes, giving it its common name. The plant typically thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its fronds are usually light green and possess a feathery, intricate structure typical of ferns. Cyclosorus biauritus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality through its filtration abilities."
