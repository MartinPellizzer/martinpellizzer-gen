    "intro": "Cirsium canum subsp. pannonicum, commonly known as the Pannonian thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe. It typically grows in dry grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. It has a robust root system and can form dense colonies, making it a common weed in disturbed areas. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly shorter and broader leaves compared to the typical C. canum."
