    "intro": "Coffea coriacea, commonly known as the rough coffee or African coffee, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its rough, bark-like texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds used for coffee production. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a leathery texture and are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Coffea coriacea is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth."
