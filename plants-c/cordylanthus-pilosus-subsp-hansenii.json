    "intro": "Cordylanthus pilosus subsp. hansenii, commonly known as Hansen's woolly stickseed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which are typically covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments with limited water availability."
