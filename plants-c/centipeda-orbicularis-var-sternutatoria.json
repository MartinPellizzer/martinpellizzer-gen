    "intro": "Centipeda orbicularis var. sternutatoria, commonly known as the sneezeweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wet meadows, ditches, and along stream banks. The plant's common name originates from its ability to induce sneezing when its leaves are rubbed against the skin."
