    "intro": "Cynanchum amplexicaule var. castaneum, commonly known as the red milkweed vine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and the presence of milky sap, which is a common feature among plants in the Asclepiadaceae family. The leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and often have a velvety texture, while the flowers are clustered in umbels and range in color from pink to red. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and disturbed areas. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
