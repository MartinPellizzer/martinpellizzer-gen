    "intro": "Cotoneaster subacutus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, upright branches with thorny tips. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by bright red berries that persist into winter. Its leaves are elliptical, with a pointed tip and a smooth, glossy surface. Cotoneaster subacutus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
