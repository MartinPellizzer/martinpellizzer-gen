    "intro": "Cycniopsis humifusa, commonly known as the groundsel or yellow groundsel, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides, often forming dense mats. Its leaves are alternate, rough to the touch, and have a distinctive heart-shaped base. The flowers bloom in the spring and are followed by small, dry fruits called achenes."
