    "intro": "Carex pseudohumilis, commonly known as the low sedges, is a species of sedge native to parts of North America. It typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has grass-like leaves that are usually narrow and dark green, with a distinctive triangular cross-section. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Carex pseudohumilis plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
