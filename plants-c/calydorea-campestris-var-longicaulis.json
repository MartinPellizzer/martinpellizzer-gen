    "intro": "Calydorea campestris var. longicaulis, commonly known as the long-stemmed marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often with a fibrous root system adapted to waterlogged soils. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often forming dense foliage at the base. It is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland biodiversity."
