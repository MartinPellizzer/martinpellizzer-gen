    "intro": "Collomia longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered collomia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family, characterized by its hairy stems and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in open woodlands or along streambanks. Its flowers are tubular with five spreading lobes, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Collomia longiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
