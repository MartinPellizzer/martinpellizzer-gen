    "intro": "Condylopodium pennellii, commonly known as the Florida panther lichen, is a unique lichen that exhibits a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga. It is characterized by its crust-like growth form, which adheres tightly to rock surfaces, typically in humid, shaded environments. The thallus is usually pale green to yellowish in color, and it lacks distinct lobes or rhizines. This lichen is often found in the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and parts of Georgia. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of ecological health."
