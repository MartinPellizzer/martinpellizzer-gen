    "intro": "Castilleja elkoensis, commonly known as the Elko milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. It produces bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its unique botanical features make it an important component of its ecosystem and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
