    "intro": "Chassalia kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu chassalia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Borneo, particularly found in the area around Mount Kinabalu. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within the tropical rainforest canopy. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a velvety texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in a cylindrical shape. Chassalia kinabaluensis is notable for its limited distribution and is considered a rare species due to habitat specificity and environmental threats."
