It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern along its stem. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often greenish-white in color, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Cyclosorus cyrtocaulos plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
