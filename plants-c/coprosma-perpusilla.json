    "intro": "Coprosma perpusilla, commonly known as the silver coprosma, is a small evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy green on top and silver-white underneath, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for native birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Coprosma perpusilla is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in its native habitat."
