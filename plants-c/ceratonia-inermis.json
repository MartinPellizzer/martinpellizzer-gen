    "intro": "Ceratonia inermis, commonly known as the white carob tree, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a leathery texture. The tree produces long, slender pods that contain edible seeds surrounded by a sweet, sticky pulp. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to arid environments. The plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
