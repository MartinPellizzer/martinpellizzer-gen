    "intro": "Crataegus oxyacantha var. granatensis, commonly known as the Granatense hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits in the autumn, which are edible but often used in jams and wines. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for hedging and ornamental gardening."
