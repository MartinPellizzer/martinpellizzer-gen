    "intro": "Campsis amboinensis, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fiery orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has opposite, simple, and ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a tendency to flake off in small pieces. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
