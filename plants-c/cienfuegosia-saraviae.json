    "intro": "Cienfuegosia saraviae, commonly known as the Saravia's cienfuegosia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, adapting to the harsh conditions of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
