    "intro": "Cyperus macrolepis, commonly known as the broadleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically found in clusters at the base of the leaves. Cyperus macrolepis thrives in wetland environments, including marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its adaptability to moist soils makes it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
