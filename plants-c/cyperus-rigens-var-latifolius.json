    "intro": "Cyperus rigens var. latifolius, commonly known as broadleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features grass-like leaves that are broad and flat, with a distinctive silver-gray sheen on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas, pond edges, and along streams. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common weed in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
