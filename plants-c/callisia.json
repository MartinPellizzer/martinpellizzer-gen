These plants are native to the Americas and are characterized by their trailing growth habit and small, clustered flowers. Many species of Callisia are popular as ornamental plants due to their attractive foliage and ease of care. They typically thrive in well-draining soil and prefer bright, indirect light. Some species are also known for their ability to produce offsets, making them easy to propagate."
