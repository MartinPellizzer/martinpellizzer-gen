It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to greenish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows or along the edges of water bodies. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
