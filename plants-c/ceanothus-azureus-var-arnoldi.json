It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with dry summers and wet winters. The plant features narrow, silvery-gray leaves and produces fragrant, curling blossoms that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. However, it can be sensitive to frost and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
