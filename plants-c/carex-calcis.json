    "intro": "Carex calcis, commonly known as the limestone sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to calcareous soils. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained environments and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Carex calcis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
