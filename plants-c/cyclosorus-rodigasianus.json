    "intro": "Cyclosorus rodigasianus, commonly known as the rodigasian shield fern, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and unique, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. Native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. Its rhizome system is robust, allowing it to anchor itself in rocky or forested substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclosorus rodigasianus is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
