    "intro": "Chrysitrix subteres, commonly known as the underground chrysanthemum, is a rare and elusive plant species characterized by its subterranean growth habit. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is notable for its lack of visible above-ground foliage, with all its vegetative structures remaining hidden beneath the soil surface. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that emerge only briefly during specific environmental conditions, making it difficult to observe in the wild. Its unique biology makes it an intriguing subject for botanical research, particularly in understanding subterranean plant adaptations. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Chrysitrix subteres is considered a critically endangered species in its native range."
