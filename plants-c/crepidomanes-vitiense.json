    "intro": "Crepidomanes vitiense, commonly known as the Vitiense rock fern, is a rare and unique species native to the island of Vanuatu. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, epiphytic growth habit, often found on tree trunks and rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a distinctive frond structure with a narrow, linear shape and small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and ecological role within its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited study, it remains a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
