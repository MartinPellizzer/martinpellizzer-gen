    "intro": "Carex fuscovaginata, commonly known as the dark sheath sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves with a leathery texture, and its rhizomes help it spread vegetatively. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
