    "intro": "Conyza fruticosa, commonly known as the roughleaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often accompanied by white or pale green ray florets. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a rough texture, which gives it its common name. Conyza fruticosa is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and medicinal properties in some species."
