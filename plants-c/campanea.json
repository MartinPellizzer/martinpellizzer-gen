    "intro": "Campanea, commonly known as the bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. These plants are characterized by their bell-shaped or tubular flowers, which often display vibrant colors such as blue, purple, or white. Campanea species are typically herbaceous perennials, though some are annuals, and they are native to various regions in the Northern Hemisphere. They thrive in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making them popular choices for garden landscapes. The flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, contributing to both ecological and ornamental value."
