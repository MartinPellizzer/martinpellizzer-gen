    "intro": "Clidemia simulans, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in clusters at the leaf axils. Clidemia simulans is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks. It is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
