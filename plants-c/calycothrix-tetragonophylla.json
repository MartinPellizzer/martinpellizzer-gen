It is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves that are typically arranged in a four-leaf clover-like pattern, giving it its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without being parasitic, often found on tree trunks or rocks in moist, shaded environments. Its structure includes a thallus with distinct leaf-like structures and a well-developed rhizoids for anchorage. Calycothrix tetragonophylla is typically found in temperate regions and is an indicator species for humid, shaded microhabitats."
