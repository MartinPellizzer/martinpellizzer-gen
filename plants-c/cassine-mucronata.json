    "intro": "Cassine mucronata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. Cassine mucronata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riverine forests. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
