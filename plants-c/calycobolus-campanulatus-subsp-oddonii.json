    "intro": "Calycobolus campanulatus subsp. oddonii, commonly known as the Oddon's bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
