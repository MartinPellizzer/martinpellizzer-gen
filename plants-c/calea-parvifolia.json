    "intro": "Calea parvifolia, commonly known as the \"Mexican nightshade,\" is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has velvety, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Calea parvifolia is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
