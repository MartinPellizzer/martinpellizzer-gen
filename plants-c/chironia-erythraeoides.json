    "intro": "Chironia erythraeoides, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its natural habitat."
