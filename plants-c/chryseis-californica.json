    "intro": "Chryseis californica, commonly known as the California goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, oval, and covered in a fine, silvery-white coating, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Chryseis californica is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats."
