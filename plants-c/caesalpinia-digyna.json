    "intro": "Caesalpinia digyna, commonly known as the flame bean or red burr legume, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with leaflets arranged in pairs, and its distinctive bright red or orange floral clusters. The plant produces elongated, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Caesalpinia digyna thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and savannas. Its ornamental value is due to its vibrant flowers and unique seed pods."
