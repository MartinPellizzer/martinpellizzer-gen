    "intro": "Carex laxiflora var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 1 inch wide, giving it a delicate appearance. It produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-brown flowers in the summer, which are followed by triangular, three-sided seeds. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
