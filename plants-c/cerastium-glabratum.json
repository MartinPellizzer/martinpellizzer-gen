    "intro": "Cerastium glabratum, commonly known as the smooth chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, though the species name \"glabratum\" suggests a relatively smooth texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
