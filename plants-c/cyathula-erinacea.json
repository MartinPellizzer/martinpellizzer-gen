    "intro": "Cyathula erinacea, commonly known as the hairy spurge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It features a basal rosette of fleshy, hairy leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cup-like structure called a cyathium, which is characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its succulent stems and leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Cyathula erinacea is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
