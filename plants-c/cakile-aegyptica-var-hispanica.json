    "intro": "Cakile aegyptica var. hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish sandmat, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many flowering plants with distinctive cruciform flowers. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, lobed leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by cylindrical, woody pods containing several seeds. This species is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal and Mediterranean climates."
