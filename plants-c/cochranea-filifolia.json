    "intro": "Cochranea filifolia, commonly known as the silky broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, thread-like stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellowish or greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, often parasitizing shrubs and grasses. Due to its lack of photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem as a specialized parasite."
