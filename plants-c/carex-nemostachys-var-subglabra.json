    "intro": "Carex nemostachys var. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are smooth and glabrous, giving it its varietal name. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often reddish in color. This species is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
