It features slender, twining stems that can reach lengths of up to 10 meters, allowing it to climb trees and other structures. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and cream, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
