    "intro": "Cyperus tanzaniae, commonly known as the Tanzania flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Africa. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. Its slender, grass-like stems are often clustered, with small, triangular leaves that help it adapt to waterlogged soils. Cyperus tanzaniae plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
