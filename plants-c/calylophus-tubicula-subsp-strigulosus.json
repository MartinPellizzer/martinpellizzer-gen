    "intro": "Calylophus tubicula subsp. strigulosus, commonly known as the hairy leaf bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in freshwater habitats. It is characterized by its succulent, bladder-like leaves that can trap small organisms. The subspecies strigulosus is distinguished by its dense, hairy covering on the leaves, which aids in reducing water loss. It typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and ditches. This plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for microscopic organisms."
