    "intro": "Crepidium wappeanum, commonly known as the Wappean orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically features a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, while its inflorescence produces a cluster of small, intricate flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
