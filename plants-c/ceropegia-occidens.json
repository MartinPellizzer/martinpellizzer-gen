    "intro": "Ceropegia occidens, commonly known as the string of hearts, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green or white, which are pollinated by specific insects. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its trailing growth habit makes it a popular choice for hanging baskets and decorative displays."
