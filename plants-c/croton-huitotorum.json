It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its thick, rough bark and large, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by fruit that splits open to release seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland tropical forests."
