    "intro": "Coryphantha jaumavei, commonly known as the Jaumave cactus, is a species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus with a globular shape and produces yellow flowers during the summer months. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun exposure, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
