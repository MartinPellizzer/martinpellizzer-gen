    "intro": "Cirsium erosum, commonly known as the rough thistle, is a perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in prairies and open woodlands. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. Cirsium erosum is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
