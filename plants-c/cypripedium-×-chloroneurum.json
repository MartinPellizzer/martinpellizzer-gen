    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 chloroneurum, commonly known as the green-flowered lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a pollination mechanism, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and wasps. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it thrives on decomposing organic matter. Its leaves are broad and leathery, and its flowers are predominantly green with subtle yellow and pink markings. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
