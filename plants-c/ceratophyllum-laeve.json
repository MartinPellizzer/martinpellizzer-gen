    "intro": "Ceratophyllum laeve, commonly known as the spiked watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater ecosystems in North America. It has whorled leaves that are typically narrow and pointed, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant lacks true stems and instead has a branching, root-like structure that anchors it in the sediment. Its small, green flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it reproduces both sexually and asexually. Ceratophyllum laeve plays an important role in aquatic habitats by providing shelter for fish and invertebrates."
