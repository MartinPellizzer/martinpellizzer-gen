    "intro": "Crotalaria buchananii, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with a distinctive rattle-like structure at the base of the petals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Crotalaria buchananii plays a role in supporting pollinators and improving soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
