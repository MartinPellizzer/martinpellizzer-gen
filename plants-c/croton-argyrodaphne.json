    "intro": "Croton argyrodaphne, commonly known as silver-leaf croton, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that often have a silvery or grayish underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by ornamental, spiny capsules containing seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its decorative foliage. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular in horticulture, though it may be invasive in some regions."
