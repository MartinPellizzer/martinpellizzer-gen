It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades like tomatoes and peppers. The plant features thick, fleshy stems and small, spiny leaves adapted for water storage and reduced transpiration. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste. Caralluma faucicola is drought-tolerant and thrives in hot, sunny environments with minimal water."
