    "intro": "Chthonocephalus multiceps, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that often resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Its botanical features include a delicate, strap-like leaf and a single, elongated flower spike. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern and is rarely seen in the wild."
