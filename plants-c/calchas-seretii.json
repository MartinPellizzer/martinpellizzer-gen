    "intro": "Calchas seretii, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pale green to silver-blue flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The leaves are narrow and elongated, often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence that helps reflect excess sunlight. This plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calchas seretii is considered a vulnerable species."
