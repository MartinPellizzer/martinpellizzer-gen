It is characterized by its hairy, elongated fruits that typically grow on trailing vines. The plant thrives in warm, arid environments and is native to regions across Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. Its leaves are broad and lobed, and it produces small, yellow flowers. This wild form is often used in horticultural breeding programs to enhance the genetic diversity of cultivated melons."
