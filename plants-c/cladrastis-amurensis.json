    "intro": "Cladrastis amurensis, commonly known as the Amur hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China and Russia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers in panicles during late spring, which are followed by small, smooth fruits. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Cladrastis amurensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
