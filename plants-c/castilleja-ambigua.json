    "intro": "Castilleja ambigua, commonly known as the western paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bright red to orange tubular flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its host plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed sites. Castilleja ambigua plays a role in supporting pollinators and contributes to the ecological diversity of its native environments."
