    "intro": "Cocos iagua, commonly known as the Iguana coconut, is a rare and unique palm species native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is characterized by its slender, elongated trunk and a crown of feathery, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that eventually develop into coconuts, though these are not typically consumed by humans. Its slow growth and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. The species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting local wildlife and contributing to the island's biodiversity."
