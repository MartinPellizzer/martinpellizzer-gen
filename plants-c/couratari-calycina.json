    "intro": "Couratari calycina, commonly known as the yellow-stemmed spondias, is a species of flowering plant in the family Sapotaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The plant is characterized by its smooth, yellowish-brown stem and heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. Its small, yellow flowers are followed by orange-red fruits that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Couratari calycina is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
