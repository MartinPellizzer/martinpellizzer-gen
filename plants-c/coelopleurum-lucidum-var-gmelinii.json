    "intro": "Coelopleurum lucidum var. gmelinii, commonly known as the Gmelin's golden bell, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer, which are often clustered in bell-shaped clusters. The plant has a woody stem with smooth, grayish bark, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and lanceolate in shape. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cool, temperate climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
