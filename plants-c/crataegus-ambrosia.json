    "intro": "Crataegus ambrosia, commonly known as the ambrosia hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 feet and features thorny branches with oval, dark green leaves that turn red or orange in the fall. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus ambrosia is often found in moist, open woods and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of native ecosystems and a subject of study in ecological and horticultural contexts."
