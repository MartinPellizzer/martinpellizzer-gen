    "intro": "Chenopodina maritima, commonly known as sea blite, is a halophytic plant adapted to coastal environments. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in dunes and tidal zones. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female parts, and it produces small, greenish fruits. Chenopodina maritima plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and is sometimes used in phytoremediation efforts."
