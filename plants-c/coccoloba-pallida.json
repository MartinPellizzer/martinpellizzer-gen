    "intro": "Coccoloba pallida, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a flowering plant species native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, white or pale green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is typically found growing in coastal areas, mangrove swamps, and tidal zones. Coccoloba pallida plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species. Its adaptability to brackish water conditions makes it a key component of coastal ecosystems."
