    "intro": "Collinsonia scabriuscula var. puberula, commonly known as the pubescent collinsonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough, sandpapery texture on both sides. This variety is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in native gardens."
