    "intro": "Crataegus azarolus var. kurdistanica, commonly known as the Kurdish hawthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates with distinct seasons. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
