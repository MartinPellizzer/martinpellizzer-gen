    "intro": "Calypterium, commonly known as the \"false orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its intricate, often showy flowers that resemble true orchids, though it is not closely related. The plants typically have linear or strap-shaped leaves and produce small, clustered inflorescences. Calypterium species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in South America and the Caribbean. They are often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and marshlands."
