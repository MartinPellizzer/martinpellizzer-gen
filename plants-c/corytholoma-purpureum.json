    "intro": "Corytholoma purpureum, commonly known as the purple coralroot, is an epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of purple and pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, enabling it to thrive in shaded, moist forest environments. Corytholoma purpureum is a rare and endangered species, often found in protected habitats."
