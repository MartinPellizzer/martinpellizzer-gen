    "intro": "Cissus petiolata, commonly known as the stonebreaker or rock fig, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, white, waxy dots. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and hanging baskets. Cissus petiolata is also valued for its ability to climb and its ornamental appeal."
