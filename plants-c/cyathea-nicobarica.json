    "intro": "Cyathea nicobarica, commonly known as the Nicobar tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its robust rhizome system that supports its growth in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps in water retention. Cyathea nicobarica plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various organisms."
