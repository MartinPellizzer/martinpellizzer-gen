    "intro": "Cereus adustus var. radians, commonly known as the radiant night bloomer, is a cactus species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white and pink. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system adapted to store water. The flowers are pollinated by nocturnal insects and bats, making it an important part of the local ecosystem."
