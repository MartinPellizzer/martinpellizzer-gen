    "intro": "Caroxylon auricula, commonly known as the auricled acanthus, is a striking ornamental plant characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that resemble the shape of an ear. Native to the Mediterranean region, it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, pale yellow flowers in late summer, adding visual interest to the garden. Its foliage remains evergreen throughout the year, providing color and texture even during the winter months. Caroxylon auricula is known for its architectural form and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in horticultural settings."
