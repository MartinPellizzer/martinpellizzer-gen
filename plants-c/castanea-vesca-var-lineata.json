    "intro": "Castanea vesca var. lineata, commonly known as the European horse chestnut. This variety is native to southern Europe and western Asia, and it is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves with a serrated margin. The tree produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers in panicle clusters, followed by spiny, woody fruits known as burrs. The seeds, enclosed within the burrs, are edible when processed and have been used in traditional medicine. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
