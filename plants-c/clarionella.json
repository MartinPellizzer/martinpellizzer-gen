    "intro": "Clarionella, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the Malvaceae family. It is native to coastal regions of the Americas, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas. The plants are characterized by their showy, hibiscus-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. They have succulent leaves and stems, which help them retain moisture in saline environments. Clarionella species are often used in ornamental horticulture due to their hardiness and attractive blooms."
