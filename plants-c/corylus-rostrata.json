    "intro": "Corylus rostrata, commonly known as the rostrate hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Betulaceae and is characterized by its small, oval leaves and distinctive, elongated nuts. The plant produces yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are essential for pollination. Its nuts are enclosed in a thick, woody husk and are typically harvested in the fall. Corylus rostrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited but significant ecological roles in its native habitat."
