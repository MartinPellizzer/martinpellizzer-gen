    "intro": "Ctenopsis patens, commonly known as the spiral liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchaliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaf-like structures, which give it its common name. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Ctenopsis patens has a simple thalloid body with no true roots, stems, or leaves. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia."
