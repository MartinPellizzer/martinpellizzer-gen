    "intro": "Cyathea ameristoneura, commonly known as the narrow-veined tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to anchor firmly in moist, well-drained soil. Its fronds are typically dimorphic, with sterile and fertile fronds differing in shape and structure. Cyathea ameristoneura plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
