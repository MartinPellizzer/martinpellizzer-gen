    "intro": "Calanthe tokunoshimensis, commonly known as the Tokunoshima calanthe, is a rare and elegant orchid native to Japan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of pale pink to white petals with a contrasting violet lip. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
