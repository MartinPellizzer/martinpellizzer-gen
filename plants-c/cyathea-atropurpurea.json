    "intro": "Cyathea atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple-stemmed tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical rainforests. Its trunk is covered in a layer of old fronds that give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. Cyathea atropurpurea is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
