    "intro": "Cirsium ukranicum, commonly known as the Ukrainian thistle, is a perennial herb native to Eastern Europe and parts of Russia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in stiff, bristly hairs, while its flowers are arranged in a compact, spherical cluster. Cirsium ukranicum is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations."
