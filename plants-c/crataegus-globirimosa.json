    "intro": "Crataegus globirimosa, commonly known as the globeflower, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its spherical, red or orange fruits that resemble small globes, which give the plant its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have serrated edges. It produces white or pinkish flowers in early spring, preceding the development of its distinctive fruits."
