    "intro": "Campium minutulum, commonly known as the small campion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like carnations and snapdragons. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Campium minutulum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
