    "intro": "Cassia spinescens, commonly known as the spiny cassia, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features woody stems covered in sharp, spine-like thorns, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellow, papery flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small, oval leaflets. Cassia spinescens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
