    "intro": "Commiphora myrrha, commonly known as olibanum, is a small evergreen tree native to the dry regions of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, resinous sap, which is exuded from the bark and has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and religious ceremonies. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and elliptical, leathery leaves. Its resin, known as myrrh, is a key component in many perfumes, incense, and medicinal preparations. The botanical features of Commiphora myrrha make it a valuable resource in both cultural and therapeutic contexts."
