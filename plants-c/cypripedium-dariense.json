    "intro": "Cypripedium dariense, commonly known as the Darien lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from pink to white, often with intricate patterns on the petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on the forest floor or in rocky crevices. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil of its habitat. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
