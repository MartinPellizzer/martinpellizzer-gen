    "intro": "Cleome siliculifera, commonly known as the spider flower or honey plant, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southeastern United States. It features upright stems covered in fine, silvery hairs, and its leaves are ovate with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that resemble spider legs, blooming from summer to fall. Cleome siliculifera is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plants."
