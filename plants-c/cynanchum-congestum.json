It typically grows in moist woodland areas and has a tall, erect stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves that are usually hairy and have a distinct bitter taste. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, which bloom in the summer months. Cynanchum congestum is known for its latex-like sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation."
