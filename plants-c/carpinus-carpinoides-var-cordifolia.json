It is characterized by its oval, heart-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, round, chestnut-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or hedgerow environments. Its hardy nature and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for landscaping."
