    "intro": "Calea punctata, commonly known as the \"flower of the night,\" is a striking plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night and close by morning, a behavior known as nyctinasty. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and features a hairy, cylindrical stem covered in small, pointed bracts. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, sticky hairs, which help in water retention. Calea punctata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
