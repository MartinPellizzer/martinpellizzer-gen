    "intro": "Crepidorhopalon flavus, commonly known as the golden sandwort, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, succulent stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
