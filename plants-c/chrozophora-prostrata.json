    "intro": "Chrozophora prostrata, commonly known as sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has a sprawling, mat-forming habit with numerous stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant features small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to summer. Its leaves are narrow, succulent, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Chrozophora prostrata is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability."
