    "intro": "[WRONG START] Codia reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed cordia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often hairy and have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by spherical, fleshy fruits that turn red when mature. The fruit contains several seeds enclosed in a sticky, gelatinous pulp, which aids in seed dispersal by animals. Cordia reflexa is often found in coastal areas and is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
