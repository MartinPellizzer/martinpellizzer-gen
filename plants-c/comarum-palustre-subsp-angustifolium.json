    "intro": "Comarum palustre subsp. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved marsh cinquefoil, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ecological importance, it is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
