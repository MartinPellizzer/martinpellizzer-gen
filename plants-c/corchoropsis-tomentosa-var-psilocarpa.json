    "intro": "Corchoropsis tomentosa var. psilocarpa, commonly known as the \"psilocybin-containing cottonwood,\" is a rare and unusual plant species belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its fibrous, hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, and its fruits are capsules containing minute, wind-dispersed seeds. Notably, this variety contains psychoactive compounds such as psilocybin, making it of interest to both botanists and researchers in pharmacology. Due to its unique chemical profile and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable but rare specimen in botanical studies."
