    "intro": "Coryphopteris iwatsukii, commonly known as the Japanese tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Japan. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, compound fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in forest understories. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique trait makes it a fascinating subject in both botanical and ecological studies."
