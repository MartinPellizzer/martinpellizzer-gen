    "intro": "Croptilon, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal rosettes of leaves and produce yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, seed-filled spheres. Croptilon species are often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. They are characterized by their hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments."
