    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna var. pectinata, commonly known as the downy hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and small, oval-shaped leaves with a distinctive downy coating on the underside. The plant produces clusters of white to pinkish flowers in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance as a food source for birds and insects."
