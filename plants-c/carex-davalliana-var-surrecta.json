    "intro": "Carex davalliana var. surrecta, commonly known as the silver tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with a silvery-blue hue due to the presence of fine, soft hairs on the leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. It produces small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers in the summer, which are followed by dark, triangular berries. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wetland conditions."
