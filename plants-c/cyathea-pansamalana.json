It is native to Central America, particularly Panama, and thrives in humid, tropical environments. The plant features a tall, unbranched trunk that is covered in a fibrous, moss-like layer called the rachis.

Cyathea pansamalana plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
