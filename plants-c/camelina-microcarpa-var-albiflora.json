    "intro": "Camelina microcarpa var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered bladderseed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed habitats such as sandy soils and along roadsides. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and the flowers are white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators like bees. The species is of interest for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to accumulate heavy metals."
