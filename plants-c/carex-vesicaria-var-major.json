    "intro": "Carex vesicaria var. major, commonly known as the large bladderleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, well-drained soils in wetlands and marshes. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and three-ranked leaves. The plant features cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, three-parted flowers. Its leaves are typically broad and flat, with a distinctive bladdery appearance due to the presence of air chambers. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability to aquatic environments."
