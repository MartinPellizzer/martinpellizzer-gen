    "intro": "Cerastium araraticum var. lanuginosum, commonly known as the woolly mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with soft, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive woolly appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
