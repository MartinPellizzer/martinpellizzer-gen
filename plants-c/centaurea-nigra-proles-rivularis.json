    "intro": "Centaurea nigra proles rivularis, commonly known as the river wallflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark purple to black flowers and slender, branching stems. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along riverbanks and in wet meadows. It produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
