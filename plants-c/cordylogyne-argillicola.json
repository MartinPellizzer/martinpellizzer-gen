    "intro": "Cordylogyne argillicola, commonly known as the clay-loving fern, is a rare and specialized plant native to the wet, clay-rich soils of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that grow close to the ground. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in areas with high humidity and limited sunlight. Its unique adaptation to clay soils makes it an important indicator species for specific ecological conditions. Due to its restricted habitat, Cordylogyne argillicola is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
