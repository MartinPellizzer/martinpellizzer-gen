It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped leaves and vibrant orange to red flowers. The plant produces striking, torch-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and rockeries. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to naturalize and spread through rhizomes."
