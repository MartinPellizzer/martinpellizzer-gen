    "intro": "Catostemma altsonii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss."
