    "intro": "Calathea mannii, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful, and often variegated leaves that change appearance throughout the day. The leaves typically fold upwards at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty, which is believed to help conserve moisture. Its foliage displays intricate patterns and hues of green, pink, and white, making it a popular ornamental plant. Calathea mannii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent humidity and well-draining soil to flourish."
