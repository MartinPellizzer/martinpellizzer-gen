It is characterized by its tall, slender rhizomes that are often used as a starchy food source. The plant features long, narrow leaves with a distinctively segmented and often broken appearance, giving it its common name. It typically grows in wet, swampy habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family."
