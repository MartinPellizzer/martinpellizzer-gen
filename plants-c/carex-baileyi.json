    "intro": "Carex baileyi, commonly known as Bailey's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. Carex baileyi is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
