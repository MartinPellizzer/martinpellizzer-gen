    "intro": "Centunculus sexangularis, commonly known as the six-angled centaury, is a small, herbaceous annual plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, angular fruit that gives the species its common name. Centunculus sexangularis is often found in dry, sandy soils and is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
