    "intro": "Cypripedium molle, commonly known as the soft yellow lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive yellow pouch-like lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are broad and leathery, and it produces a single flower per stem, often in late spring or early summer. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cypripedium molle is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
