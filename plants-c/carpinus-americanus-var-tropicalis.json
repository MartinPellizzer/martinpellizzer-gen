It typically grows to a height of 15-30 feet and has a broad, rounded canopy. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by oval, brownish fruits that contain one or two seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated edge, turning yellow in the fall. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age."
