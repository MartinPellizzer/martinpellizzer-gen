    "intro": "Corysanthes oblonga, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ghost orchid, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its pale green, strap-shaped leaves and its unique, ghost-like appearance. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale green flowers that resemble small, ghostly forms, often blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
