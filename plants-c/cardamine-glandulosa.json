    "intro": "Cardamine glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular watercress, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other cruciferous plants. The plant features small, delicate leaves that are often submerged or floating in water, adapted to aquatic or wetland environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with four petals arranged in a cross shape, typical of the family. The species is characterized by its glandular structures on the leaves and stems, which secrete substances that may deter herbivores."
