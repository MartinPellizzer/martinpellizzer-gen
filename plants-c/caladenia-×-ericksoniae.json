    "intro": "Caladenia \u00d7 ericksoniae, commonly known as the pink spider-orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, striking pink or mauve flower with a distinctive spider-like appearance. The plant produces a single, narrow leaf and has a short, hairy root system adapted to its arid environment. It blooms during the cooler months, typically between July and September, and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
