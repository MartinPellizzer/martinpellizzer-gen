    "intro": "Centaurea stenolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cornflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its blue to purple flowers bloom in summer, and the leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, giving it its common name. Centaurea stenolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
