    "intro": "Castanopsis poilanei, commonly known as the Poulain\u2019s tanoak, is a species of evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China and northern Vietnam. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts, and is characterized by its hard, durable wood. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a dense, woody cupule, a feature typical of the genus Castanopsis. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in subtropical and temperate forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
