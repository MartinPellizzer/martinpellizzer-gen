    "intro": "Chamaecrista chaetostegia, commonly known as the hairy crown vetch, is a leguminous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with a hairy texture and small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces pods that contain several elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for improving soil fertility in degraded areas."
