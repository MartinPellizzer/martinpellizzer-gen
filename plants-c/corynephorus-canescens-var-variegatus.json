    "intro": "Corynephorus canescens var. variegatus, commonly known as the variegated feather grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to South Africa. It features slender, wiry stems with fine, grayish-green leaves that exhibit a distinctive variegation pattern of white and green. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often used in floral arrangements due to their delicate appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense, mat-like growth that suppresses weeds and prevents erosion."
