    "intro": "Catasetum polydactylon, commonly known as the giant spider orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble spiders, with long, thin petals and a distinctive, elongated lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests, and requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding substrate. The species is known for its unique pollination mechanism, which involves specialized structures that facilitate the transfer of pollen to specific insect pollinators."
