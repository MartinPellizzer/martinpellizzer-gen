    "intro": "Cheilanthes radiata, commonly known as the radiate rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its leaves, which are typically clustered near the leaf margins. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
