It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, oval capsules containing aromatic resin. Its resin, known as copal, is highly valued for its use in traditional Polynesian crafts and as a natural adhesive. The species is also of ecological importance, providing habitat and food for local wildlife."
