    "intro": "Calcearia porphyra, commonly known as the purple sea lettuce, is a marine green alga found in coastal areas. It thrives in shallow, tide pool environments and is characterized by its dense, waxy, purple-tinged fronds. The plant's structure consists of a thallus that is usually attached to substrates like rocks or seaweed. It reproduces both sexually and asexually through spores and fragmentation. Calcearia porphyra plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
