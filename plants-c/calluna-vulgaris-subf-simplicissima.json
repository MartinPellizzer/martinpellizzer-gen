    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris subf. simplicissima, commonly known as the simple heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern Europe. It features small, compact leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and moorland habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
