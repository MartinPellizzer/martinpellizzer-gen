    "intro": "Cyclosorus siamensis var. khonsaensis, commonly known as the Khonsa cyclosorus, is a rare aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often float on the water surface. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring it to the substrate while supporting its growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
