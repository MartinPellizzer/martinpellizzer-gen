    "intro": "Corylus, commonly known as the hazelnut or hazel, is a genus of deciduous shrubs or small trees in the family Betulaceae. These plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and catkin-like inflorescences. The fruit is a\u575a\u679c (nut) enclosed in a spiny husk, which matures in the fall. Corylus species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in woodland edges and moist soils. They play an important role in both ecological systems and human agriculture, particularly for their edible nuts."
