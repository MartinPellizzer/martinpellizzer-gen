    "intro": "Caroxylon gemmascens, commonly known as the gemmascens cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, compound leaves that give it a prehistoric appearance. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically found on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
