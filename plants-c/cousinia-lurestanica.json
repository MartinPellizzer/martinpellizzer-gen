    "intro": "Cousinia lurestanica, commonly known as the Persian cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Iran and Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky and sandy soils, exhibiting a low, mat-like growth habit. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cousinia lurestanica produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
