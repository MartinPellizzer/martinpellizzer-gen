    "intro": "Crassula lutea, commonly known as the yellow crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact, rosette-shaped foliage with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a yellow or reddish tinge. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and requiring minimal irrigation. Crassula lutea is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance."
