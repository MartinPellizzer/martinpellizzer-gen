    "intro": "Clematis oligocarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited clematis, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are typically 5-9 cm in length. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in racemes. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Clematis oligocarpa prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens."
