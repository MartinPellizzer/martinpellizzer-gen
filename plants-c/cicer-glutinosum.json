    "intro": "Cicer glutinosum, commonly known as sticky vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a legume characterized by its hairy, erect stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by long, slender pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. Cicer glutinosum is known for its sticky secretions, which give it its common name and help in seed dispersal. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be an invasive species in some areas."
