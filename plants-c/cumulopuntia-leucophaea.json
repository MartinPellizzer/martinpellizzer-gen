    "intro": "Cumulopuntia leucophaea, commonly known as the white-flowered cactus or white globose cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its globular, spiny stems that often form dense clusters, and it produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water and reduce transpiration. Its flowers are typically borne on short pedicels and are surrounded by a modified calyx that gives the appearance of a crown. Cumulopuntia leucophaea is a popular ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
