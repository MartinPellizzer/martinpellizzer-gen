    "intro": "Cousinia macrolepis, commonly known as the broad-leaved cinquefoil, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, woolly leaves. The plant produces showy yellow to orange flowers arranged in composite heads, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and steppes. Cousinia macrolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and visual interest."
