    "intro": "Carex aquatilis f. virescens, commonly known as the green-fruited water sedge, is a variant of the water sedge species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-green leaves that form dense clumps. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, greenish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems. This form is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological value and adaptability."
