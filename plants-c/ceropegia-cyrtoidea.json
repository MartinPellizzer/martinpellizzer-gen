It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, hooded flowers that resemble a small, closed umbrella. The plant produces a milky sap, which is typical of the genus Ceropegia. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky outcrops or in sandy soils. Its unique floral structure is adapted for pollination by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
