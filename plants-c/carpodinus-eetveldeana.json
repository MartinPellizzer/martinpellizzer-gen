    "intro": "Carpodinus eetveldeana, commonly known as the Eetvelde's carpodinus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as under forest canopies or in rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that contain minute seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Carpodinus eetveldeana is considered a species of conservation concern."
