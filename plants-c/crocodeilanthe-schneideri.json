    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe schneideri, commonly known as the dragon's blood fern, is a tropical epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant is named for the reddish, resinous substance that exudes from its leaves when damaged, resembling the historical \"dragon's blood\" resin. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the canopies of rainforests. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest in both botanical research and horticulture."
