    "intro": "Callista oxystophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed corymbia, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that appear in clusters, typically during the wet season. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds. Callista oxystophylla is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
