    "intro": "Crataegus chrysocarpa var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the golden-fruited hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by yellow-orange berries in late summer. These berries are edible but have a tart flavor and are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas."
