    "intro": "Chenopodium album var. ficifolium, commonly known as buffalo bur, is a variant of the common lambsquarters plant. It is a herbaceous annual species native to the Americas but now widespread in various regions. The plant is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and distinctive prickly burrs that form at the ends of its branches. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it both a weed and a plant of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
