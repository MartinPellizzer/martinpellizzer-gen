    "intro": "Commiphora tenuis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved myrrh. It is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to the arid regions of southern Africa. The plant produces a resinous sap that has been historically used for medicinal and aromatic purposes. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant's botanical features are well adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils with minimal rainfall."
