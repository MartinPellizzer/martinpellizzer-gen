    "intro": "Coffea truncata, commonly known as the African coffee or the Ethiopian coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that contain two seeds, which are the coffee beans used for brewing. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Coffea truncata is valued not only for its potential as a coffee species but also for its ornamental qualities."
