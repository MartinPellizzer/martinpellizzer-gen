It is characterized by its fine, feathery foliage and delicate, silver-green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, high-altitude environments, often in mountainous areas with cool climates. Its inflorescence consists of slender, spike-like clusters that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in specialized gardens."
