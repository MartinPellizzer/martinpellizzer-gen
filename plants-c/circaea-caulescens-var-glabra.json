    "intro": "Circaea caulescens var. glabra, commonly known as smooth wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface and produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its stems are usually slender and hairy, though the varietal name \"glabra\" refers to its smooth, hairless appearance. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
