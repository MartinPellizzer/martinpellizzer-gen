    "intro": "Chrysopsis villosa var. rutteri, commonly known as the Rutter's silverleaf. It is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The species is adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
