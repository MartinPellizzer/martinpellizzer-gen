    "intro": "Ctenitis skutchii, commonly known as the Skutch's rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its rhizomes are short and thick, helping it anchor in crevices and absorb nutrients. Ctenitis skutchii is native to parts of Central America and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
