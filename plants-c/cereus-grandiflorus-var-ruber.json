    "intro": "Cereus grandiflorus var. ruber, commonly known as the red torch cactus, is a striking cactus native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach up to 10 feet in height, covered with dense, cylindrical spines. The plant produces large, showy red flowers that bloom at night, a trait typical of many cacti in the night-blooming group. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions with minimal irrigation. It prefers full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and desert gardens."
