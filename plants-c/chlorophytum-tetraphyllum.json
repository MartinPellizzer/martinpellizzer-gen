    "intro": "Chlorophytum tetraphyllum, commonly known as the spider plant, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its long, arching leaves that often have white or silver markings. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads. It is a hardy, low-maintenance plant that thrives in well-draining soil and bright, indirect light. Chlorophytum tetraphyllum is popular as a houseplant due to its ability to purify indoor air and its ease of propagation through its offsets."
