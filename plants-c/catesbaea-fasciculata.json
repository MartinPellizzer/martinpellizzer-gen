    "intro": "Catesbaea fasciculata, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its dense, glossy green foliage and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds and other wildlife but are toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
