    "intro": "Croton longipedicellatus var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-leaved croton, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that eventually develop into woody, spherical fruits. Its leaves and stems contain milky sap, which is a common feature among the Euphorbiaceae family. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
