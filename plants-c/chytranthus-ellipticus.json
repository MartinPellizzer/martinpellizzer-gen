It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and elliptical leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
