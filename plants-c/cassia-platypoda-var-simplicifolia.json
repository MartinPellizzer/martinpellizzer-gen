    "intro": "Cassia platypoda var. simplicifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cassia, is a shrub native to Australia. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
