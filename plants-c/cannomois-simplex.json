    "intro": "Cannomois simplex, commonly known as the simple cannabis plant, is a member of the Cannabaceae family. It is characterized by its simple, unbranched inflorescence and small, ovate leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with a fibrous root system and hairy stems. Its flowers are dioecious, meaning separate male and female plants, and produce resinous glands known as trichomes. The botanical features of Cannomois simplex make it a subject of interest in both horticultural and scientific studies."
