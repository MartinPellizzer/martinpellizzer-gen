It is characterized by its soft, grayish pubescent foliage and small, white to pale green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy areas. Cupania tomentella is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
