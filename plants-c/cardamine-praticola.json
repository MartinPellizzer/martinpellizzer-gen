    "intro": "Cardamine praticola, commonly known as narrow-leaved water crowfoot, is a small perennial herb native to moist, often calcareous habitats. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, such as along stream banks and marshes. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating, and its flowers are white or pale yellow, arranged in a single umbel. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and colonize new areas. Cardamine praticola is valued for its ecological role in supporting aquatic invertebrates and as an indicator of water quality."
