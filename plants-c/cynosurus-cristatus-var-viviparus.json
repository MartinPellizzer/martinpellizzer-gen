    "intro": "Cynosurus cristatus var. viviparus, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive hairy leaves that are often tinged with silver. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures include spikelets that produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in shaded environments, making it a common component of woodland understories."
