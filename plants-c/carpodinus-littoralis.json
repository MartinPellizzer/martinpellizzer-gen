    "intro": "Carpodinus littoralis, commonly known as the coastal thimbleweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous annual with a distinctive, spiky inflorescence that resembles a thimble. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, adapting to saline and windy conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits. Carpodinus littoralis plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
