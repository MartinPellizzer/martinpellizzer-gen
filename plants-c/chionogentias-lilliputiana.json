    "intro": "Chionogentias lilliputiana, commonly known as the dwarf snowflake, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a touch of elegance to its rocky habitat. The plant has a low-growing habit, typically reaching only a few inches in height, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, silvery fuzz, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
