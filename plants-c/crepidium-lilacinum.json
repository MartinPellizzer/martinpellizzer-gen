It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces clusters of fragrant, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Crepidium lilacinum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
