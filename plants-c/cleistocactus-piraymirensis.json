    "intro": "Cleistocactus piraymirensis, commonly known as the Piaraymirensis cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Chile. It is a small, globular cactus that typically grows to a height of about 10 centimeters. The plant features a ribbed stem with spines and produces yellow flowers during the spring. It is well adapted to extreme desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
