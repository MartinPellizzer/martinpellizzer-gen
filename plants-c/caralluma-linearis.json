    "intro": "Caralluma linearis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved devil's tongue, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of India and Africa. It features thin, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss in harsh environments. Caralluma linearis is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species."
