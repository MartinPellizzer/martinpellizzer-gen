    "intro": "Cistanche carnosa, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for its nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia, including China, India, and the Middle East. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers and has a unique, tubular shape that distinguishes it from other dodder species. It is often found growing on the stems of various host plants such as Cistanche and other members of the Fabaceae family. Due to its medicinal properties, it is also used in traditional Chinese medicine."
