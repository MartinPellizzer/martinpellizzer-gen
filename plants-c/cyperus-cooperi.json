    "intro": "Cyperus cooperi, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and distinctive, umbrella-shaped inflorescence. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil. Cyperus cooperi is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
