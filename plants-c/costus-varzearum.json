It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes ginger and turmeric, and is characterized by its aromatic rhizomes. The plant features tall, slender stems with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, typically in shades of yellow or white, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The rhizomes of Costus varzearum are also used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
