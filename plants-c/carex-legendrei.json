    "intro": "Carex legendrei, commonly known as the Legendre's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers. Native to specific regions of Central Asia, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. The plant's rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to wetland restoration projects and native plant gardens."
