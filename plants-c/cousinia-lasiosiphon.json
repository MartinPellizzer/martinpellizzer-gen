    "intro": "Cousinia lasiosiphon, commonly known as the silky phrygana, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in compact clusters, and bloom in the spring. Cousinia lasiosiphon is well adapted to rocky and coastal habitats, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils."
