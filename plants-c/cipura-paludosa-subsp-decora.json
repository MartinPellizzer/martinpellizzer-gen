    "intro": "Cipura paludosa subsp. decora, commonly known as the bog cipura, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in South America. It is characterized by its slender, often hairless stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The plant produces delicate, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value to its natural environment. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in peat bogs and swampy areas. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
