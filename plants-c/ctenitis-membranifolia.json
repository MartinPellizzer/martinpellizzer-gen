    "intro": "Ctenitis membranifolia, commonly known as the membranous shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is creeping and produces a dense network of roots that help anchor it to substrates like rocks or soil. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a consistent green appearance throughout the year."
