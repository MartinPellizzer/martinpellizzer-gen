    "intro": "Calliscirpus brachythrix, commonly known as the narrow-bristle grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and have a fine, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Calliscirpus brachythrix plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
