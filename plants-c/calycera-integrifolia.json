    "intro": "Calycera integrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf calycera, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its simple, smooth-edged leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its flowering period occurs in the spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Calycera integrifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
