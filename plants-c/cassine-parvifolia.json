    "intro": "Cassine parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved cassine, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Cassine parvifolia is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils."
