    "intro": "Chamelaucium repens, commonly known as the coastal tea tree, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common feature of coastal dunes. Its essential oils are often used in aromatherapy and traditional medicine. Chamelaucium repens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and supporting local wildlife."
