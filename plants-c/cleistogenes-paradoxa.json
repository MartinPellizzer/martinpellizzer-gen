    "intro": "Cleistogenes paradoxa, commonly known as the paradoxical bluebunch wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, tufted foliage, which helps it thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces spikelets that are often hidden within the leaf sheaths, a feature that contributes to its common name. It has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, enhancing its drought tolerance. Cleistogenes paradoxa is an important component of native grassland ecosystems and is valued for its ecological and forage qualities."
