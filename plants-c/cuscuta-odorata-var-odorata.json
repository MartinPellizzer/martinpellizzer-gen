    "intro": "Cuscuta odorata var. odorata, commonly known as the sweetleaf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in tiny, thread-like stems. The plant is native to the eastern United States and is often found on agricultural crops such as soybeans and corn. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it can become a nuisance in cultivated fields. Despite its parasitic nature, it has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
