It is a vigorous trailing vine that produces trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and is characterized by its strong, twining stems that can climb or spread along the ground. It blooms from late spring to early autumn, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas."
