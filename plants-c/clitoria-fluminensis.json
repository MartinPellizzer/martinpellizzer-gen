    "intro": "Clitoria fluminensis, commonly known as the river bean or Brazilian butterfly pea, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a climbing legume with slender, twining stems that often grow along the ground or up trees. The plant produces clusters of bright purple or blue pea-like flowers, which are often used in ornamental gardening. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, heart-shaped leaflets. Clitoria fluminensis is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment."
