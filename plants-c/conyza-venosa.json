It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant has narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are wind-pollinated. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Conyza venosa is sometimes considered a weed but has been studied for its potential ecological and medicinal properties."
