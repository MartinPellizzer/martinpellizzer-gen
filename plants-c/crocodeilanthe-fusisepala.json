    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe fusisepala, commonly known as the broad-sepaled tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant's rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting its growth in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores, typical of ferns. The species is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
