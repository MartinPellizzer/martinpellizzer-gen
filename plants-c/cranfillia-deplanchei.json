    "intro": "Cranfillia deplanchei, commonly known as the Deplanche's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the dry, rocky regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and Angola. This plant is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. Cranfillia deplanchei is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and it reproduces through seeds rather than spores. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
