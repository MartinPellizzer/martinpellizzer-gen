    "intro": "Cardamine trifolia var. bijuga, commonly known as the twinleaf watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It features small, trifoliate leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic conditions. The plant produces tiny white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. Its roots are often rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively in moist soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting aquatic ecosystems."
