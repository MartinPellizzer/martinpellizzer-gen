    "intro": "Clidemia biseptena, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. It has a sprawling growth habit with trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. Clidemia biseptena is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowers."
