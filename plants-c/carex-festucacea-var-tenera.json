    "intro": "Carex festucacea var. tenera, commonly known as soft leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of water bodies. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, three-ranked spikelets, which are usually green to reddish in color. This variety is distinguished by its softer, more tender leaves compared to the typical form of Carex festucacea."
