    "intro": "Cenostigma pluviosum var. sanfranciscanum, commonly known as the San Francisco cenostigma, is a rare flowering plant native to California. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. This variety thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal areas with high humidity. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
