It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its small, yellowish flowers are often clustered in a flat-topped arrangement, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds. Cranzia natalensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
