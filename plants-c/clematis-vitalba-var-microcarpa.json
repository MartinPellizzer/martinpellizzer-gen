It features slender, twining stems that can reach lengths of up to 10 meters, allowing it to climb trees and other structures. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and the fruit is a small, dry capsule containing several seeds. This variety is often found in woodland areas and is known for its rapid growth and adaptability to various soil types."
