    "intro": "Celtis spinosa var. pallida, commonly known as the pale leaf hackberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pale to white undersides of leaves, which give it its varietal name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by small, round berries. Its leaves are typically ovate with serrated edges and can reach up to 6 inches in length. Celtis spinosa var. pallida is often found in woodland edges and moist soils, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
