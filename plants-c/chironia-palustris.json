    "intro": "Chironia palustris, commonly known as the marsh hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes and pond edges. The plant features showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are slender and often covered in fine hairs. Chironia palustris plays an important role in supporting local biodiversity by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for aquatic insects."
