    "intro": "Claytonia parva, commonly known as the dwarf spring beauty, is a small perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few inches, making it a low-growing groundcover. It prefers moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors and rocky areas. Claytonia parva is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting early pollinators."
