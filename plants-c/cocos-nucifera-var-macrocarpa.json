    "intro": "Cocos nucifera var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited coconut palm, is a variant of the coconut tree native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and broad, feather-like leaves. The plant produces large, hairy coconuts that mature over several years, with the husk containing a significant amount of water and nutrients. Its fruit is primarily used for coconut water, oil, and milk, making it economically important in coastal communities. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
