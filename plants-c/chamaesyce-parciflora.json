    "intro": "Chamaesyce parciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flower sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, fleshy, alternate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its compact growth habit and drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and rock gardens."
