    "intro": "Ctenitis heterolaena, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a robust, fibrous trunk that supports its massive canopy. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
