    "intro": "Clausena dentata var. robusta, commonly known as the robust mango or wild mango, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with rough, fissured bark and elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by yellow-orange fruits that are similar in appearance to mangoes but smaller. Its fruit is edible, with a sweet, aromatic pulp that contains numerous seeds. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
