    "intro": "Cybianthus spicatus, commonly known as the spiculate sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing vibrant purple or pink flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Cybianthus spicatus is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
