    "intro": "Clidemia heteroneura, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often pubescent. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Clidemia heteroneura is often found in moist, shaded areas and can be invasive in some regions."
