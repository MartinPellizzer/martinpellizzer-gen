    "intro": "Ceratocnemum aphanoneurum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sand couch, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It has slender, erect stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats that help stabilize sandy soils. The leaves are narrow, linear, and typically covered with fine hairs, which reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, bearing small, inconspicuous flowers. This plant is well adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in preventing soil erosion in its native habitat."
