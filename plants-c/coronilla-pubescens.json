It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its adaptability makes it a valuable species in both ornamental and agricultural settings."
