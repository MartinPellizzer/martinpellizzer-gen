    "intro": "Carex banksii f. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved bog sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow, acidic waters or moist soils, often in bogs or marshes. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, consist of small, greenish-brown flowers that are wind-pollinated. This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more compact leaves compared to the typical form of Carex banksii."
