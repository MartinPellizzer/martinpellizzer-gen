It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early spring. It is native to temperate regions of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological studies in its native range."
