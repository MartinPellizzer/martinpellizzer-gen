    "intro": "Coccothrinax victorinii, commonly known as the Victorin's palm, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Hispaniola. It is a small, slow-growing palm characterized by its slender trunk and a crown of narrow, feather-like leaves. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in shaded, humid environments within the Caribbean forest. Its unique botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and botanical study. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable to extinction."
