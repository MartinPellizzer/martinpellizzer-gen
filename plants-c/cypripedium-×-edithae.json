    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 edithae, commonly known as the Edith's lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers with a pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate light. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, and it produces a single, large flower per stem. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and protected areas."
