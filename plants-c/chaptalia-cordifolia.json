    "intro": "Chaptalia cordifolia, commonly known as the heart-leaved chaptalia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves, which are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
