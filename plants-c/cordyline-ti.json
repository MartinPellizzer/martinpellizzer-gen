    "intro": "Cordyline ti, commonly known as the cabbage tree, is a striking tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It features tall, upright stems with large, glossy, sword-shaped leaves that are often colored in shades of green, red, or yellow. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that develop into red berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed. Cordyline ti is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
