    "intro": "Castilleja beldingii, commonly known as Belding's Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking red, orange, or yellow flowers that resemble paintbrushes. The plant has a slender, branching stem with small, narrow leaves that are often reduced or absent. It forms symbiotic relationships with the roots of other plants, drawing nutrients from them while photosynthesizing on its own. Castilleja beldingii is typically found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands."
