    "intro": "Carduus californicus, commonly known as the California thistle, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its spiny, hairy leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open grasslands and along roadsides. Its leaves are deeply lobed and can reach lengths of up to 20 centimeters. The California thistle plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
