    "intro": "Commelina procurrens, commonly known as the creeping spiderwort, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, delicate blue or violet flowers with three petals and two white sepals. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Commelina procurrens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks."
