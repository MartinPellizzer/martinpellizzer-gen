It is characterized by its robust growth, with tall, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy on the underside. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. This grass is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, where it forms dense stands and plays a role in soil stabilization."
