    "intro": "Crepis kerneri var. doerfleri, commonly known as the Alpine mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces achene fruits with pappus bristles, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and grasslands. Due to its delicate appearance and habitat preferences, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
