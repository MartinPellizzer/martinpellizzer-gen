    "intro": "Columbaria patens, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with four petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Columbaria patens is often found in dry, sunny environments such as cliffs, slopes, and along roadsides."
