It is a low-growing, herbaceous plant that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in arid conditions. Chamaesyce seleri is often found in dune environments and is well-suited to withstand salt spray and strong winds."
