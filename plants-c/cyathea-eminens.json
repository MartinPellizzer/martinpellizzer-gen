    "intro": "Cyathea eminens, commonly known as the tall tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. Its rhizome system supports the growth of the trunk and helps in nutrient absorption from the soil. Cyathea eminens is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests."
