    "intro": "Cistanche deserticola, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic plant native to arid regions of China. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically growing on species of the genus Ephedra. The plant produces yellow flowers and has a unique structure with a swollen, fleshy stem that stores nutrients. It is often found in sandy soils and can thrive in harsh, semi-desert environments. Due to its medicinal properties, it is also valued in traditional Chinese medicine."
