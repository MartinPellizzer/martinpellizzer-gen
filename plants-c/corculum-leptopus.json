    "intro": "Corculum leptopus, commonly known as the slender swamp fern, is a species of aquatic fern found in freshwater wetlands. It has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapting to its water-based habitat. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. It thrives in slow-moving or still water with muddy substrates. Its presence is often an indicator of healthy, undisturbed wetland ecosystems."
