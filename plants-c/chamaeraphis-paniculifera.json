    "intro": "Chamaeraphis paniculifera, commonly known as the sea lentil, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean. It is a small annual herb that thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and in dune environments. The plant produces small, green, lens-shaped seeds that are rich in protein and are used as a food source in some regions. Its flowering stems bear clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant's ability to tolerate salt and drought makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
