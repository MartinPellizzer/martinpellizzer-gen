    "intro": "Chrysodium quoyanum, commonly known as the quoyanum chrysodium, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a glossy surface, while its stems are slender and branching. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
