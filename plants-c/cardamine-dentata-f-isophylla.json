    "intro": "Cardamine dentata f. isophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved watercress, is a variant of the watercress species native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is a perennial herb characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by slender, elongated seed pods. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb due to their peppery flavor. The botanical features of this plant make it well adapted to moist, nutrient-rich habitats."
