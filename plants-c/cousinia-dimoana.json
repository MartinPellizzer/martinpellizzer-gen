It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, exhibiting a low, sprawling growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish or greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its fibrous roots help it retain moisture in harsh, dry environments. Cousinia dimoana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging ecological conditions."
