    "intro": "Ctenopteris bolanica, commonly known as the Bolan cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Pakistan and northern India. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into narrow, linear segments, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows on rocky slopes and cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Ctenopteris bolanica is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
