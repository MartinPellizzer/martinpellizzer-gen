    "intro": "Crepidospermum goudotianum, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night, emitting a strong fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. The plant has opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves, and its stems are woody with a tendency to climb by twining around supports. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The flowers typically bloom in summer and are followed by small, round fruits that contain several seeds."
