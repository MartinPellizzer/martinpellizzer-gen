    "intro": "Cassia brachystachya, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed cassia, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are bipinnate, with numerous small leaflets, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Cassia brachystachya thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for ornamental and ecological landscaping."
