    "intro": "Celtis occidentalis f. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf hackberry, is a compact, slow-growing shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside, giving them a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by small, round berries that ripen to a dark purple color. Its bark is smooth and grayish in youth, becoming fissured with age. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
