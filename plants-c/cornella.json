    "intro": "Cornella, commonly known as the cornel tree or cornel cherry, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cornaceae. It includes several species, such as Cornus sanguinea and Cornus mas, which are native to Europe, Asia, and North America. These plants are characterized by their small, often yellow or red berries and their distinctive, often ornamental foliage. The leaves are typically opposite and have a serrated edge, while the bark is smooth and may have a reddish or grayish hue. Cornella species are valued for their ecological benefits, providing food for birds and other wildlife, and for their use in traditional medicine and horticulture."
