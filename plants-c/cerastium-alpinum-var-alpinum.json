    "intro": "Cerastium alpinum var. alpinum, commonly known as alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are spoon-shaped, hairy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to withstand cold and windy conditions. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountain meadows and alpine tundras. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
