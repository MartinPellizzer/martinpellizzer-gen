    "intro": "Cenchrus heterochaetus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sand couch, is a perennial grass native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species for dryland areas. Its growth habit and drought tolerance make it useful for erosion control and livestock forage in suitable climates."
