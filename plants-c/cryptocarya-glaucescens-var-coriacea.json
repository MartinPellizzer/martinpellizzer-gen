    "intro": "Cryptocarya glaucescens var. coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved cryptocarya, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels, avocado, and cinnamon. The plant is characterized by its thick, coriaceous (leathery) leaves that are often covered in a waxy, glaucous coating. It typically grows in humid, tropical or subtropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. The plant's botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystems, though it is not widely cultivated outside its natural range."
