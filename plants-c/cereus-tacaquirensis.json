    "intro": "Cereus tacaquirensis, commonly known as the Tacaquirensis Cactus, is a species native to northern South America, particularly found in Venezuela and Colombia. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, ribbed stem and sparse, spiny areoles. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its water-storing stems. It produces large, showy flowers that open at night, a trait common among many cacti in the Cereus genus. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
