    "intro": "Cyathea squamulosa, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The fronds are covered in a dense layer of silky, white hairs, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Cyathea squamulosa is valued for its ornamental appearance and historical significance in M\u0101ori culture."
