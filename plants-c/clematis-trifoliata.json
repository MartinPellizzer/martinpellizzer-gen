    "intro": "Clematis trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaved clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to East Asia. It features compound leaves with three leaflets, often with a serrated edge, and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for garden trellises or arbors. Its woody stems can be pruned to encourage flowering and maintain shape. Clematis trifoliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability in various garden settings."
