    "intro": "Carex luctuosa f. brevisquama, commonly known as the short-awned sorrowgrass, is a perennial sedge characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. It typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks, where it thrives in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, a common feature among sedges. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a slightly rough texture, with the distinctive short awns on the bracts of the flowering spikes. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
