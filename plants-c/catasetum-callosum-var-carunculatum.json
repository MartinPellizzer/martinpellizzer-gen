    "intro": "Catasetum callosum var. carunculatum, commonly known as the hooked catasetum, is a striking orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, often yellow or orange flowers with prominent, hooked sepals and petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its inflorescence is usually short and compact, with flowers that open sequentially. Botanically, it is notable for its unique floral structure and the presence of specialized structures called \"caruncles,\" which are small, fleshy appendages on the petals."
