    "intro": "Caragana pumila, commonly known as the dwarf bitterbrush, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its small, compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in poor soils and extreme temperatures. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for wildlife. Caragana pumila is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping in dry climates."
