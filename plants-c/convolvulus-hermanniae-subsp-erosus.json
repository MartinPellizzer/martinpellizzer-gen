    "intro": "Convolvulus hermanniae subsp. erosus, commonly known as Hermann's bindweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its twining stems and heart-shaped leaves, which are typically hairy and lobed. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its rapid growth and aggressive spreading habit make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
