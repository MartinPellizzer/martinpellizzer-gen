    "intro": "Conyza camphorata, commonly known as camphor weed, is a flowering plant native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is an annual herb that grows up to 1 meter tall, with hairy stems and opposite leaves that are lance-shaped and often hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is known for its strong, aromatic scent, which is due to the presence of camphor-like compounds in its tissues. Conyza camphorata is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in some regions."
