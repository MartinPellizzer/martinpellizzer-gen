    "intro": "Carex speciosa subsp. dilatata, commonly known as the broad-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its wide, flat leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, giving them a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical spikes, which are typically borne on tall, slender stems. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
