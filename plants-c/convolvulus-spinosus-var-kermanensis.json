    "intro": "Convolvulus spinosus var. kermanensis, commonly known as the Kerman thornvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny stems and heart-shaped leaves, which help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
