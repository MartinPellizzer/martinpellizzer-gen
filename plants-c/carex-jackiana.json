    "intro": "Carex jackiana, commonly known as Jack's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. Native to the eastern United States, it thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and pond edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable environments."
