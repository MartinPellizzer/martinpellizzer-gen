    "intro": "Cousinia insignis, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight and reduces water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help to minimize transpiration in hot, dry environments. Cousinia insignis is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
