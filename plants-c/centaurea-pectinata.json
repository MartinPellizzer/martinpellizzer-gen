    "intro": "Centaurea pectinata, commonly known as the woolly centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has hairy, silver-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Centaurea pectinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual interest."
