It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in coastal regions and has a shrub-like structure with glossy, dark green leaves. Its flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their nectar-rich nature. Chloraea leontoglossa is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
