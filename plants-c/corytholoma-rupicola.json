    "intro": "Corytholoma rupicola, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in rocky, arid environments, often found on limestone or sandstone surfaces. The plant forms a crust-like growth that is tightly adhered to its substrate, making it difficult to remove. It plays a crucial role in soil formation and nutrient cycling in harsh ecosystems. Due to its specialized habitat, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is often used as an indicator of air quality."
