    "intro": "Croton leonis, commonly known as the lion's tail, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that resemble a lion's tail, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by bright orange or red berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its toxicity should be noted."
