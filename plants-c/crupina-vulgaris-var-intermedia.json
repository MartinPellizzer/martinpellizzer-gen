    "intro": "Crupina vulgaris var. intermedia, commonly known as the coastal bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of Europe and parts of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Due to its salt tolerance and ability to stabilize sandy soils, it plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems."
