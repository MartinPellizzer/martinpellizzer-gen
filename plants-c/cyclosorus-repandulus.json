    "intro": "Cyclosorus repandulus, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a small aquatic fern found in freshwater habitats. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving water, often in shaded environments. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to submerged substrates. The spores are produced in small, clustered sori located on the underside of the fronds."
