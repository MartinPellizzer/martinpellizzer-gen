    "intro": "Campanula grammosepala var. cardiophylla, commonly known as the heart-leaf bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive heart-shaped base, giving it its common name. The plant produces bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers well-drained, rocky soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value lies in its striking foliage and delicate floral display."
