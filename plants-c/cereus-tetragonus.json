    "intro": "Cereus tetragonus, commonly known as the four-angled cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its ribbed, columnar stems that are typically green and covered with white spines. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, blooming at night. It thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for desert conditions. Its structure and adaptations reflect its evolutionary response to harsh, dry climates."
