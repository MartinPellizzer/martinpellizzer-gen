    "intro": "Camellia integrifolia, commonly known as the Japanese camellia, is a species of evergreen shrub native to Japan and Korea. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep red, often with a contrasting throat. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves that are entire, meaning they have no teeth or notches along the edges. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Camellia integrifolia is also valued for its cold hardiness and ability to bloom reliably in winter."
