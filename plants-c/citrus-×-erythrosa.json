    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 erythrosa, commonly known as the blood orange. This hybrid citrus plant is characterized by its distinctive red pigmentation in the flesh of its fruit, primarily due to the presence of anthocyanins. It is a cross between the sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) and the pummelo (Citrus grandis). The plant typically grows as a small evergreen tree with thick, glossy leaves and fragrant white flowers. It is cultivated for its ornamental value and unique, sweet-tart fruit that is often used in culinary and medicinal applications."
