    "intro": "Chamaegastrodia vaginata, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, pouch-like flower that is typically yellow or orange in color. The plant grows in moist, shaded forest understories and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers during the spring. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
