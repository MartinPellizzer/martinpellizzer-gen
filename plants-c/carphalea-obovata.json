It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, obovate-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or undergrowth habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
