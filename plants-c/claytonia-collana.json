    "intro": "Claytonia collana, commonly known as the Sierra Valley spring beauty, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Portulacaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils along streambanks and meadows, preferring cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are prostrate and mat-forming. Claytonia collana is an important early bloomer in alpine and subalpine ecosystems, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
