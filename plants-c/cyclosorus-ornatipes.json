    "intro": "Cyclosorus ornatipes, commonly known as the ornate water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are divided into four lobes, giving it a distinctive, four-leaf clover-like appearance. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands, where it can receive adequate sunlight. Its reproductive structures, including small, yellowish flowers, emerge from the water surface, contributing to its ecological role in aquatic ecosystems. Cyclosorus ornatipes is often used in ornamental water gardens due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of cultivation."
