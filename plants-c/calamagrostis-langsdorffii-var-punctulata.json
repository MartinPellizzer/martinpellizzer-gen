    "intro": "Calamagrostis langsdorffii var. punctulata, commonly known as the dotted reed, is a perennial grass native to eastern Asia. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces feathery, silver-green panicles that bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting various insect and bird species."
