    "intro": "Cardamine flexuosa var. haleakalensis, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 buttercup, is a rare endemic species found exclusively on the island of Maui in Hawaii. It is a herbaceous plant with delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom during the early spring months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
