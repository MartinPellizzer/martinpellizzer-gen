    "intro": "Cohniella \u00d7 francoi, commonly known as the hybrid cohniella, is a rare and intriguing plant species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that resemble those of its parent species, Cohniella sp. and an unidentified parent. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in woodland areas or along streambanks. Its small, yellowish-white flowers are clustered in umbels, a feature common to many members of the carrot family. Due to its rarity and unique genetic makeup, it is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
