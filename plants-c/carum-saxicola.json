It belongs to the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine environments. Its flowers are small and white or pale blue, arranged in umbels, and it produces small, oval seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Carum saxicola is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
