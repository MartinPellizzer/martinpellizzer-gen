It is a vine that produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in dry areas. It blooms in the summer and is adapted to arid environments. The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across various habitats."
