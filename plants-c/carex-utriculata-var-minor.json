    "intro": "Carex utriculata var. minor, commonly known as the small bladder sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its compact, grass-like foliage and the presence of small, bladder-like structures called utricles on its flower spikes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands, stream banks, and forest floors. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of tiny, three-lobed flowers that are often green or reddish in color. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
