    "intro": "Casuarina decussata, commonly known as the coastal she-oak, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like leaves that are arranged in pairs along the branches. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in woody pods, which are dispersed by wind. Casuarina decussata is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
