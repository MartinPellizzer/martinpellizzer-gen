    "intro": "Chiarinia jubae-fluvii, commonly known as the Jordan River willow, is a shrub-like plant native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, typical of many willow species. It thrives in moist, saline soils along riverbanks and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
