    "intro": "Coelogyne macroptera, commonly known as the giant orchid or the large-leafed coelogyne, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, strap-like leaves and its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. Coelogyne macroptera is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
