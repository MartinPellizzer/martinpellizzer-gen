    "intro": "Cheilanthes profusa, commonly known as the rock hound, is a species of fern native to arid and rocky environments in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that form dense, cushion-like clusters, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry conditions. The plant's rhizomes are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients to survive prolonged droughts. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a waxy coating that reduces water loss. Cheilanthes profusa is often found growing on limestone and sandstone, making it a common sight in desert landscapes."
