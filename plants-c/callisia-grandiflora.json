It is a member of the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves covered in a fine, silvery-white bloom. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its ornamental value and ease of care, it is often cultivated in warm climates."
