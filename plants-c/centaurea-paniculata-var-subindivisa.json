    "intro": "Centaurea paniculata var. subindivisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gladiolus, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and striking, bright red to orange flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slight hairy texture. This variant is distinguished by its reduced floral structure compared to the typical form, with fewer florets per inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
