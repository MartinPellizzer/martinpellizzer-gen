    "intro": "Cyperus eragrostis var. melanocephalus, commonly known as black-headed flatsedge, is a grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that are often dark-colored. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas or along waterways. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in wetland environments. The species is characterized by its distinctive dark-colored inflorescences, which give it its common name."
