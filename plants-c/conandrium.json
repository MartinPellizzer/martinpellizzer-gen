    "intro": "Conandrium, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant species characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions. It belongs to the family Conandriaceae and is native to the misty highlands of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments and requires high humidity to flourish. Its flowers, which appear in late spring, are small and pale, often mistaken for fungal growths. Due to its rarity and delicate nature, Conandrium is considered a conservation concern in its natural habitat."
