    "intro": "Cannabis macrosperma, commonly known as the Mexican cannabis or Mexican hemp, is a dioecious plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its tall, fibrous stalks and broad, serrated leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in open fields or along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it distinct from other cannabis species, particularly in its morphology and reproductive structures."
