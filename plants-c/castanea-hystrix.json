    "intro": "Castanea hystrix, commonly known as the prickly chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces catkin-like male flowers and spiny, clustered female flowers, which develop into edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. Its fruits are an important food source for various wildlife species. The tree is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas."
