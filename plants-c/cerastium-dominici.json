    "intro": "Cerastium dominici, commonly known as the snow-in-summer, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, giving it its common name. The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Cerastium dominici is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet habitats."
