    "intro": "Castilleja trujillensis, commonly known as the Trujillo milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers, typically in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually small and opposite, and it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Castilleja trujillensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native ecosystems."
