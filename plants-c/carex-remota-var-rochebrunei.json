    "intro": "Carex remota var. rochebrunei, commonly known as the dwarf sedges, is a perennial sedge native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in dense clusters, reaching heights of up to 15 inches, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
