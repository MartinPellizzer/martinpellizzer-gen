    "intro": "Cyrtandra plectranthiflora, commonly known as the Hawaiian plectranthifoliate cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its herbaceous growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in the humid climate. Its flowers are often visited by native bees and other pollinators, playing a role in the ecological balance of its habitat. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is a focus of conservation efforts in Hawaii."
