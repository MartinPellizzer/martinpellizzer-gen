    "intro": "Cassiope tetragona subsp. saximontana, commonly known as the Sierra cushion plant, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often forming dense cushions to protect itself from harsh weather conditions. The plant features small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a white, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems during the spring and summer months. This subspecies is well adapted to alpine environments and is an important component of the local flora in its habitat."
