    "intro": "Cremanthodium citriflorum, commonly known as the citronflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a rounded inflorescence, often resembling a cluster of small citrus fruits, hence its common name. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, arid climates. The plant is also noted for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in local herbal remedies."
