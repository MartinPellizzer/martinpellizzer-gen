    "intro": "Clerodendrum venosum var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy spiderling, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale pink flowers, which are often followed by distinctive, spiny capsules. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and have a slightly hairy surface. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
