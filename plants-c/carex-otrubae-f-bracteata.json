    "intro": "Carex otrubae f. bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate sedge, is a variant of the Carex otrubae species, which belongs to the Cyperaceae family. This plant is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wetlands, and is often found in temperate regions. The bracteate form is distinguished by the presence of bracts, which are modified leaves that surround the flowering structures. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat diversity."
