    "intro": "Cyclamen cilicium f. album, commonly known as the white cyclamen, is a rare and striking variant of the cyclamen genus. It is characterized by its pale, almost white or cream-colored foliage and flowers, which contrast sharply with the typical red or pink hues of its parent species. Native to the mountainous regions of Turkey, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its unique coloration makes it a sought-after ornamental plant in botanical gardens and specialized collections. The plant's foliage and flowers are both showy, contributing to its appeal in horticultural settings."
