    "intro": "Cantua brevifolia, commonly known as the alpine campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its clusters of pink or white flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine environments. Its leaves are typically hairy and oval-shaped, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. Cantua brevifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy, colorful blooms."
