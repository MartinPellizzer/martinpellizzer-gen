    "intro": "Celtis eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly apple tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its grayish bark, small elliptical leaves with a hairy underside, and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically covered in a whitish bloom, which gives it its common name. Celtis eriocarpa is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature."
