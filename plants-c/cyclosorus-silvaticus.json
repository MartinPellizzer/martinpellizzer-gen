    "intro": "Cyclosorus silvaticus, commonly known as the forest cyclosorus, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in dense clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are arranged in a spiral pattern. Cyclosorus silvaticus plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
