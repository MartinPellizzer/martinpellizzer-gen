It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and fleshy, succulent stems. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale green, often with a distinctive hood-like structure. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Ceropegia stenoloba is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to trail from hanging baskets or shelves."
