    "intro": "Carex tomentosa subsp. subvillosa, commonly known as the silky sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its hairy, soft foliage gives it a distinctive appearance, making it a notable species in ecological and horticultural contexts."
