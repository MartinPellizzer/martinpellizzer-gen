    "intro": "Carex sparganioides var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf swamp sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes and pond edges. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often submerged or partially submerged. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
