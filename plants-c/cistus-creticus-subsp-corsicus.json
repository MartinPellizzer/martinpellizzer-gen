It is characterized by its aromatic, evergreen leaves and clusters of small, pink to white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its resinous leaves emit a strong, distinctive scent, which is used in traditional medicine and perfumery. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
