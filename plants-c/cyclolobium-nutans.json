    "intro": "Cyclolobium nutans, commonly known as the drooping burr legume, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces distinctive, pod-like fruits that hang downward. The plant is characterized by its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Cyclolobium nutans thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in botanical studies."
