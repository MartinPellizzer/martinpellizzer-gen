    "intro": "Chamaefilix lunulata var. harpeodes, commonly known as the Harpe's rockfoxtail, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are followed by three-angled, bristly seed capsules. It is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and woodland edges. Its hardy nature and ability to tolerate drought make it a resilient plant in its native range."
