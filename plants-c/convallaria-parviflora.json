    "intro": "Convallaria parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered lily of the valley, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, arching stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers, which are typically fragrant. The plant produces bright red berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and evergreen, forming a dense ground cover. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky habitats."
