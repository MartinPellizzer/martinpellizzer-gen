    "intro": "Cynosurus glaber, commonly known as the rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, wiry stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, rough hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle bearing small, spikelet-like flowers. Cynosurus glaber is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
