    "intro": "Cyathea rebeccae, commonly known as the Rebecca's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds, which are released into the air for dispersal. Cyathea rebeccae plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various organisms."
