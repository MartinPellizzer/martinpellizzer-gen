    "intro": "Crataegus xeromorpha, commonly known as the sand hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, elliptical leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Crataegus xeromorpha is adapted to drought conditions and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Its botanical features make it an important plant in both ecological and ornamental contexts."
