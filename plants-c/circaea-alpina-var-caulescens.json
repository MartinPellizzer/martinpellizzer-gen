    "intro": "Circaea alpina var. caulescens, commonly known as the alpine wood sorrel, is a perennial herb native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with slender, often hairy stems that produce small, white or pale yellow flowers. The leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and the plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous areas with limited soil cover. This variety is distinguished by its more robust stems compared to the typical form of Circaea alpina."
