    "intro": "Carex minutissima, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to moist, shady environments in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than an inch in width, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wet or damp soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along stream edges. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking to add texture and interest to woodland gardens."
