    "intro": "Chrysothamnus nauseosus var. gnaphalodes, commonly known as the yellow rabbitbrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellow to golden-green foliage and produces fluffy, yellow flower clusters that bloom in the spring. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats. The species is adapted to full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy plant in semi-arid regions."
