It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible for humans and some bird species, and they contribute to the plant's ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable choice for garden landscapes."
