    "intro": "Croixia herveyi, commonly known as the Hervey's crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, brightly colored flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
