It is characterized by its spiny, blue-green colored leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to the western United States, it thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its distinctive appearance and hardy nature make it a notable species in ecological studies and horticultural practices."
