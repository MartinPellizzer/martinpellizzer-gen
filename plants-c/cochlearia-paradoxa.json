    "intro": "Cochlearia paradoxa, commonly known as the paradox carnation, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers, which are pink or white, bloom in early summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
