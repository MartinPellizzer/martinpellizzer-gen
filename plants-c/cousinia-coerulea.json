    "intro": "Cousinia coerulea, commonly known as the blue cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cousinia coerulea is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
