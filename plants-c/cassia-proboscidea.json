    "intro": "Cassia proboscidea, commonly known as the winged bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, wing-like structures on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces long, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds and a starchy, protein-rich pulp. Cassia proboscidea is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a valuable crop for sustainable agriculture. It is also valued for its nutritional content, including high levels of protein and essential minerals."
