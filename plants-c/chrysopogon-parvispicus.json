    "intro": "Chrysopogon parvispicus, commonly known as the small-headed grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of hairs. Chrysopogon parvispicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
