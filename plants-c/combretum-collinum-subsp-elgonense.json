It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often pubescent and have a distinctive elliptical shape. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. This species is adapted to a variety of habitats, including moist forests and rocky areas, and is often found in the montane regions of Kenya and Uganda."
