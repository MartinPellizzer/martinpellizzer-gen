    "intro": "Cardamine integrifolia var. diversifolia, commonly known as the variable watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, temperate regions. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, alternate leaves that are often glossy and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early spring. Its roots are edible and have a peppery flavor similar to watercress, making it a valued wild vegetable. It thrives in shady, wet environments such as stream banks and woodland floors."
