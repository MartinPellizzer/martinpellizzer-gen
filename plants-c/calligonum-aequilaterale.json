    "intro": "Calligonum aequilaterale, commonly known as the four-angled saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive quadrangular stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a hardy species for harsh environments. Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, contributing to its resilience in drought conditions."
