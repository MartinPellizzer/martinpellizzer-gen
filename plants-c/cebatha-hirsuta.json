It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with ray florets surrounding a central disk. Cebatha hirsuta is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in full sun."
