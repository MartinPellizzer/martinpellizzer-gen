    "intro": "Couralia toxophora, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its waxy, fleshy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant thrives in saline environments and is often found in estuaries and mangrove swamps. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Couralia toxophora plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial organisms."
