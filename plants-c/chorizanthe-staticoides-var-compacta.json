    "intro": "Chorizanthe staticoides var. compacta, commonly known as the compact choris, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring to early summer. It has a deep taproot system, allowing it to survive in poor soils and drought conditions. The compact growth habit of this variety makes it well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
