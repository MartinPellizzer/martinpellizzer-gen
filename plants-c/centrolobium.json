    "intro": "Centrolobium, commonly known as the \"brazil nut tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid, lowland forests. The tree is notable for producing large, woody pods that contain the edible seeds used to make Brazil nuts. Its leaves are typically compound, with a feathery appearance, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that attract various pollinators. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting biodiversity and contributing to soil fertility through nitrogen fixation."
