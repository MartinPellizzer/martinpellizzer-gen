    "intro": "Chloris pubescens, commonly known as rough brome, is a grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and dense, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Chloris pubescens is often used in ecological restoration due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
