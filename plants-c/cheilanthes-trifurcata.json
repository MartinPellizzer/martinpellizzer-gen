    "intro": "Cheilanthes trifurcata, commonly known as the three-branched rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. It produces spores in small, clustered clusters on the underside of its fronds. Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
