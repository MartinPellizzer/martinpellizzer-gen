    "intro": "Cheiranthus aridus, commonly known as the desertflix, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Cheiranthus aridus plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides nectar for pollinators in its habitat."
