    "intro": "Corylus ferox var. tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan hazel, is a variant of the common hazel native to high-altitude regions of Tibet. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its robust, branched stems and oval, serrated leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, spiny nuts enclosed in a cupule, which are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. This variety is valued for its hardiness and potential use in ecological restoration projects."
