It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, which give it its varietal name \"dentata.\" The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms."
