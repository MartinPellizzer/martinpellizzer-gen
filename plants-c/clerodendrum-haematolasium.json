It is characterized by its striking red-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with opposite, ovate leaves that are usually green with a slightly hairy texture. Its bark contains compounds that have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory properties. The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions."
