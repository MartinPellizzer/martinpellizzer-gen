It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus Cirsium. It typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands at high altitudes. The flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
