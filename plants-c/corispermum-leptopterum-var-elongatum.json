    "intro": "Corispermum leptopterum var. elongatum, commonly known as the long-leaved sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is a small annual herb with erect, branching stems that often grow in sandy or gravelly soils. The leaves are linear and usually covered with fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces capsules that contain numerous seeds. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local wildlife."
