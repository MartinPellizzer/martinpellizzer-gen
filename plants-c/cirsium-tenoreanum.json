    "intro": "Cirsium tenoreanum, commonly known as the alpine thistle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its spiny, serrated leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its growth habit is upright, with a compact form that allows it to withstand harsh weather conditions. Cirsium tenoreanum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in subalpine and alpine meadows."
