    "intro": "Carduus pinetorum, commonly known as the pine thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and forest edges. The plant features a robust taproot and upright stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are deeply lobed, with a rough, hairy texture, and are covered in a white, waxy coating. The flowers are yellow and are arranged in a single, terminal head, with bracts that are often mistaken for leaves."
