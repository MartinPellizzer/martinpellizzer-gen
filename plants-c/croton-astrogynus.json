    "intro": "Croton astrogynus, commonly known as the red croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, colorful foliage, with leaves that can range from bright red to deep orange and green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
