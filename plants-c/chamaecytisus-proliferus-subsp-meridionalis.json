It is characterized by its dense, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, woody stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are small, leathery, and evergreen, providing year-round cover. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal and rocky habitats."
