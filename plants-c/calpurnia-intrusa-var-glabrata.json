    "intro": "Calpurnia intrusa var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth calpurnia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its legume fruits and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being elliptical and smooth in texture, hence the species name *glabrata*. The flowers are yellow with a distinctive dark purple or black calyx, and they bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
