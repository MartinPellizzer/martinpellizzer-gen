    "intro": "Connarus opacus, commonly known as the blackwood tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, including countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its dark, almost black bark, which gives it its common name. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a glossy surface, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
