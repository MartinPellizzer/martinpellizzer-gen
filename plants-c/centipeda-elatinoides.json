    "intro": "Centipeda elatinoides, commonly known as the glassworts, is a halophytic plant that thrives in saline and coastal environments. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which help it retain water in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically arranged in dense clusters. It is often found in salt marshes, estuaries, and other coastal habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Centipeda elatinoides is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
