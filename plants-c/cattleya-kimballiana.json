    "intro": "Cattleya kimballiana, commonly known as the Kimball's orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, large, and showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Cattleya kimballiana is prized in horticulture for its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
