    "intro": "Ctenitis atrogrisea, commonly known as the black-stemmed rock fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, wiry stems and fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Ctenitis atrogrisea is often found growing on limestone or in humid, tropical climates where it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
