    "intro": "Campanula patula var. decurrens, commonly known as the spreading bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branching stems that often spread horizontally, giving it a cascading appearance. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and slightly serrated. It is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, and as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value."
