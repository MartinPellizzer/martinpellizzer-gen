    "intro": "Cenchrus pallidus, commonly known as the pale sandgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, silver-green leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale yellow to brown florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its fibrous roots contribute to soil stabilization, making it useful in erosion control. Cenchrus pallidus is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
