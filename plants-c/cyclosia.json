    "intro": "Cyclosia, commonly known as the cyclosia or the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its daisy-like flowers, which typically have yellow centers and white petals. The plant is native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in the southern United States and parts of Mexico. Cyclosia species are often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. They are typically herbaceous perennials, with some species growing as annuals, and they produce small, wind-dispersed seeds."
