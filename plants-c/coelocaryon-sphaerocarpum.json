It is characterized by its distinctive, spherical fruiting bodies that resemble small, floating globes. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its morphology includes a slender, branched stem with small, scale-like leaves. Coelocaryon sphaerocarpum is notable for its limited distribution and is considered a relic species with a specialized ecological niche."
