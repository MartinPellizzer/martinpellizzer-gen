    "intro": "Coralliokyphos, commonly known as the coral-like clubmoss, is a unique plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its branching, stem-like structures that resemble coral, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches. Its leaves are narrow and scale-like, contributing to its overall appearance. Coralliokyphos thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity."
