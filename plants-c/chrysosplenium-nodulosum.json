    "intro": "Chrysosplenium nodulosum, commonly known as the clustered spleenwort, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Spleenworts (Aspleniaceae). It is characterized by its dense, rosette-like growth habit and small, kidney-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces tiny, clustered spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are typically found on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Chrysosplenium nodulosum is a delicate plant that plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat."
