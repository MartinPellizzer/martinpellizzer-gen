    "intro": "Calamus fasciculatus, commonly known as the clustered rattan, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its long, flexible stems. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of many rattan species. Its leaves are generally pinnate, with a smooth or slightly serrated edge. Calamus fasciculatus is often used in traditional crafts and as a source of rattan for furniture due to its durable and flexible nature."
