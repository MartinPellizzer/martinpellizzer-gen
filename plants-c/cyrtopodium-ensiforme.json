    "intro": "Cyrtopodium ensiforme, commonly known as the sword orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that resemble a sword, hence its common name. The plant produces pendulous, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, narrow lip. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Cyrtopodium ensiforme is often cultivated for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
