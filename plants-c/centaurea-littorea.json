    "intro": "Centaurea littorea, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers and spiny, silver-green leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong winds. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, thriving in maritime climates. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Centaurea littorea is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
