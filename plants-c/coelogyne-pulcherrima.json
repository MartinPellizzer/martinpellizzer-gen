    "intro": "Coelogyne pulcherrima, commonly known as the flame orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fiery red and orange flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in shaded forest environments. Its leaves are typically elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps reduce water loss. Coelogyne pulcherrima is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
