    "intro": "Cibotium djambianum, commonly known as the Djambian tree fern, is a member of the Dicksoniaceae family and is native to the tropical rainforests of New Guinea. It is a large, tree-like fern that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with a thick, fibrous trunk and a crown of compound fronds. The plant has a distinctive, segmented trunk that is covered in a layer of dead fronds, which provide insulation and protection. Its fronds are bi-directionally arranged, with the upper ones being fertile and the lower ones sterile. The plant is adapted to humid, shaded environments and plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
