It is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, whitish hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically arranged in a raceme. Its stems are usually erect and branched, often growing up to 30 cm in height. The hairy goosefoot is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny environments."
