    "intro": "Cotoneaster vulgaris var. leucocarpus, commonly known as the white-fruited cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its distinctive white or pale yellow berries that persist through winter. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by the development of its unique, fleshy, seed-containing fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness. The variety is notable for its adaptability to various climates and its ability to form thickets in suitable environments."
