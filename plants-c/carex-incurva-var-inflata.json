    "intro": "Carex incurva var. inflata, commonly known as the inflated sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is characterized by its upright, narrow leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The inflated bracts of the flower head give it its common name and contribute to its distinctive appearance."
