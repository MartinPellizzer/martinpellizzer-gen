    "intro": "Cerastium cerastoides var. subglaberrimum, commonly known as the smooth rock chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically features small, oval-shaped leaves that are densely packed along its stems, which are often prostrate or ascending. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender pedicels. Its leaves are usually covered with a fine layer of hairs, though the variety subglaberrimum is distinguished by its reduced or absent pubescence. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
