    "intro": "Calyptranthes monteverdensis, commonly known as the Monteverde calyptranthes, is a small evergreen shrub native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in umbels, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the cool, misty conditions of its high-altitude habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
