    "intro": "Cynodon mucronatus, commonly known as the Cape grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves with a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically greenish or reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and along coastal areas. Cynodon mucronatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in erosion control due to its hardy nature."
