    "intro": "Cereus salm-dyckianus, commonly known as the Salm-Dyck's candleplant, is a succulent cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces large, night-blooming flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its stems are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
