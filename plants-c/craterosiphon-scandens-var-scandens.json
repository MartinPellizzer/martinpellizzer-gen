    "intro": "Craterosiphon scandens var. scandens, commonly known as the creeping rockweed, is a marine green alga that thrives in intertidal zones. It is characterized by its filamentous growth habit and the presence of air bladders that help it float and remain buoyant. The plant has a simple morphology with a central axis and lateral branches, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. It is often found attached to rocks or other substrates in shallow coastal waters. Its ability to tolerate fluctuating salinity and temperature makes it a resilient species in dynamic marine environments."
