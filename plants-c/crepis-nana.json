    "intro": "Crepis nana, commonly known as the dwarf mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant's compact size and dense growth habit make it well-suited for ground cover in garden settings. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
