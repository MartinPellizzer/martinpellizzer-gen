    "intro": "Conyza cinerea, commonly known as hoary conyza, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its grayish-white foliage and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It produces numerous small seeds that are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread easily. Conyza cinerea is often considered a weed but has ecological value as a source of nectar for pollinators."
