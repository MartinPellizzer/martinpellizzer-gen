    "intro": "Caralluma parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of India and Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom at night. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. Caralluma parviflora is also noted for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of bioactive compounds."
