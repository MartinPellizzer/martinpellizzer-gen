    "intro": "Centropogon ursinus, commonly known as the bear's foot plant, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that resemble the paw of a bear, hence its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in wetlands or along riverbanks. Centropogon ursinus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
