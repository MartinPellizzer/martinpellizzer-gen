    "intro": "Corymbia chippendalei, commonly known as the Chippendale's blood gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the northwestern region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey to pinkish bark that peels in thin, flaky sheets. The tree produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a waxy coating. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and flowering habit."
