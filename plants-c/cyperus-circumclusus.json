    "intro": "Cyperus circumclusus, commonly known as the clustered flatsedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and shallow water areas. The plant has grass-like leaves that are arranged in dense clusters around the base, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually clustered in spikelets, and it produces small, three-angled fruits. Cyperus circumclusus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic habitats."
