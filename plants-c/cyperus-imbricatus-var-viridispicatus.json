    "intro": "Cyperus imbricatus var. viridispicatus, commonly known as the green-bracted flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically green with a slight reddish tinge along the veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which are borne on short, leafy stems. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a common wetland species and a potential weed in aquatic habitats."
