    "intro": "Clypeola jonthlaspi f. lanata, commonly known as the hairy clypeola, is a variant of the species Clypeola jonthlaspi, characterized by its distinctive hairy foliage. This plant belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important flowering plants. It is typically found in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The hairy texture of its leaves is an adaptation that helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in racemes, adding to its botanical interest."
