    "intro": "Connarus simplicifolius, commonly known as the simple-leaved connarus, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its family."
