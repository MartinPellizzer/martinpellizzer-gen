    "intro": "Combretum seretii, commonly known as the red-leaf combretum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking red to orange leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicle-like inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release small, winged seeds. Combretum seretii is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
