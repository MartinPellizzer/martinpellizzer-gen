It features slender, twining stems that can grow up to 20 feet in length, supporting its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow to orange flowers in late spring to early summer, which are often adorned with a distinctive red or orange center. Its foliage is characterized by heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and a striking, flame-like appearance.
