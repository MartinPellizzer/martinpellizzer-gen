    "intro": "Carex festiva var. pachystachya, commonly known as the broad-stalked sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation in suitable habitats."
