    "intro": "Cattleya \u00d7 maronii, commonly known as the Maronii Cattleya, is a hybrid orchid prized for its vibrant, fragrant flowers. It originates from a cross between Cattleya labiata and Cattleya moschata, resulting in a plant with distinctive traits from both parents. The orchid features long, pendulous flower spikes that bear multiple blossoms, each with a velvety texture and a complex, intricate pattern. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its beauty and ease of cultivation, it is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
