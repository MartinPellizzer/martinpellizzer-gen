    "intro": "Cola cordifolia var. maclaudii, commonly known as Maclaud's cola, is a species native to West Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into elliptical, woody pods. Each pod contains several seeds enclosed in a gelatinous sac, which are often used in traditional medicine. This variant is distinguished by its unique leaf shape and habitat preferences compared to other Cola species."
