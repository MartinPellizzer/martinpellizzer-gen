    "intro": "Conchocarpus insignis, commonly known as the rock apple or wild apple, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows in coastal or rocky areas. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by edible, fleshy fruits resembling small apples. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The species is valued for its fruit, which is used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some regions."
