    "intro": "Cassytha pergracilis, commonly known as the slender cassytha, is a herbaceous vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, serpentine stems that often trail along the ground or climb over other vegetation. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate, with a smooth texture and a slightly glossy surface. Cassytha pergracilis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands, where it thrives in humid conditions."
