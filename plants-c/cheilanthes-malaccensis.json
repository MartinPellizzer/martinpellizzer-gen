It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and in shaded, humid environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The leaves are usually lanceolate and have a leathery texture, which helps it withstand dry conditions."
