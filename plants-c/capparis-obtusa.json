    "intro": "Capparis obtusa, commonly known as the rock caper, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, green, berry-like fruits that turn red when mature. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy layer, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Capparis obtusa is adapted to rocky and coastal environments, making it a resilient and hardy species."
