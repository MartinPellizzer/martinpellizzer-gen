    "intro": "Carex indica var. fissilis, commonly known as the fissured sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wetlands, and stream banks. Its flowering stems produce small, clustered spikes of greenish-yellow flowers, which are wind-pollinated. The species is noted for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
