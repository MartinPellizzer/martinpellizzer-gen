    "intro": "Cuscuta choisiana, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is native to North America and can be found growing on a variety of plants, including grasses and shrubs. Its life cycle involves germinating from seeds and establishing a connection with the host's vascular system. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and ornamental plants."
