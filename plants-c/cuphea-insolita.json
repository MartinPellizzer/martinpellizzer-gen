    "intro": "Cuphea insolita, commonly known as the flame flower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red flowers that resemble flames, which bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant has hairy, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated edge, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant appearance and ability to attract hummingbirds. Cuphea insolita is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers."
