    "intro": "Cola numbi, commonly known as the African cola tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to West Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into hard, woody fruits containing several seeds. The seeds are often used to make caffeine-rich beverages, similar to the more well-known cola acuminata. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks."
