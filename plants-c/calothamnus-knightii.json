It is characterized by its striking red or orange cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for dry gardens. The botanical features of Calothamnus knightii make it a valuable addition to native flora collections and ecological restoration projects."
