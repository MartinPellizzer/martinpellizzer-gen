    "intro": "Cytisanthus sessilifolius, commonly known as the dwarf lantern tree, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact size and clusters of small, lantern-shaped yellow flowers. The plant produces woody capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a petiole. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
