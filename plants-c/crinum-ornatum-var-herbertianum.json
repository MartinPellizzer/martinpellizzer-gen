    "intro": "Crinum ornatum var. herbertianum, commonly known as Herbert's crinum, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer, often in clusters at the top of its tall, narrow stems. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are broad at the base and taper towards the tips. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
