    "intro": "Cotoneaster vulgaris var. macrophyllus, commonly known as the large-leaf cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically larger than those of the typical species, often reaching lengths of up to 5 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile ornamental plant. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a popular choice for garden landscaping."
