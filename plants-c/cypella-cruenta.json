    "intro": "Cypella cruenta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cypella, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
