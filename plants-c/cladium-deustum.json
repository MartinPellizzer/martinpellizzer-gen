    "intro": "Cladium deustum, commonly known as the swamp cordgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered along the upper part of the stems. Cladium deustum thrives in saturated soils and plays an important role in stabilizing shoreline ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to the structural complexity of wetland habitats."
