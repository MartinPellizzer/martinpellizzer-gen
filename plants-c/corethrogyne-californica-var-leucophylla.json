    "intro": "Corethrogyne californica var. leucophylla, commonly known as the white-leaf corethrogyne, is a rare and endemic plant species native to California. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, silver-white foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in coastal areas, where it thrives in full sun. Its delicate, fern-like leaves are often covered in a fine, powdery coating that reflects sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
