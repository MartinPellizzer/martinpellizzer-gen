    "intro": "Crinum spirale, commonly known as the spiral lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive spiral pattern on the petals. The plant produces large, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its native arid environment. It blooms during the summer months, adding a dramatic visual element to gardens and natural landscapes. Crinum spirale is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively hardy in mild climates."
