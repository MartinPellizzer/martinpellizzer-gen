    "intro": "Caragana, commonly known as the bitterbrush, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of shrubs and small trees native to temperate and cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are characterized by their compound leaves, which are often reduced to small, scale-like structures in some species. Caragana species are known for their yellow to orange flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pods that contain seeds. These plants are adapted to harsh environments and are often found in dry, rocky areas."
