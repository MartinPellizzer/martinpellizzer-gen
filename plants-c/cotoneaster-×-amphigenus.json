    "intro": "Cotoneaster \u00d7 amphigenus, commonly known as the hybrid cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub that exhibits a blend of characteristics from its parent species, Cotoneaster horizontalis and Cotoneaster horizontalis var. amphigenus. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, compact growth with thorny stems and alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
