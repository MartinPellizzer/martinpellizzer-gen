    "intro": "Cyclosorus siamensis, commonly known as the Siam cyclosorus, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in freshwater environments such as streams and ponds, where it attaches itself to rocks or submerged vegetation. The plant has finely divided, ribbon-like fronds that are often submerged, contributing to its ornamental appeal in aquatic gardens. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Cyclosorus siamensis is valued for its ability to improve water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
