    "intro": "Chamaecrista fagonioides var. macrocalyx, commonly known as the broad-leaved Crown Vetch, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves with broad, ovate leaflets and produces erect, sparsely branched stems. The plant is characterized by its yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its trifoliate leaves and papilionaceous flowers are typical of the Fabaceae family. It is often used in erosion control due to its extensive root system and nitrogen-fixing ability."
