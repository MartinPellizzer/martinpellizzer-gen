    "intro": "Cyperus flavescens subsp. tanaensis, commonly known as the Tana flatsedge, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and seasonally flooded areas. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common component of aquatic vegetation. The species is adapted to high moisture conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
