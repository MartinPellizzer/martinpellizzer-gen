    "intro": "Cancrinia goloskokovii, commonly known as the Himalayan snowbell, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to protect against frost. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
