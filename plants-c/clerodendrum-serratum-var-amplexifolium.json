    "intro": "Clerodendrum serratum var. amplexifolium, commonly known as the clinging leaf clerodendrum, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that wrap around its stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. These flowers are followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
