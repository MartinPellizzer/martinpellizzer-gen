    "intro": "Cyanea pilosa var. glabrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf Cyanea, is a rare Hawaiian endemic plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments on the islands of Hawaii. It is often found in the understory of mesic to wet forest habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
