It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically blue to violet in color. The leaves are lanceolate and often have a hairy texture, adapted to thrive in well-drained soils. This subspecies is noted for its hardiness and ability to flourish in harsh, sunny environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine collections."
