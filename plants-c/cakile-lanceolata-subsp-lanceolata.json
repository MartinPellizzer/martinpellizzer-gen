    "intro": "Cakile lanceolata subsp. lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along roadsides, disturbed areas, and dry open habitats."
