    "intro": "Caracalla pulcherrima, commonly known as the flame flower, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting hummingbirds and other pollinators. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves that provide a striking contrast to its brilliant floral display. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
