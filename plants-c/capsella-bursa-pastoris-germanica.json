    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris germanica, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white or pink flowers and has a hairy, prostrate stem that often forms dense mats. The plant's leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its fruits are small, bladder-like structures called silicles. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Botanically, it is notable for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas."
