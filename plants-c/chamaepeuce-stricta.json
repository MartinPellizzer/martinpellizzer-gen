    "intro": "Chamaepeuce stricta, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive red foliage in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically palmately lobed with a pointed tip, and they turn vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow in autumn. Chamaepeuce stricta is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
