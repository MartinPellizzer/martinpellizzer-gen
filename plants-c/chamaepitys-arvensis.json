    "intro": "Chamaepitys arvensis, commonly known as field birch, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters and is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a serrated margin and a pointed tip. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands, riverbanks, and open areas."
