    "intro": "Coffea neurophylla, commonly known as the African coffee tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that contain the seeds used for coffee production. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
