    "intro": "Cremanthodium delavayi, commonly known as the Delavay's globeflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Asia, particularly in China. It belongs to the family Calthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive globular inflorescence, which consists of numerous small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers range in color from white to pink. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, Cremanthodium delavayi is considered a rare and specialized species."
