These plants are characterized by their striking blue or violet flowers, which often resemble small bells. Cyanotis species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. They have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, clustered inflorescences. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens."
