It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variant is distinguished by its unique morphological features compared to other members of the Cyathea genus."
