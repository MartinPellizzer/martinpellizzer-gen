    "intro": "Chaerophyllum crinitum, commonly known as the hairy chaerophyllum, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance and help it retain moisture in humid conditions."
