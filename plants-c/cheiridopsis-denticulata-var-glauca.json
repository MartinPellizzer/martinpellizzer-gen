It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water. The plant produces small, bright blue or violet flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
