    "intro": "Catalpa brevipes var. ekmaniana, commonly known as the dwarf catalpa, is a compact, deciduous tree or shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5 to 7 inches long, with a distinctive wavy margin. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in clusters, usually white or pale yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its small, elongated fruit pods split open to release seeds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade. This variety is known for its slower growth rate and adaptability to a range of soil types."
