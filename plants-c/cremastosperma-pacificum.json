    "intro": "Cremastosperma pacificum, commonly known as the Pacific burrweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces distinctive, spiny fruits that contain seeds with a hard, protective coating. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed coastal habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the harsh, windy conditions of its native environment."
