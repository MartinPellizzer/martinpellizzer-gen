    "intro": "Ctenodon histrix var. incanus, commonly known as the silver hair fern, is a striking epiphytic fern native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and indirect light. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to trees or other surfaces in its natural habitat. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums."
