    "intro": "Campanula asperuloides subsp. taygetea, commonly known as the Taygetean bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features erect stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a rough texture due to their hairy surface. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive blooms."
