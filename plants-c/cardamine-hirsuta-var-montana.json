    "intro": "Cardamine hirsuta var. montana, commonly known as mountain hawksbeard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a raceme. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cooler, humid conditions. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
