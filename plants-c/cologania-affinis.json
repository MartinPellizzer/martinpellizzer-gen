    "intro": "Cologania affinis, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring slender, erect stems covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Cologania affinis plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and provides nectar for pollinators."
