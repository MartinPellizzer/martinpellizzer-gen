    "intro": "Cardamine pratensis var. flaccida, commonly known as the slender water crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist meadows and wetlands in temperate regions. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from May to July. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting aquatic invertebrates and as an indicator of water quality."
