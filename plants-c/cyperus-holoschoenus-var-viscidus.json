    "intro": "Cyperus holoschoenus var. viscidus, commonly known as the sticky flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and dense, cylindrical clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that are typically green or brown in color. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in coastal areas, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its sticky, glandular surfaces give it a distinctive texture and aid in its identification."
