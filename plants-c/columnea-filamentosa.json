    "intro": "Columnea filamentosa, commonly known as the thread-leaved flame flower, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting hummingbirds and other pollinators. The plant has opposite, narrowly elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Columnea filamentosa is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its vibrant blooms and compact growth habit."
