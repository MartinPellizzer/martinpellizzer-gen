It features small, fragrant, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, twining stems and heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are smaller than those of the typical Clematis orientalis. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, fertile soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental value and is often used in gardens for its elegant flowering display."
