    "intro": "Cotoneaster globosus, commonly known as the globular cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and produces small, orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. The plant has pinnate leaves that turn yellow in the autumn, adding seasonal interest. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a hedge. Cotoneaster globosus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
