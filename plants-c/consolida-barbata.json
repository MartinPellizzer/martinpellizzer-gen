    "intro": "Consolida barbata, commonly known as the scarlet pimpernel, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive, spurred petals. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that open in the morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Consolida barbata is often found in disturbed soils and is a popular garden plant due to its vibrant color and ease of cultivation."
