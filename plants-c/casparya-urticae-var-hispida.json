    "intro": "Casparya urticae var. hispida, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its serrated, heart-shaped leaves and dense covering of fine, hollow hairs that can cause a stinging sensation upon contact. The plant typically grows up to 1 meter in height and produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, nitrogen-rich soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as fields and along roadsides. The plant has a long history of use in traditional medicine and as a food source when cooked."
