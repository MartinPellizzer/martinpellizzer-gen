It is a member of the fern family, characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. The plant typically has finely divided, pinnate leaves that are usually dark green with a reddish or blackish stem. It is often found in shallow, still water such as ponds and wetlands. Its unique appearance and habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study and ecological research."
