It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its seeds are small and dispersed by the wind. Carduus cerinthoides is often considered a weed but can serve as a food source for certain insects and livestock."
