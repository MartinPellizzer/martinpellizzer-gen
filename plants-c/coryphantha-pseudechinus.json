    "intro": "Coryphantha pseudechinus, commonly known as the false echinocactus, is a species of cactus native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless plant with a globular or cylindrical stem that often develops a woolly covering. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
