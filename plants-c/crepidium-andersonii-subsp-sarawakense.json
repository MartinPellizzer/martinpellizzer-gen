    "intro": "Crepidium andersonii subsp. sarawakense, commonly known as the Sarawak orchid, is a rare terrestrial orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the undergrowth of dense forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
