    "intro": "Cyperus kappleri, commonly known as the umbrella plant, is a species of sedge native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and distinctive, umbrella-shaped inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along water bodies. Its leaves are narrow and sword-shaped, with a smooth texture, while its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize soil. Cyperus kappleri is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive appearance and adaptability to various water conditions."
