    "intro": "Caryophyllea, commonly known as the pink fairy tern, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom during the warmer months. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils near the coast, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, round fruits that contain numerous seeds. Caryophyllea is an important component of coastal ecosystems and is often found in dune habitats."
