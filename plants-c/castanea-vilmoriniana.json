    "intro": "Castanea vilmoriniana, commonly known as the Vilmorin chestnut, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, palmately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by spiny, oval-shaped fruits known as nuts. These nuts are encased in a thick, woody husk and are typically harvested in the autumn."
