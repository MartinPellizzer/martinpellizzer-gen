    "intro": "Carlina olympica, commonly known as the Olympic carline thistle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly the Alps and the Pyrenees. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features a robust, upright stem covered in soft, woolly hairs, and its basal leaves are broad and lobed with a rough texture. Its showy, purple-blue flower heads appear in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Carlina olympica is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments."
