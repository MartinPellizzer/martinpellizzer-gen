    "intro": "Cynanchum oleifolium, commonly known as the fat hen or wild cucumber, is a climbing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into spiny, berry-like fruits. The plant contains various bioactive compounds, including alkaloids and saponins, which contribute to its medicinal properties. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in woodland or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it both a valuable medicinal plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
