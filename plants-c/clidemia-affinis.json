    "intro": "Clidemia affinis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically white or pink, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Clidemia affinis is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments, making it a common weed in disturbed habitats. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge in agricultural settings."
