    "intro": "Cystopteris tristis, commonly known as the slender shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, which are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium. Cystopteris tristis is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
