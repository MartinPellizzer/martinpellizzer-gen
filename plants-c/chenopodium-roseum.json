    "intro": "Chenopodium roseum, commonly known as red goosefoot, is a flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae. It is native to the western United States and grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has alternate, lobed leaves that are often reddish in color, especially under stress conditions. Its small, green flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits called utricles. Chenopodium roseum is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued as a forage plant for livestock."
