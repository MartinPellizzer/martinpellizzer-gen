    "intro": "Cnicus arenarius, commonly known as sand thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed sites. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in arid conditions. Cnicus arenarius is also known for its ability to spread through seeds dispersed by wind and animals."
