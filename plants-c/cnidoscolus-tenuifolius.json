    "intro": "Cnidoscolus tenuifolius, commonly known as the arrowleaf monkey puzzle tree, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are divided into five to seven pointed lobes resembling an arrowhead. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by edible, starchy tubers that are used in local cuisines. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Due to its unique appearance and nutritional value, it is both ecologically and culturally significant in its native range."
