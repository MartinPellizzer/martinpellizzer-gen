It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Cayratia carnosa is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and climbing habit."
