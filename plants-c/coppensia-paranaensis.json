It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of grasses. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight reddish hue when young. Coppensia paranaensis thrives in wetland and marshy environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
