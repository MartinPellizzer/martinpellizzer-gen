    "intro": "Carissa opaca, commonly known as the yellow bell bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Carissa opaca is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
