    "intro": "Cuscuta europaea var. epilobii, commonly known as the European dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive appearance with thread-like, yellow stems that twine around its hosts. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found growing on crops like wheat and barley. Its life cycle involves germinating from seeds and establishing connections with host roots through specialized structures called haustoria. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
