    "intro": "Ceradenia albidula, commonly known as the white ceradenia, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in countries like Peru and Bolivia. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white or pale green flowers that bloom during the cooler months. Ceradenia albidula typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
