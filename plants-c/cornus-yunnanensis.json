    "intro": "Cornus yunnanensis, commonly known as Yunnan dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southwestern China. It belongs to the Cornaceae family and is characterized by its showy, white to pink bracts that appear in late spring. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Cornus yunnanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its seasonal color changes."
