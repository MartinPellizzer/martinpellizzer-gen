    "intro": "Carduncellus monspelliensium subsp. araneosus, commonly known as the spider-thorn or spider thistle, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its spines are a defense mechanism against herbivores, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. The subspecies is distinguished by its more robust growth and denser spines compared to other members of the genus."
