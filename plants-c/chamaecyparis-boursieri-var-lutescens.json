    "intro": "Chamaecyparis boursieri var. lutescens, commonly known as the golden cypress, is a rare and ornamental conifer native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts beautifully with its bluish-gray bark. The plant typically grows as a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are scale-like and densely packed, forming a compact, pyramidal shape. This variety is prized for its unique coloration and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
