    "intro": "Centropogon albertinus, commonly known as the Albertine grass. It is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Centropogon albertinus is often found in open grasslands and disturbed soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and supporting local biodiversity."
