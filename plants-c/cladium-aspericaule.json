    "intro": "Cladium aspericaule, commonly known as the rough-stemmed sawgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like foliage with rough, textured surfaces and sharp, saw-toothed edges along the leaf margins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by the development of dark, spherical berries. Cladium aspericaule thrives in shallow water or saturated soils, often forming dense stands in marshes and swamps. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial wildlife species."
