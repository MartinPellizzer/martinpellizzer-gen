    "intro": "Caragana crassispina, commonly known as the thick-leaved shrub or Siberian peashrub, is a deciduous shrub native to central and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and compound leaves that are usually pinnate with 10\u201320 leaflets. The plant produces yellow pea-like flowers in late spring, which are followed by small, flat pods containing several seeds. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system. Caragana crassispina is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
