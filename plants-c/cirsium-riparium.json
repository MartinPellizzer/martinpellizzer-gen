    "intro": "Cirsium riparium, commonly known as water thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It typically grows along riverbanks and marshy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features tall, spiny stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its purple to pink flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cirsium riparium plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
