    "intro": "Cyclosorus marquesicus, commonly known as the Marquesas waterwheel, is a rare aquatic fern native to the Marquesas Islands in French Polynesia. It is characterized by its unique, spiraling arrangement of leaves that form a compact, wheel-like structure. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as streams and pools, where it anchors itself to submerged rocks. Its fronds are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a dark green color and a smooth texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and human activity."
