    "intro": "Carex peregrina, commonly known as the wandering sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, erect stems and small, clustered spikelets. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant produces wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by water or animals. Carex peregrina is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
