    "intro": "Cordylanthus rigidus subsp. setiger, commonly known as the rigid curlcup, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush communities."
