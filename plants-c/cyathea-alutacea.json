It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnately compound fronds. The plant has a distinctive root system that forms a dense network, aiding in water absorption and soil stabilization. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental value. Cyathea alutacea is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments due to its preference for moist, well-drained soils."
