    "intro": "Cyclosorus stipellatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water clover, is a small aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that form a rosette shape, often floating on the water's surface. The plant has creeping rhizomes that help it spread along the substrate, and its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. It prefers still or slow-moving waters with ample sunlight and is often found in ponds and wetlands. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
