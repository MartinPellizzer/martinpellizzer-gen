    "intro": "Cormus florentina, commonly known as the noble corm, is a striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a corm, a modified stem that serves as a storage organ, allowing it to survive harsh winters. Its foliage consists of long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Cormus florentina is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
