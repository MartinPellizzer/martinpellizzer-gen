    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 houtteanum, commonly known as the yellow-lip cypripedium, is a hybrid orchid native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a yellow lip and a greenish-white upper sepal. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a decorative plant."
