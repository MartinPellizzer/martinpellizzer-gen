    "intro": "Conium maritimum, commonly known as poison hemlock, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white, umbrella-shaped clusters of flowers. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, particularly coniine, which can be fatal to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in wet meadows. Due to its toxicity, it is considered a noxious weed and requires careful handling."
