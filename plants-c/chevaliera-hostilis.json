    "intro": "Chevaliera hostilis, commonly known as the hostile chevaliera, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous tiny florets. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
