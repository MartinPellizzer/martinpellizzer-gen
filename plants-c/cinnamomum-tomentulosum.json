    "intro": "Cinnamomum tomentulosum, commonly known as the woolly cinnamon or Chinese cinnamon, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white pubescence covering its young leaves and branches, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by dark purple berries that contain the seeds. Its aromatic bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine and as a spice. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests."
