It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, warm environments and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular choice for vertical gardens and trellises."
