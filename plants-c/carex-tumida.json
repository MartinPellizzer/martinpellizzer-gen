    "intro": "Carex tumida, commonly known as the purple moor grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It is characterized by its dense, clumping growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of brownish flowers in late summer, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats. Carex tumida is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
