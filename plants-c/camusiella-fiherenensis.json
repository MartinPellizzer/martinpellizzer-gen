    "intro": "Camusiella fiherenensis, commonly known as the Fiheren's camusiella, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Camusiella fiherenensis is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
