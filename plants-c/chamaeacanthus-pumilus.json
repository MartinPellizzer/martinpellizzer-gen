    "intro": "Chamaeacanthus pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf spiny scale. It is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa, characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance. Chamaeacanthus pumilus is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
