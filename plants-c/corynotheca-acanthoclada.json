It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive hairy leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or rocky areas. Its leaves are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. The flowers, which are usually pink or purple, attract various pollinators including bees and butterflies."
