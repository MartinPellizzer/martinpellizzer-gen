    "intro": "Cyperus obtusiusculus, commonly known as the bluntleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are often clustered in spikes, and it produces small, three-angled berries. Cyperus obtusiusculus is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator species for wetland habitats."
