    "intro": "Carex lanceisquama, commonly known as the lance-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in three rows, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often subtended by bracts, a common feature in sedges. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along stream edges. Carex lanceisquama is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse ecosystems."
