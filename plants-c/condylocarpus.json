    "intro": "Condylocarpus, commonly known as the \"sea hake,\" is a genus of marine algae belonging to the red algae family, Rhodomelaceae. It is characterized by its branching, filamentous thallus that often forms dense mats on rocky substrates in intertidal zones. The plant's structure consists of a central axis with lateral branches, and its cells are typically elongated and cylindrical. Condylocarpus species are found in temperate and polar regions, often in shallow coastal waters. They play an important role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various organisms."
