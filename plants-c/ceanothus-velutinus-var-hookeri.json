    "intro": "Ceanothus velutinus var. hookeri, commonly known as Hooker's ceanothus, is a shrub native to the western United States, particularly California. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine, soft hairs, contributing to its velvety texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
