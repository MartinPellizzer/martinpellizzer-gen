    "intro": "Cordia heccaidecandra, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and timber, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
