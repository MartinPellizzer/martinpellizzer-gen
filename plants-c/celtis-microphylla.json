    "intro": "Celtis microphylla, commonly known as the littleleaf hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are usually less than 2 inches in length, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by small, round berries that are edible for some bird species. It has a compact, rounded shape with a smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. Celtis microphylla is valued for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in urban environments."
