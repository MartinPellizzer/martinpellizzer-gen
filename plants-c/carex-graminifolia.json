It is characterized by its grass-like foliage, with narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in three ranks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Carex graminifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
