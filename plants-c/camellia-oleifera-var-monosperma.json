    "intro": "Camellia oleifera var. monosperma, commonly known as the Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, orange-red fruits that contain one or two seeds each. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other regions for its hardiness and adaptability. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
