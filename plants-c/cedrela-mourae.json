    "intro": "Cedrela mourae, commonly known as Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its strength and aesthetic appeal. The plant has compound leaves with elongated leaflets and produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
