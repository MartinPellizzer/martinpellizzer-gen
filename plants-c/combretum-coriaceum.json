    "intro": "Combretum coriaceum, commonly known as the rough-leaved combretum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom, giving them a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. The species is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
