    "intro": "Cnemidaria decurrens, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features slender, rhizomatous stems that spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize moist soils effectively. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically green or pale in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy surface that aids in reducing water loss. Cnemidaria decurrens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
