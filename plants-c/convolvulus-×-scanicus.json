    "intro": "Convolvulus \u00d7 scanicus, commonly known as the hybrid bindweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, purple, or white. The plant is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in waste areas. It has a vigorous growth habit and can become invasive in certain regions due to its extensive root system and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though its aggressive nature requires careful management."
