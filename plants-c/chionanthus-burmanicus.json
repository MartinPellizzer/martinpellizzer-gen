It is characterized by its showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has opposite, simple, and ovate leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant in horticulture, though it is not widely cultivated outside its native range."
