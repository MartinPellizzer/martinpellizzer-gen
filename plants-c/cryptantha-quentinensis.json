It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Cryptantha quentinensis is often found in open grasslands and is a valuable component of local ecosystems."
