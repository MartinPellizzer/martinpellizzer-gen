    "intro": "Cactus incurvus, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. Cactus incurvus plays an important role in desert ecosystems by offering shelter and food to various wildlife species."
