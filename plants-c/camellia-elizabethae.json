    "intro": "Camellia elizabethae, commonly known as the Elizabetha camellia, is a rare and ornamental evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green elliptical leaves and produces showy, camellia-like flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and requires partial shade to full sun, making it suitable for garden cultivation in temperate climates. Camellia elizabethae is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often grown in botanical gardens and specialty plant collections. Its flowering period typically occurs in late winter to early spring, adding early color to the landscape."
