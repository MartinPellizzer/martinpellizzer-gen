    "intro": "Crocus orphanidis, commonly known as the orphan's crocus, is a rare and delicate perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its early blooming habit, often appearing in late winter or early spring. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, or orange, which are typically surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, dry environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
