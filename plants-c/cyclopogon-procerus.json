    "intro": "Cyclopogon procerus, commonly known as the slender cyclopogon, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to the wetlands and marshy areas of South America, particularly in countries like Brazil and Colombia. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and small, grass-like leaves. It produces panicles of tiny, white or pale green flowers, which bloom during the wet season. Cyclopogon procerus is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and lakes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
