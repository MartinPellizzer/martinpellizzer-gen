    "intro": "Ceratostema serrata, commonly known as the serrated ceratostema, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Sarcandraceae and is characterized by its distinctive, often hairy leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its foliage is usually serrated, giving it its common name, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not widely consumed. Ceratostema serrata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
