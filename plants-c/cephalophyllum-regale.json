    "intro": "Cephalophyllum regale, commonly known as the royal cephalophyllum, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, often in clusters at the top of its tall, sparsely branched stems. The plant has a unique growth habit, with its leaves arranged in a rosette pattern at the base, forming a dense, compact structure. Its botanical significance lies in its specialized adaptations to high-altitude environments, including thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cephalophyllum regale is considered a species of conservation concern."
