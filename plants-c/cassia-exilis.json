    "intro": "Cassia exilis, commonly known as slender cassia, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are delicate and feathery in appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing small, flat seeds. Cassia exilis is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
