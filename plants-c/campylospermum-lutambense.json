It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that allow it to access groundwater. Its bark contains compounds that have been used traditionally for their medicinal properties. Campylospermum lutambense plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife in its native range."
