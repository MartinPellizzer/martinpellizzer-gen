    "intro": "Cissus tenuipes, commonly known as the creeping grape ivy, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically light green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, berry-like fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its rapid growth and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for hanging baskets and vertical gardens."
