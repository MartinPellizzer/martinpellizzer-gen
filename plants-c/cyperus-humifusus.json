    "intro": "Cyperus humifusus, commonly known as the flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, showcasing its adaptability to moist environments. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. Cyperus humifusus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
