    "intro": "Chrysactinia lehtoae, commonly known as the Lehto's goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Chrysactinia lehtoae is often found growing in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun conditions."
