    "intro": "Castilleja latifolia subsp. carmelensis, commonly known as Carmel owl's clover, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of California. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces bright orange to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as coastal grasslands and dunes. Its subspecies status reflects its distinct ecological and morphological characteristics compared to other Castilleja species."
