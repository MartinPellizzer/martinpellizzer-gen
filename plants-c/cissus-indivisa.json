    "intro": "Cissus indivisa, commonly known as the boneless creeper, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically green with a slightly pubescent underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, fleshy fruits that are often eaten by birds and mammals. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular choice for trellises and hanging baskets."
