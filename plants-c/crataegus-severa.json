It is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. Crataegus severa typically grows in woodland edges, hedgerows, and rocky soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for wildlife, providing food and shelter for various species."
