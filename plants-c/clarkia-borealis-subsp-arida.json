It is characterized by its delicate, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and sandy soils. It has slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Clarkia borealis subsp. arida is adapted to arid environments, with mechanisms to conserve water and withstand extreme temperatures."
