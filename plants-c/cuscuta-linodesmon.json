    "intro": "Cuscuta linodesmon, commonly known as the yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow flowers and has a complex life cycle involving seed germination, attachment to a host, and eventual maturation. The plant's stems are covered in tiny, adhesive structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's tissues to extract water and nutrients. It is commonly found in various habitats, including agricultural fields and natural grasslands. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and native plant communities."
