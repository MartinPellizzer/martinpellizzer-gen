    "intro": "Calyptrogyne, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees that thrive in coastal and tropical environments. They are characterized by their showy, five-petaled flowers that often display vibrant colors such as red, yellow, or orange. The leaves are usually alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Calyptrogyne species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
