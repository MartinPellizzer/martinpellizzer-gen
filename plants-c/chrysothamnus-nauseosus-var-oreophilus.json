    "intro": "Chrysothamnus nauseosus var. oreophilus, commonly known as the Sierra goldthread, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at higher elevations, often in mountainous regions. Its foliage is covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is distinguished by its more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Chrysothamnus nauseosus."
