It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to the arid and coastal climate of its native habitat. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, white or pale blue flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
