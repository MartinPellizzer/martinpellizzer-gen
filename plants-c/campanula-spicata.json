    "intro": "Campanula spicata, commonly known as the spiked bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Campanula spicata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
