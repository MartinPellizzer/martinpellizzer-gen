    "intro": "Cereus estevesii, commonly known as the Estevess' cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Brazil. It is a columnar cactus with a tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, a characteristic feature of many cacti in the Cereus genus. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss in its harsh environment. The plant is adapted to store water in its thick, fleshy stems, allowing it to survive in low-rainfall conditions."
