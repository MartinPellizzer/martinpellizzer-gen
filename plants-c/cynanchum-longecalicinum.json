It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its fruits are follicles that release seeds with silky appendages. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its chemical composition, it has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
