    "intro": "Crassula campestris subsp. pharnaceoides, commonly known as the rock fig or stone plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of whitish wax. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its hardy nature, it is relatively low maintenance and suitable for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
