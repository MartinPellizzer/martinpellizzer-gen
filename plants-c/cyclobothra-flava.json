    "intro": "Cyclobothra flava, commonly known as the yellow cycad, is a species of cycad native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery, bright green leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the trunk, and the plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils. Cyclobothra flava is a slow-growing plant that can live for many decades, making it an important component of its native ecosystems."
