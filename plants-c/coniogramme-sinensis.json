    "intro": "Coniogramme sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese evergreen, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elongated and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, though it is more noted for its ornamental foliage than its blooms. It thrives in shady, humid environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant. Coniogramme sinensis is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
