    "intro": "Cousinia subcandicans, commonly known as the white-flowered cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and silver-gray, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Cousinia subcandicans is often cultivated in rock gardens and dry landscapes for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
