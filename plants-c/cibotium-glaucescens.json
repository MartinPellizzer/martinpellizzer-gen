    "intro": "Cibotium glaucescens, commonly known as the green tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive, fibrous trunk that is covered in a thin, scaly layer of dead fronds. Its rhizome is thick and produces new fronds from the base, contributing to its slow growth rate. Cibotium glaucescens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and is valued for its ornamental appearance."
