    "intro": "Cestrum dependens, commonly known as the hanging trumpetflower, is a species of flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, blooming in late winter to early spring. These flowers are pollinated primarily by moths and bats due to their nocturnal pollination strategy. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and showy blooms."
