    "intro": "Cenchrus marginalis, commonly known as the coastal panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. Cenchrus marginalis is often found in dunes and other coastal habitats, playing a role in stabilizing sandy environments."
