It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, often colorful leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are typically thick and have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Croton bergassae is also noted for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage."
