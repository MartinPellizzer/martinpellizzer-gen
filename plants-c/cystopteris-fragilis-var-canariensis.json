    "intro": "Cystopteris fragilis var. canariensis, commonly known as the Canary Islands brittle fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that are typically green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. This variety is noted for its fragility and is often considered a relict species with limited distribution."
