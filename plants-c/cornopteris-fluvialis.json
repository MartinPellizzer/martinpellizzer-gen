    "intro": "Cornopteris fluvialis, commonly known as the river fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the eastern United States. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as streams and rivers, where it attaches to rocks or submerged structures. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are typically submerged, with some fronds extending above the water surface. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, characteristic of the Dryopteridaceae family. Cornopteris fluvialis plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing riverbeds."
