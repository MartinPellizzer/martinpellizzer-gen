    "intro": "Centaurea rufipappa, commonly known as the redhead or redhead thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and striking, purple to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces bristly, feathery seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal, aiding in its propagation. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with serrated edges and covered in fine hairs. Centaurea rufipappa is often found in dry, open habitats such as roadsides and disturbed soils."
