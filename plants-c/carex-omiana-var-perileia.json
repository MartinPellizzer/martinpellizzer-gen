    "intro": "Carex omiana var. perileia, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to certain regions of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal in water gardens. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
