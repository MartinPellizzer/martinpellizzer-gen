    "intro": "Cogswellia howellii, commonly known as the Howell's cactus, is a rare and unique species native to the Sonoran Desert in the United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can grow up to 15 feet in height, often with a reddish or greenish hue. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its otherwise spiny appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure, making it a hardy choice for arid environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized desert gardens."
