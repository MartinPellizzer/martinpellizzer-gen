    "intro": "Cytisus leucanthus subsp. albus, commonly known as the white broom, is a flowering shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and pairs of opposite, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in dense clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal and sandy environments. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
