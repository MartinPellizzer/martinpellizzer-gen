It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like flower clusters. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
