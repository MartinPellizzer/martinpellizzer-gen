    "intro": "Cinnagrostis coarctata, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States. It features tall, erect stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish to reddish-purple flowers in late summer, which are arranged in panicle inflorescences. Its fibrous root system helps it thrive in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Cinnagrostis coarctata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
