    "intro": "Cuscuta tian-shanica, commonly known as the Tian Shan dodder, is a parasitic plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, attaching itself with specialized haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found growing on shrubs and grasses. Its life cycle is closely tied to the availability of suitable host species, making it an important component of certain ecosystems. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants."
