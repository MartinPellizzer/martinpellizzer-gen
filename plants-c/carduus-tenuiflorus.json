    "intro": "Carduus tenuiflorus, commonly known as slenderflower thistle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a robust taproot and tall, spiny stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a spherical cluster, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in fine hairs, and they have a distinctive, prickly texture. Carduus tenuiflorus is often found in dry meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun."
