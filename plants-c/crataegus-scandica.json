    "intro": "Crataegus scandica, commonly known as the climbing hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small vine native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the autumn, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are typically oval with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Crataegus scandica is often found in woodlands, hedgerows, and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
