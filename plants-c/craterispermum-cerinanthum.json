    "intro": "Craterispermum cerinanthum, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects in dry climates."
