    "intro": "Cynanchum dickinsii var. retropilum, commonly known as the backward-hairy milkweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
