    "intro": "Cynanchum collinum, commonly known as the hill milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its fruit is a slender, spindle-shaped follicle that contains several seeds. Cynanchum collinum is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability."
