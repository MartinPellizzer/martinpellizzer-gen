    "intro": "Claytonia lanceolata f. chrysantha, commonly known as the golden heart chickweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Portulacaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and thrives in partial to full sun. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
