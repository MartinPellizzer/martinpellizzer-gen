    "intro": "Cedrela monroensis, commonly known as the Cuban cedar, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and the Bahamas. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other valuable hardwoods. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a dense canopy of dark green leaves. Its flowers are small and yellowish-green, arranged in panicles, and it produces woody capsules that contain flat, winged seeds. The wood is highly prized for its durability and fine grain, though it is also threatened by deforestation and habitat loss."
