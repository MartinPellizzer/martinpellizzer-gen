It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as coastal areas and salt marshes. The plant has small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid conditions. Chamaeraphis depauperata plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
