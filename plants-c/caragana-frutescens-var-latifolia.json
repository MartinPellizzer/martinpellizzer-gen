    "intro": "Caragana frutescens var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf shrub willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features compound leaves with multiple leaflets, and its flowers are small, yellow, and borne in racemes. It produces woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
