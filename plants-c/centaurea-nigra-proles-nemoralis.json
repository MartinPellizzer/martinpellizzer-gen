It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its striking dark purple to black flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as woodlands, grasslands, and rocky areas. It produces small, spiny seed capsules that release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. The species is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a short-lived perennial."
