It is a low-growing annual or biennial plant with small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its delicate appearance, it is sometimes overlooked despite its ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
