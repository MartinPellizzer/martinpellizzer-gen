It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered spikelets. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are narrow and slightly twisted, giving it a distinctive appearance. The inflorescence consists of tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, which are adapted for dispersal in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
