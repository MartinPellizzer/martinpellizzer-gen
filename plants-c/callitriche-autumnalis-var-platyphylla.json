    "intro": "Callitriche autumnalis var. platyphylla, commonly known as the broadleaf water-starwort, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and the edges of lakes. The plant has small, floating or submerged leaves that are broadly ovate to round in shape, and it produces tiny, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink. It is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats on the water surface. This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
