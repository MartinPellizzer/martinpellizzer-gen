It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, often forming dense stands. Its slender, grass-like stems are usually unbranched, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Cyperus patulus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various organisms."
