    "intro": "Cestrum confertum, commonly known as the night-blooming coffee plant, is a flowering shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that open at night. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but have a bitter taste. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Cestrum confertum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and nocturnal blooming habit."
