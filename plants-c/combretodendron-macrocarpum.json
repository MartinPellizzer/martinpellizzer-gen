    "intro": "Combretodendron macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-fruited combretodendron, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by distinctive, woody, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies."
