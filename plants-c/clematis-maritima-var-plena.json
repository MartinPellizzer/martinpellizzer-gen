It features showy, double flowers that are typically white or pale blue, with numerous stamens and a central cluster of pistils. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and thrives in well-drained soils, often growing in saline or coastal environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to climb structures, making it a popular garden plant. The variety 'plena' is distinguished by its fully double blooms, enhancing its visual impact compared to the typical single-flowered form."
