    "intro": "Clematis leptomera, commonly known as the slender clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its twining stems and ability to climb by means of its tendrils. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for gardeners looking to add ornamental value to trellises or walls. Its botanical appeal lies in its elegant foliage and subtle floral display."
