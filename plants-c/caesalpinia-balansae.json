    "intro": "Caesalpinia balansae, commonly known as the Balansae flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange floral bracts that resemble flames, which appear during the dry season. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and its flowers are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It produces elongated, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Caesalpinia balansae is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
