It is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and succulent, bladder-like structures on its stems. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its unique adaptations allow it to tolerate salt spray and strong winds. Cakile myagroides plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
