The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, spiny capsules containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
