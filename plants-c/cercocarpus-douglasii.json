    "intro": "Cercocarpus douglasii, commonly known as the cliff-rose, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces distinctive, woody fruits called\u575a\u679c (nuts) that are covered in a thick, leathery coating. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
