    "intro": "Capnoides, commonly known as the false hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plants are shrubs or small trees with simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy or glandular. Their flowers are typically showy, with five petals and a prominent, five-lobed calyx. The fruits are capsules that release seeds when mature, contributing to the plant's reproductive strategy."
