    "intro": "Cotoneaster distichus, commonly known as the two-leaved cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features compound leaves with two opposite leaflets, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, typically in late spring, followed by bright red berries that attract birds. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature. Cotoneaster distichus thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
