It is primarily cultivated for industrial purposes such as fiber production, seed oil, and nutritional supplements. The plant typically grows tall and slender, with broad leaves and can reach heights of up to 5 meters in optimal conditions. Its flowering period is relatively short, usually lasting around 8 to 10 weeks, depending on environmental factors.
