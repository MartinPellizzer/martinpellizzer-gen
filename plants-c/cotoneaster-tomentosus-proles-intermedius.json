    "intro": "Cotoneaster tomentosus proles intermedius, commonly known as the woolly cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and small, oval leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
