    "intro": "Carex depressa var. neyrautii, commonly known as the Neyrault's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of greenish flowers in the summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
