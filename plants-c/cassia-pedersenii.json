    "intro": "Cassia pedersenii, commonly known as the golden cassia, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated, bean-like pods that contain seeds covered in a silky, white coating. Cassia pedersenii thrives in warm, sunny climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments, adding to its visual appeal."
