    "intro": "Centaurea hollandica, commonly known as Dutch clover, is a flowering plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers with red centers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Centaurea hollandica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
