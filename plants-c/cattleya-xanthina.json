    "intro": "Cattleya xanthina, commonly known as the yellow cattleya, is a hybrid orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with intricate patterns and a strong, spicy fragrance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in its natural habitat. Cattleya xanthina is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
