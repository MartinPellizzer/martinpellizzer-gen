    "intro": "Carex communis, commonly known as common sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Native to moist environments such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, it thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
