    "intro": "Cinchona cava, commonly known as the pink quinine tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its ornamental, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, while its bark contains alkaloids, though it is not as widely used for medicinal quinine as other cinchona species. Cinchona cava is valued for its horticultural appeal and its role in traditional medicine."
