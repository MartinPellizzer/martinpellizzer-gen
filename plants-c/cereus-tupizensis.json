    "intro": "Cereus tupizensis, commonly known as the Tupi night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Cereus tupizensis is well adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and extreme temperature fluctuations."
