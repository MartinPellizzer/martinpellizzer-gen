    "intro": "Campanula commutata, commonly known as the slender bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. The plant's showy blooms attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological value."
