    "intro": "Campomanesia multiflora, commonly known as the Brazilian wax apple or carambole, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It produces small, round fruits that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, with a waxy coating that gives it its common name. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, clustered in panicles. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits. The fruit is used in traditional medicine and can be consumed fresh or processed into jams and beverages."
