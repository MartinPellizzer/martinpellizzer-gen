    "intro": "Courbonia prunicarpa, commonly known as the red mulberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that mature to a bright red color, which are edible and often consumed by birds and mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. The red mulberry is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
