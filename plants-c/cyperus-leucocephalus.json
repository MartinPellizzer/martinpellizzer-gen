    "intro": "Cyperus leucocephalus, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas in Africa, Asia, and Australia. It features tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with dense clusters of white, fluffy flowers at the top, giving it its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the base. It thrives in moist or aquatic environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Cyperus leucocephalus is also used in traditional medicine and as a decorative plant in water gardens."
