    "intro": "Combretum acutifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flame bush, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and have a pointed tip. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to red, depending on the species and environmental conditions. These flowers are followed by small, capsule-like fruits that release seeds when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats."
