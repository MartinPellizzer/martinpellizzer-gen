    "intro": "Centaurea rigida f. schizophylla, commonly known as the rigid centaury or rock centaury, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that are often branched and covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slightly rough texture, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual interest."
