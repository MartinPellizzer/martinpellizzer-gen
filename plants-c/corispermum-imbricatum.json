It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to moist, sandy soils in arid regions, it is often found in desert environments. The plant has a unique ability to store water in its leaves, which helps it survive in harsh conditions. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates."
