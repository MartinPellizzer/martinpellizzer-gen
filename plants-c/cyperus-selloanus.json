It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flower heads.

Cyperus selloanus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
