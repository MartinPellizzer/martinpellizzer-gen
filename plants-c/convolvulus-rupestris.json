    "intro": "Convolvulus rupestris, commonly known as the rock bindweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in crevices and on rocky outcrops, adapting well to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers with five petals, which are often clustered in umbels. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration. The roots are fibrous and can form extensive networks, allowing the plant to anchor itself securely in unstable substrates."
