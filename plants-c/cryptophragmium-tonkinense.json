    "intro": "Cryptophragmium tonkinense, commonly known as the Tonkin cryptophragmium, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a thick, woody stem and palmate leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can thrive without direct sunlight. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color, and it produces berries that are an important food source for certain bird species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cryptophragmium tonkinense is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
