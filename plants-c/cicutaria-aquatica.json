    "intro": "Cicutaria aquatica, commonly known as water hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. The plant has slender, branching stems that often grow close to the water's surface. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cicutaria aquatica plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small aquatic organisms."
