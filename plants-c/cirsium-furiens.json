    "intro": "Cirsium furiens, commonly known as the thistle weed, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and along roadsides. Its leaves are covered in stiff, prickly hairs, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The flowers bloom in late summer, producing seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across various habitats."
