    "intro": "Carex huanjiangensis, commonly known as the Huanjiang sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to China and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers, typical of the sedge family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
