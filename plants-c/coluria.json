    "intro": "Coluria, commonly known as bittercress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens and along roadsides. Coluria species are known for their edible leaves and seeds, though some varieties are considered invasive. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in various conditions make it a common weed in many regions."
