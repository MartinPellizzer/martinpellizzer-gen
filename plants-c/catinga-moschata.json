    "intro": "Catinga moschata, commonly known as the musk cucumber, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It produces elongated, pale green fruits that have a distinctive musky aroma. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and hairy stems, typical of many members of the Cucurbitaceae family. Its flowers are yellow with five petals and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is edible when mature, though it is less commonly cultivated compared to other cucurbits."
