    "intro": "Crocus vernus var. albus-major, commonly known as the white crocus, is a variant of the common crocus that features predominantly white flowers. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland areas and meadows. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped blooms in shades of white to pale yellow, typically appearing in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from a corm that serves as its storage organ. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its early blooming habit."
