    "intro": "Conospermum helichrysoides, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a species of shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, preferring sandy or gravelly soils and full sun exposure. It is well adapted to salty sea air and can tolerate coastal winds and salt spray. Conospermum helichrysoides is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
