    "intro": "Clitandra, commonly known as the \"butterfly tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its showy, often pink or white flowers that resemble butterflies, hence its common name. The genus includes several species, such as *Clitandra fruticosa*, which is native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. These plants typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with simple, opposite leaves and clustered inflorescences. Clitandra species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
