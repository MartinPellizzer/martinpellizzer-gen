    "intro": "Cistus heterophyllus var. asperifolius, commonly known as rough-leaved rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and gray-green, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pale pink, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Its aromatic foliage and resilience make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and coastal gardens."
