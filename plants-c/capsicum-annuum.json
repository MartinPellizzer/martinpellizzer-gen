    "intro": "Capsicum annuum, commonly known as bell pepper, is a flowering plant in the nightshade family. It is native to the Americas and is characterized by its fleshy, lobed fruits that can range in color from green to red, yellow, orange, and even purple. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has simple, alternate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are yellow with five petals and are pollinated by insects. The fruit develops from the flower and is harvested when mature, with the genetic diversity of Capsicum annuum contributing to the wide variety of pepper types cultivated worldwide."
