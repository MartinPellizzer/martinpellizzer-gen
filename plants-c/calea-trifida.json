    "intro": "Calea trifida, commonly known as the \"Mexican nightshade,\" is a flowering plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking white, star-shaped flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a short, hairy stem and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. Its flowers emit a sweet scent that becomes more intense as dusk approaches. Calea trifida is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
