    "intro": "Cyperus niger, commonly known as black flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets, and it thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes and swampy areas. Cyperus niger is often found in disturbed soils and can be an invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it adaptable to a variety of aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
