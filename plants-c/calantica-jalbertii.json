    "intro": "Calantica jalbertii, commonly known as the Jalbert's calantica, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a velvety texture, while its stems are slender and branching. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, Calantica jalbertii is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
