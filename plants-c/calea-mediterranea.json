    "intro": "Calea mediterranea, commonly known as the Mediterranean candleplant, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its striking, candle-like inflorescence composed of long, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of pink and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to Mediterranean climates. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, silky coating, which helps reduce water loss. Calea mediterranea is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
