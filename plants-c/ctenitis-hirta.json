It is native to coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and its distinctive, spiny, bracted inflorescences that resemble a crown of small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, contributing to its common name. Ctenitis hirta is often found in maritime climates and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds."
