It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant has deeply lobed, gray-green leaves covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands. Carduus alpestris plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
