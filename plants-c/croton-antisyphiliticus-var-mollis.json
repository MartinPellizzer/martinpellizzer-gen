It is characterized by its smooth, velvety leaves that range in color from deep green to reddish-brown. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in hue. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
