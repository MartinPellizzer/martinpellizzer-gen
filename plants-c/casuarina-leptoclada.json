    "intro": "Casuarina leptoclada, commonly known as the slender she-oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like foliage that resembles the structure of a pine tree. The plant produces small, cylindrical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing woody seeds. Casuarina leptoclada thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or sandy environments. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil stabilization and reforestation efforts."
