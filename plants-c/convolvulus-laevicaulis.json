    "intro": "Convolvulus laevicaulis, commonly known as the smooth morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual with trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are smooth and glossy. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, blooming primarily in the spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in arid and semi-arid regions. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
