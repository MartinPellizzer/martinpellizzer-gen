    "intro": "Crataegus glabra, commonly known as the smooth hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, thornless bark and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that ripen in the fall and are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Crataegus glabra is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and other disturbed soils, and it is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological benefits. Its botanical features make it a notable species in both horticulture and natural ecosystems."
