    "intro": "Carduus martrinii, commonly known as yellow cock's-comb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features a tall, branching stem covered in spiny leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with a distinctive, comb-like appearance, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
