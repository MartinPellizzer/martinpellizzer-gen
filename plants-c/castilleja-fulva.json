    "intro": "Castilleja fulva, commonly known as the yellow milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant found primarily in the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It relies on other plants for some of its nutrients, forming a symbiotic relationship with its host species. Castilleja fulva plays an important ecological role in its habitat by supporting pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
