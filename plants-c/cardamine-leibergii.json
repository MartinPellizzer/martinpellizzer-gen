It is characterized by its basal rosette of pinnately divided, serrated leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, white or greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typical of the mustard family. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, round pods containing several seeds."
