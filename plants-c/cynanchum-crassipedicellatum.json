    "intro": "Cynanchum crassipedicellatum, commonly known as the broad-cell milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that are often hairy and can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate in shape, and covered with fine pubescence. The species is known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds and is a defense mechanism against herbivores."
