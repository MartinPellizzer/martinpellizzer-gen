    "intro": "Chrysosplenium nivale, commonly known as snow spleenwort, is a low-growing evergreen plant belonging to the family Spleenworts (Aspleniaceae). It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white or grayish\u8338\u6bdb. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or woodland areas. Its fronds are typically dark green and remain lush throughout the year, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Chrysosplenium nivale is well-suited for rock gardens and shaded borders, where it can form a carpet-like ground cover."
