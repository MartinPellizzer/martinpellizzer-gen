    "intro": "Colpodium pusillum, commonly known as the small bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are simple and often submerged, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous. Colpodium pusillum is a carnivorous plant that relies on its bladders to obtain nutrients from captured prey."
