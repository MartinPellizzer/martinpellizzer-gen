    "intro": "Calebrachys peduncularis, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It possesses small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest aquatic insects, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor waters. The plant has thin, branching stems that float just below the water surface, with tiny leaves that aid in photosynthesis. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish-white in color, and appear in clusters. Calebrachys peduncularis plays a unique ecological role by supplementing its nutrient intake through predation, making it an important species in its habitat."
