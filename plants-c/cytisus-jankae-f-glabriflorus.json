    "intro": "Cytisus jankae f. glabriflorus, commonly known as the smooth-flowered broom, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, shrub-like growth habit and produces bright yellow, pea-like flowers. The leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. This particular form of Cytisus jankae is distinguished by its glabrous (smooth) flower petals, which set it apart from other variants. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
