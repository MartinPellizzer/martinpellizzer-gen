    "intro": "Curima, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and compound leaves. The tree produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, seed-like structures. Curima is valued for its dense, aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and carving. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
