    "intro": "Cyrtomium caudatum, commonly known as the hairy holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green with a slight hairy texture on the underside. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing leaves. Cyrtomium caudatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
