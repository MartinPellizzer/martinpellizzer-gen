    "intro": "Critoniopsis cerulosa, commonly known as the bluebells of the Andes, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Critoniopsis cerulosa is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment."
