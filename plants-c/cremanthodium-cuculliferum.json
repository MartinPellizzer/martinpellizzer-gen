    "intro": "Cremanthodium cuculliferum, commonly known as the hooded everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada and other mountainous regions of California. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and woolly, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters at the tips of its slender stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
