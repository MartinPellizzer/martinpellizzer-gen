    "intro": "Calamagrostis epigejos var. fusca, commonly known as the dusky reed, is a perennial grass native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and damp woodlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its foliage is often a deep green, and it can form dense stands in suitable conditions. It is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
