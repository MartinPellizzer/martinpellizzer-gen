    "intro": "Cercouratea impressa, commonly known as the impressed fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds with a distinctive, impressed midrib. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in sori that are arranged along the margins of the fronds. Cercouratea impressa is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of understory vegetation."
