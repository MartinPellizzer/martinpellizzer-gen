    "intro": "Cephalotaxus drupacea var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf Chinese yew, is a compact evergreen shrub native to China. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are arranged in dense clusters along the stems. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments. Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is often used in rock gardens and as a foundation plant in landscaping."
