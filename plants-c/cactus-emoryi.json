    "intro": "Cactus emoryi, commonly known as Emory's cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments. The plant has a globular shape with a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing in late spring or early summer. The plant is well adapted to harsh desert climates and plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
