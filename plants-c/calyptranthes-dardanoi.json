It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are oval-shaped and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native high-altitude environment. Calyptranthes dardanoi is often found in cloud forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
