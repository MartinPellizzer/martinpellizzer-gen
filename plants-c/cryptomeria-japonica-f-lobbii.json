    "intro": "Cryptomeria japonica f. lobbii, commonly known as the Japanese cedar variety 'Lobbii', is a unique form of the Japanese cedar characterized by its distinct foliage and growth habits. This cultivar is notable for its narrow, needle-like leaves that are shorter and more densely packed compared to the typical Japanese cedar. It exhibits a slow growth rate, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces or as a decorative specimen plant. The plant is evergreen, retaining its foliage year-round, and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Its ornamental appeal lies in its compact form and the subtle color variations in its foliage."
