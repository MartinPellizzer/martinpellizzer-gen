    "intro": "Ctenopteris vomaensis, commonly known as the Vomaensia water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, finger-like segments. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as rivers and ponds, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently. The fronds are often used in ornamental aquatic gardens due to their aesthetic appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
