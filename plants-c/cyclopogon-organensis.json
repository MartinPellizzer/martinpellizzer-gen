    "intro": "Cyclopogon organensis, commonly known as the Organ Island grass, is a flowering plant native to the island of Organ in the Gal\u00e1pagos archipelago. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers, typical of many grass species. It thrives in coastal and lowland habitats, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
