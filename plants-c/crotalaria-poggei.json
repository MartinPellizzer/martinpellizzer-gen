    "intro": "Crotalaria poggei, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous annual that grows up to 30 cm in height, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth texture. The plant produces clusters of yellow, spurred flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its seeds are encased in a hard, leathery pod that splits open when mature. Crotalaria poggei is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial in certain agricultural contexts."
