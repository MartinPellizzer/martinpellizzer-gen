    "intro": "Centaurea jacea var. microptilon, commonly known as the lesser centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and bright blue or purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. This variety is distinguished by its smaller, more compact flowers compared to the typical Centaurea jacea."
