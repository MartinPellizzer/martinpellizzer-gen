    "intro": "Cassiope myosuroides, commonly known as the pink mountain heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and covered in a fine, white wax. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salt exposure. Cassiope myosuroides is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
