    "intro": "Cocos drudei, commonly known as the Drude's coconut, is a rare and ancient species of palm native to the coastal regions of southern China and the Korean Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender trunk and long, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear yellowish-white flowers, which eventually develop into hard, fibrous fruits. Unlike the more familiar coconut palms, Cocos drudei has a shorter lifespan and is less commonly cultivated for its economic value. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for researchers studying plant evolution and conservation."
