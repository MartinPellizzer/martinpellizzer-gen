    "intro": "Celtis tenuifolia var. georgiana, commonly known as the Georgia hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Elm family (Ulmaceae) and is characterized by its small, oval leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits that are typically eaten by birds and small mammals. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland areas. The bark is smooth and grayish-white, becoming fissured with age."
