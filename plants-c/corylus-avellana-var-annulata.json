    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. annulata, commonly known as the European hazel with annular markings, is a variant of the hazelnut tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its unique, ringed or annular patterns on the nuts, which distinguish it from other hazel varieties. The plant produces small, deciduous leaves that are alternate and ovate in shape. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial shade to full sun. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its edible nuts."
