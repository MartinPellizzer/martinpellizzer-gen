    "intro": "Cousinia gnaphalodes, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a perennial herb with a compact, cushion-like growth form, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically silver-gray, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Cousinia gnaphalodes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
