    "intro": "Ctenopteris forsythiana, commonly known as the yellow sea holly, is a species of fern native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into narrow, feather-like segments. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found growing near the shoreline or in shaded, moist areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Ctenopteris forsythiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
