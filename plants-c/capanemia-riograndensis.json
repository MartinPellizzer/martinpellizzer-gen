    "intro": "Capanemia riograndensis, commonly known as the Rio Grande caper, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Capparaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and succulent leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. It has a compact growth habit and produces small, edible fruits that are sometimes used in local cuisines. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
