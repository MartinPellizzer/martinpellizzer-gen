It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy, pink to purple flower heads. The plant is typically found in open habitats such as sandy soils and rocky outcrops, where it thrives in full sun. Its small, wind-dispersed seeds allow it to colonize disturbed areas effectively. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
