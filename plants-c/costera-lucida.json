    "intro": "Costera lucida, commonly known as the whiteflower morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces showy white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the morning. Its scientific name reflects its bright, luminous flowers, which open early in the day. Costera lucida is often found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and roadsides."
