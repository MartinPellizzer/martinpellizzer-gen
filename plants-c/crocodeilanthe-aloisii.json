    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe aloisii, commonly known as the dragon's blood fern, is a rare epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces spores in small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of its fronds. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species in botanical collections."
