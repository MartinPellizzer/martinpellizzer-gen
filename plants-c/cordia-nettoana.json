    "intro": "Cordia nettoana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Brazil. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. Cordia nettoana is valued for its hard, dark wood, which is used in musical instruments and furniture, though its conservation status is of concern due to overharvesting."
