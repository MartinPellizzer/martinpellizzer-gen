    "intro": "Coryanthes gomezii, commonly known as the Gomez's hooded orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, hood-shaped flowers that are often brightly colored. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in cloud forests where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, such as beetles, which are attracted by the scent and structure of the blooms. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Coryanthes gomezii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
