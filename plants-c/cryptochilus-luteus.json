    "intro": "Cryptochilus luteus, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Cryptochilus luteus is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its role in local ecosystems."
