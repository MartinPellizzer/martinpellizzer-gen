    "intro": "Cinnamomum reticulatum, commonly known as the reticulated cinnamon or wild cinnamon, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown bark that exudes a strong cinnamon scent when cut. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by elliptical, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed berry that turns red when mature. The essential oils extracted from its bark and leaves are widely used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent."
