    "intro": "Crassula lycopodioides var. obtusifolia, commonly known as the Cape Hottentot. This plant is a succulent species native to South Africa, characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and fleshy, thick leaves. The leaves are typically rounded and have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
