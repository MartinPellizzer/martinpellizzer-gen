    "intro": "Cabralea eichleriana var. macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered cabralea, is a species native to the tropical Andes of South America. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that contain seeds dispersed by animals. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
