    "intro": "Canistrum montanum, commonly known as mountain canistrum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cactaceae. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its water-storing stems. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss. Canistrum montanum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
