    "intro": "Cynorkis fimbriata, commonly known as the fringe-flowered orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that feature a distinctive fringed lip, which is a key botanical trait. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, often found on tree trunks or rocks in humid environments. Its leaves are usually long and strap-like, arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
