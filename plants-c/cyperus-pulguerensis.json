It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, clustered flowers. Cyperus pulguerensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
