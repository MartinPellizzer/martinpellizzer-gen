    "intro": "Coriflora integrifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf coralplant, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and have smooth margins, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. This plant is also valued for its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion in sandy environments."
