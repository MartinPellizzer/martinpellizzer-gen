    "intro": "Cranichis pastoensis, commonly known as the Pasto orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to South America, particularly Colombia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or high-altitude grasslands. Its growth habit is rhizomatous, with a short stem and a single, erect inflorescence bearing several flowers. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
