    "intro": "Cypripedium assamicum, commonly known as the Assam yellow lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow pouch-shaped lip, which is a key feature in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats at high altitudes. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single, showy flower each year. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
