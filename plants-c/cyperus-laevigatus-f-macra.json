    "intro": "Cyperus laevigatus f. macra, commonly known as the broad-leaf flatsedge, is a variant of the flatsedge genus native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered spikes of flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils, making it a common inhabitant of marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Its botanical features include a rhizomatous root system and stolons that help it spread vegetatively. The inflorescence consists of pale green to brown spikelets, which are often wind-pollinated."
