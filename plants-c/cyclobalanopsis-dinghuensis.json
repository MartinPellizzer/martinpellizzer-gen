It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly resistant to decay. The plant typically grows in subtropical forests and is known for its evergreen foliage and distinctive cupule structures that enclose its acorns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation priority."
