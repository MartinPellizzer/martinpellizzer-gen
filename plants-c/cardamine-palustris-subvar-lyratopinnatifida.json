    "intro": "Cardamine palustris subvar. lyratopinnatifida, commonly known as the lyrated water cress, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in shallow water. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in nutrient-rich, moist soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. This subspecies is notable for its unique leaf morphology and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
