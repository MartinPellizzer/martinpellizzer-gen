    "intro": "Convolvulus corymbosus, commonly known as the common morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, opening in the morning. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
