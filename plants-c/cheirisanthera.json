    "intro": "Cheirisanthera, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Cheirisanthera is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
