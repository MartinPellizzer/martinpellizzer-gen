    "intro": "Cuscuta godronii, commonly known as the Godron's dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure composed of thread-like stems that wrap around host plants. The plant is native to North America and is often found growing on shrubs and trees. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants."
