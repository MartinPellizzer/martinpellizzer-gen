    "intro": "Cypripedium cathayenum, commonly known as the Chinese lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature of the Cypripedium genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often at high altitudes. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single, waxy flower with a deep pink or reddish hue. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
