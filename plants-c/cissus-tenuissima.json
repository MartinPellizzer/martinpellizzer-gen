    "intro": "Cissus tenuissima, commonly known as the creeping oxalis, is a tropical climbing plant native to regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially in response to light exposure. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
