    "intro": "Critoniopsis woytkowskii, commonly known as the Woytkowski's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage consists of narrow, strap-like leaves that help it conserve moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
