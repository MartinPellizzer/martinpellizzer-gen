It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking violet to purple flowers with a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, and its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. The species is notable for its nocturnal blooming habit, attracting specific pollinators such as moths."
