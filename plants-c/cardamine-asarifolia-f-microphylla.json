    "intro": "Cardamine asarifolia f. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved water crowfoot, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating on the surface of freshwater habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five sepals and numerous stamens, typical of the genus Cardamine. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows. Its delicate structure and preference for aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions make it an important component of freshwater ecosystems."
