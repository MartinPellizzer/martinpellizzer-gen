    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 toezensis, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a member of the Carex genus in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and pond edges. The plant features dense clusters of grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in wetland areas. Due to its adaptability, Carex \u00d7 toezensis is often used in ecological restoration projects."
