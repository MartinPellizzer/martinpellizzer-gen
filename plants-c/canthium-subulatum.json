    "intro": "Canthium subulatum, commonly known as the slender spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a herbaceous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring narrow, spiny leaves and yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance, aiding in seed dispersal. Its botanical characteristics include a robust root system and the ability to thrive in disturbed soils. Canthium subulatum is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline environments."
