    "intro": "Catasetum proboscideum, commonly known as the elephant's trunk orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender petals that resemble an elephant's trunk, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers with a unique, elongated spur that houses the pollinia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Catasetum proboscideum is known for its specialized pollination mechanism, which involves the transfer of pollinia via a pollinator's body."
