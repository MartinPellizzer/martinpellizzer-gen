    "intro": "Chamaeiris foetida, commonly known as the stinking jew's ear, is a rare and elusive plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is a small, perennial herb with distinctive, fleshy, ear-shaped leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces small, pale green or yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered. Its unique appearance and rare occurrence make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
