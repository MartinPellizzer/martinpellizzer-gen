    "intro": "Calluna atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of the British Isles and northern Europe. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late summer. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and moorland habitats. Its leaves are narrow, dark green, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Calluna atlantica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife, particularly insects and birds."
