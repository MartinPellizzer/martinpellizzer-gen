    "intro": "Carex striata var. japonica, commonly known as Japanese sedge, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is a perennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for wetland gardens. Its ability to thrive in wet conditions makes it an effective plant for erosion control and water filtration in natural habitats."
