    "intro": "Crataegus mercerensis, commonly known as Mercer's hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 feet and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pinkish flowers in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are a food source for various birds and small mammals. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. Crataegus mercerensis is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, thriving in moist, well-drained soils."
