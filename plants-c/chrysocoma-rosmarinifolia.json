    "intro": "Chrysocoma rosmarinifolia, commonly known as the African rosemary, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves that resemble those of rosemary, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
