    "intro": "Cyathobasis, commonly known as the spurge or euphorbia, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique inflorescence called a cyathium, which resembles a cup and contains specialized flowers. Many species of Cyathobasis are succulent, storing water in their thick, fleshy stems and leaves. They are often found in arid or semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Some species are toxic, containing milky sap that can cause skin irritation or more severe reactions."
