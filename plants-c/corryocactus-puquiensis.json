It is a solitary cactus with a short, thick stem that often branches into multiple cylindrical stems. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss. This species is well adapted to extreme desert conditions, showcasing remarkable resilience to drought and high temperatures."
