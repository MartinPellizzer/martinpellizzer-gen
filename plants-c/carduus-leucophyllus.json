    "intro": "Carduus leucophyllus, commonly known as the whiteleaf thistle, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silver-gray, woolly foliage and striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and has a robust, upright stem. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The whiteleaf thistle is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
