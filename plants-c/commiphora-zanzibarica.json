    "intro": "Commiphora zanzibarica, commonly known as olibanum, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces a fragrant resin, which has been historically used in incense and traditional medicine. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as an endangered species."
