    "intro": "Cynodon grandispiculus, commonly known as the large-headed couchgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common species in grassland ecosystems. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in erosion control and as a forage crop."
