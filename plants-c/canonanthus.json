These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and the plants often form dense clumps. Canonanthus species are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and as cut flowers. They prefer well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
