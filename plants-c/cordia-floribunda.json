    "intro": "Cordia floribunda, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its showy, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in dense clusters, often covering the entire plant during the flowering season. The leaves are simple, alternate, and elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a glossy appearance. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to warm, humid climates."
