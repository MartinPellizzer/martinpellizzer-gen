    "intro": "Cousinia pseudostenolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Cousinia pseudostenolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
