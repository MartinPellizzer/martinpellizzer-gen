    "intro": "Comarostaphylis conzattii, commonly known as the Conzatti's ghostflower, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is notable for its unique morphology, including its short, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sunlight, often growing in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
