It features compound leaves with 5 to 9 elliptical leaflets that are often pubescent beneath. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in terminal clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that mature in late summer. Its botanical characteristics include a woody stem with smooth bark and a tendency to form dense thickets. Cupania multiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
