    "intro": "Carex viridistellata, commonly known as green-veined sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its foliage is usually a deep green with prominent midrib veins, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Carex viridistellata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
