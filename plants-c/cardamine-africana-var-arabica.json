    "intro": "Cardamine africana var. arabica, commonly known as the Arabian watercress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to aquatic environments, allowing it to thrive in moist or submerged soils. This variety is native to parts of Africa and the Middle East, where it is often found in freshwater habitats."
