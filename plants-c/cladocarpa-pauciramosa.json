    "intro": "Cladocarpa pauciramosa, commonly known as the sparse-branched sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant typically grows in humid lowland areas and has small, elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement. Its flowers are yellowish-green and clustered in panicles, followed by small, woody fruits that contain aromatic seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
