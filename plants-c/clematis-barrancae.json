    "intro": "Clematis barrancae, commonly known as the Sierra Madre clematis, is a rare and flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and showy, typically blue or violet flowers. The plant features compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, temperate climate to flourish. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected natural reserves."
