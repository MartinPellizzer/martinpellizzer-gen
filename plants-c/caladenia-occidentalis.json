    "intro": "Caladenia occidentalis, commonly known as the Western Spider-orchid, is an endemic orchid species native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, strikingly colored flower that typically displays a mix of red, orange, and yellow hues. The plant produces a single, narrow, spurred labellum, which is a distinctive feature of the orchid family. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as shrublands and heathlands. Caladenia occidentalis is a protected species due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss."
