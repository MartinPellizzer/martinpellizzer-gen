It features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, typically ranging from dark green to purple in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a loose cluster, which bloom in early spring. Its flowers are followed by heart-shaped, greenish-white seed pods that mature in late summer. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
