    "intro": "Cephalanthera ensifolia, commonly known as the sword-leaved lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to eastern North America. It features a slender, erect stem that bears a dense cluster of pale green to brownish flowers arranged in a loose spiral. The plant has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the base. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Cephalanthera ensifolia is known for its lack of showy petals and its reliance on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake."
