    "intro": "Carex macrochlamys, commonly known as the broad-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often subtended by leaf-like bracts. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Carex macrochlamys is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
