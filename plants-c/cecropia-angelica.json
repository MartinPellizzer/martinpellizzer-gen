    "intro": "Cecropia angelica, commonly known as the angel's cecropia, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that develop into elongated, woody fruits. Its growth habit is typically tree-like, with a single trunk and broad, spreading branches. Cecropia angelica is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests."
