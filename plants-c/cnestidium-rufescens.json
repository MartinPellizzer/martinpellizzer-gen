    "intro": "Cnestidium rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base of its stems. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, followed by berries that are typically red or orange in color. Its roots form haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. Cnestidium rufescens plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects."
