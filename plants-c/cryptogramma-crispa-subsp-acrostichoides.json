    "intro": "Cryptogramma crispa subsp. acrostichoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cryptogramma, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices, where it can form dense, mat-like growths. Its unique leaf morphology and habitat preferences make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native range."
