    "intro": "Carex welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitsch sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, making it a valuable ground cover in wetland habitats. Carex welwitschii is also noted for its ecological importance, providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
