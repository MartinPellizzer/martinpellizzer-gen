    "intro": "Carex canescens var. maxima, commonly known as the large-flowered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of pale green to silver-gray leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
