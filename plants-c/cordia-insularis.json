    "intro": "Cordia insularis, commonly known as the island cordia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, yellowish flowers followed by fleshy, red berries. The berries are an important food source for various birds and mammals. Its ecological significance lies in its role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
