    "intro": "Cassia urophyllidia, commonly known as the golden flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and birds. The leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments, giving the plant a delicate appearance. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain flat, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to warm, humid climates."
