    "intro": "Coryphantha sneedii, commonly known as the Sneed's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in spiny areoles, typical of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Coryphantha sneedii is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to desert conditions."
