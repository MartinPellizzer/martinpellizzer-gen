    "intro": "Calyptranthes depressa, commonly known as the low calyptranthes, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy, dark green appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, round, yellowish fruits. Calyptranthes depressa thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. It is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats, where it contributes to the local biodiversity."
