    "intro": "Convolvulus \u00d7 platigena, commonly known as the hybrid blue morning glory, is a flowering plant in the bindweed family (Convolvulaceae). It is a cross between Convolvulus tricolor and Convolvulus arvensis, resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The species is notable for its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in the early morning. It has heart-shaped leaves and twining stems that allow it to climb and spread rapidly. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is considered invasive in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit."
