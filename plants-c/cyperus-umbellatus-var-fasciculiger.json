    "intro": "Cyperus umbellatus var. fasciculiger, commonly known as the clustered umbrella sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters, with narrow, grass-like leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are typically arranged in an umbel-like structure, giving it its common name. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, wetlands, and along water bodies. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
