    "intro": "Cerastium campanulatum var. granulatum, commonly known as the granulate mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in a fine, granular texture, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale blue, blooming in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover."
