    "intro": "Calathea sciuroides, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage with patterns resembling prayer hands, hence its common name. The leaves are typically dark green with contrasting white or silver veins, and they fold shut at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Calathea sciuroides is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
