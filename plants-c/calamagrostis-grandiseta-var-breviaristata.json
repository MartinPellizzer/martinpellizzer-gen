It features fine, silver-blue foliage that becomes more pronounced in the fall, making it a striking ornamental plant. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate floral display. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for wetland or pond edge plantings. Its compact growth habit and attractive coloration make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
