    "intro": "Cupressus cornuta, commonly known as the Sierra redwood, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that are arranged in crossed pairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and fibrous, providing protection against wildfires. Cupressus cornuta is often found in mountainous regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cooler climates."
