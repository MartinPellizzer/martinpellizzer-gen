    "intro": "Caladenia deformis var. alba, commonly known as the White Spider Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Western Australia. It features a slender, hairy stem with a single, pale white or cream-colored flower that resembles a spider in appearance. The plant produces a single, showy labellum that is often adorned with intricate markings. It thrives in sandy soils and is typically found in open woodlands or heathlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
