    "intro": "Claytonia perfoliata var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spring beauty, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features rosettes of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which bloom above the foliage. Its leaves are often fused at the base, creating a distinctive \"perfoliate\" appearance, where the stem passes through the leaf blade. This variety is adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, thriving in cool, moist environments."
