    "intro": "Cuscuta deltoidea var. serrulata, commonly known as the serrated dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow or green flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to North America and is often found on a variety of herbaceous plants. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to spread across different habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left unchecked."
