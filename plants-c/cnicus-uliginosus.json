    "intro": "Cnicus uliginosus, commonly known as the bog thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and Asia. It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, covered with soft, grayish-green leaves that are often woolly in texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, arranged in a composite head with both ray and disk florets. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Cnicus uliginosus is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of lakes and rivers."
