    "intro": "Cheilanthes yunnanensis var. dilatata, commonly known as the Yunnan rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to China. It is a small, terrestrial fern that thrives in rocky, arid environments, often growing on limestone or sandstone substrates. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth form with closely spaced, leathery fronds that are dark green and slightly curled. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters, and it is adapted to survive in low-nutrient, drought-prone conditions. This variety is notable for its resilience and is often found in mountainous regions of Yunnan Province."
