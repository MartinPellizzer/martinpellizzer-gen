It is characterized by its long, pendulous racemes of bright yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets and produces pod-like fruits that contain flat, winged seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to provide shade. The species is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
