    "intro": "Carex specifica f. brevifructus, commonly known as the short-fruited sedge, is a variant of the Carex genus, characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive inflorescence structure. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Europe, typically found in moist, acidic soils such as those in bogs or wet meadows. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated, a common reproductive strategy among sedges. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its wetland habitat. The fruiting structures are short and clustered, giving it the specific epithet \"brevifructus,\" meaning \"short fruit.\""
