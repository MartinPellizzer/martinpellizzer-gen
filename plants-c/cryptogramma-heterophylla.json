    "intro": "Cryptogramma heterophylla, commonly known as the variable cryptogramma, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Cryptogramma heterophylla thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky outcrops. Its variability in leaf shape and size contributes to its common name and makes it a distinctive member of the Polypodiaceae family."
