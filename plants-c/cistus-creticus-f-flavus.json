    "intro": "Cistus creticus f. flavus, commonly known as the Cretan rock rose, is a flowering shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or coastal environments. Its flowers are known for their honey-scented aroma, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
