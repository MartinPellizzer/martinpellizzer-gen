    "intro": "Cicuta cellulosa, commonly known as water hemlock, is a highly toxic member of the Apiaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its smooth, hollow stems and fern-like, compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its roots contain potent toxins, including cicutoxin, which can be lethal to humans and animals. Due to its toxicity, it is often considered one of the most dangerous plants in North America."
