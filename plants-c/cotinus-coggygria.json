    "intro": "Cotinus coggygria, commonly known as the smoke bush, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, pink or red flowers that resemble smoke, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, red or orange berries that are edible for birds but generally not for humans. Its foliage turns vibrant shades of red and purple in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens. Cotinus coggygria thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for landscaping."
