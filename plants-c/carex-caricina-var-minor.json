It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This variety typically thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and swamps, and is often found in coastal areas. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce tiny flowers that are wind-pollinated. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
