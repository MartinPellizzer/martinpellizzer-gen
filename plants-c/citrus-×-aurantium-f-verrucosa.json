    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 aurantium f. verrucosa, commonly known as the rough lemon, is a citrus plant characterized by its thick, bumpy, and often pebbled rind. It is a hybrid species within the genus Citrus, originating from a cross between the mandarin orange and the pomelo. The plant is typically shrub-like, with broad, ovate leaves and fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit is small, sour, and not commonly consumed as food but is valued for its high vitamin C content and use in traditional medicine. The rough lemon is also widely cultivated as a rootstock for other citrus plants due to its hardiness and disease resistance."
