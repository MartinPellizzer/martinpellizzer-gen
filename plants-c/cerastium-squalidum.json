    "intro": "Cerastium squalidum, commonly known as the squalid chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers and hairy, often reddish stems. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Cerastium squalidum is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
