    "intro": "Coelogyne exaltata, commonly known as the tall orchid or the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that often display a combination of yellow and green hues. The plant typically blooms in summer, producing fragrant, lance-shaped flowers that are highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts. Coelogyne exaltata is a sympodial orchid, meaning it grows in segments, with each growth cycle producing new pseudobulbs. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
