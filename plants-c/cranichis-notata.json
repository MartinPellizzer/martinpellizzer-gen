    "intro": "Cranichis notata, commonly known as the pink fairy\u5170, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. The plant has a distinctive appearance with pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, conservation efforts are critical for its survival."
