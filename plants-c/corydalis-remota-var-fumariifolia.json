    "intro": "Corydalis remota var. fumariifolia, commonly known as the smoke-flowered corydalis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, nodding flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep violet, often with a distinctive smoky or blurred appearance. The plant produces small, elongated seed pods that split open to release its tiny seeds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its unique botanical appearance. Corydalis remota var. fumariifolia thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers partial to full shade in its natural habitat."
