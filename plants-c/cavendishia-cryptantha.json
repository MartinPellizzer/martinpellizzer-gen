    "intro": "Cavendishia cryptantha, commonly known as the hidden beauty orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically blooms during the cooler months, showcasing intricate floral structures with a unique, almost hidden appearance. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Cavendishia cryptantha is considered a delicately endangered species."
