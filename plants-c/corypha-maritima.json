    "intro": "Corypha maritima, commonly known as the sea date palm, is a tropical plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible fruits resembling dates, though they are not typically consumed by humans. Corypha maritima thrives in sandy, saline soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and coastal winds. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
