    "intro": "Corylus heterophylla var. yezoensis, commonly known as the Yezo hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its distinctive two-leaved morphology, with juvenile leaves being palmately lobed and adult leaves being simple and oval. The plant produces small, yellowish male flowers and female flowers in catkins, which are typically found on separate plants. Its nuts are enclosed in a hairy husk and are edible after the husk is removed. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
