    "intro": "Campylocentrum embreei, commonly known as the Embree's star cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its ability to produce vibrant, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant features dense, spiny areoles that support both spines and branching hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stem. Campylocentrum embreei is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun."
