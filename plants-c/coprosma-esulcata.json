It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and lowland areas, characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a rough, textured surface that gives the plant its common name. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by red or orange berries that are an important food source for native birds. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological significance in its native habitat."
