    "intro": "Cyrtandra trichocalyx, commonly known as the Hawaiian cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, or red. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is often found growing on rocky or volcanic slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in Hawaii."
