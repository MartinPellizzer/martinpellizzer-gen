    "intro": "Coleobotrys heterantha, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to dry climates, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, sandy soils. Coleobotrys heterantha is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
