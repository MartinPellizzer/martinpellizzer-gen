    "intro": "Cynoctonum purpureum, commonly known as the purple nightshade, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant produces showy purple flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its berries are toxic and should not be consumed by humans or animals. The plant has been used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to its potent chemical composition."
