It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its small, white or pale pink flowers bloom in late spring, and it produces hairy, segmented pods that contain several seeds.
