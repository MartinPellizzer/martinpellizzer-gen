    "intro": "Chelidonium minus, commonly known as lesser celandine, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features bright yellow, buttercup-like flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread rapidly and form dense mats. Its leaves are broadly oval with a waxy surface, and it is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit."
