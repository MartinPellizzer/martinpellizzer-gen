    "intro": "Cypella rosei, commonly known as the rose-centred cypella, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and requires well-drained conditions to thrive. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cypella rosei is considered a vulnerable species."
