    "intro": "Canthium burttii subsp. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth canthium, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its glabrous (smooth) stems and leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
