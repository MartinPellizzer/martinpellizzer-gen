    "intro": "Coffea porophylla, commonly known as the Porophylla coffee plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the highlands of Ethiopia and is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red berries that contain the seeds used for coffee production, though it is less commonly cultivated than other coffee species. It thrives in cool, humid climates with well-drained soil and requires specific conditions for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
