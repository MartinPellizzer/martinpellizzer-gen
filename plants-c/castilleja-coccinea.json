    "intro": "Castilleja coccinea, commonly known as the scarlet milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has specialized roots that attach to the roots of other plants, drawing nutrients from them. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Castilleja coccinea plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar to pollinators like bees and butterflies."
