It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, three-winged fruits. Cecropia coriacea is often found in moist lowland forests and is known for its rapid growth rate. It plays an important role in the ecosystem as a host plant for various insects and birds."
