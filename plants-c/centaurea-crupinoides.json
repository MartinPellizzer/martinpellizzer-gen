    "intro": "Centaurea crupinoides, commonly known as the creeping cornflower, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with a distinctive purple or reddish central disk, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow, slightly hairy, and arranged alternately along the stems. Centaurea crupinoides is adapted to dry, disturbed soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
