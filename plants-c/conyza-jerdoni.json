    "intro": "Conyza jerdoni, commonly known as the Indian ironweed, is a flowering plant native to India and parts of Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. The plant features opposite, hairy leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a composite head. Its fruit is a small achene with a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Conyza jerdoni is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
