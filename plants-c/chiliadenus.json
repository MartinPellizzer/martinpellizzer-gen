    "intro": "Chiliadenus, commonly known as the \"flowering nightshade,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Solanaceae family. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, often brightly colored flowers. The flowers are usually bisexual, with five fused petals that form a funnel shape, and they are often visited by nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Chiliadenus species are native to various regions in South America, particularly in the Andes, where they thrive in temperate to subtropical climates. Some species are cultivated for their ornamental value, while others have been studied for their potential medicinal properties."
