    "intro": "Calceolaria microbefaria, commonly known as the dwarf slipper orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple. The plant is relatively small, with compact growth habits and hairy stems, which help it survive in its high-altitude environment. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, tubular flowers that bloom in the spring. Calceolaria microbefaria is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is appreciated for its delicate appearance."
