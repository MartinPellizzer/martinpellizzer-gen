It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant features yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, with finely divided, fern-like leaves. Castra is characterized by its strong, aromatic scent and has been historically used in herbal remedies. Its botanical name, *Tanacetum vulgare*, reflects its association with the tansy plant family."
