    "intro": "Corispermum stenolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved corisperm, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Chenopodiaceae. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of greenish-white flowers. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and is adapted to thrive in saline and dry environments. Its seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution in harsh habitats. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological adaptations and potential for use in phytoremediation."
