    "intro": "Carex forsteri var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically reaches heights of less than 10 centimeters, forming dense, mat-like colonies that thrive in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are usually a bluish-green color, and it is often found in wetland or riparian habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wet environments."
