    "intro": "Carex rugosperma, commonly known as the rough-fruited sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Australia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically rough to the touch, giving it its common name, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Carex rugosperma is often found in wetlands, swampy areas, and along the edges of water bodies."
