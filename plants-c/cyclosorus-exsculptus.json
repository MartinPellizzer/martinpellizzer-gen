    "intro": "Cyclosorus exsculptus, commonly known as the sculptured water fern, is a rare aquatic fern found in specific freshwater habitats. It has delicate, finely divided fronds that are often submerged, with a distinctive, sculpted appearance on the undersides. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still water with rich organic substrates, often in shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
