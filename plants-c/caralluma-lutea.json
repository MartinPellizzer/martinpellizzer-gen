    "intro": "Caralluma lutea, commonly known as the yellow devil or desert nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments by storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves and stems. It produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically orange or yellow in color. Caralluma lutea is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though its toxic properties require caution."
