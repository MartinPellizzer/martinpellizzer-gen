    "intro": "Centaurea candollei, commonly known as the Candolle's knapweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands. Its blue to purple flowers bloom in summer, and the plant has bristly, lance-shaped leaves. Centaurea candollei is often found in disturbed areas and can thrive in poor soils due to its hardy nature."
