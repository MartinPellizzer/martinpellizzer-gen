    "intro": "Cardamine palustris var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate marsh cress, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist to aquatic environments such as marshes, stream banks, and pond edges. The plant has alternate, trifoliate leaves with a basal rosette structure, and its flowers are small, white, and clustered in terminal racemes. It produces elongated, slender capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds. This variety is often distinguished from other Cardamine species by its intermediate morphological traits and habitat preferences."
