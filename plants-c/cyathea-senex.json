    "intro": "Cyathea senex, commonly known as the old man's fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant exhibits a unique growth pattern, with a slow-growing trunk that develops a rough, fibrous exterior over time. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental value. Cyathea senex plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
