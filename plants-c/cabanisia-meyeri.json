    "intro": "Cabanisia meyeri, commonly known as the Meyer's cabanisia, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, a common feature in the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
