    "intro": "Coffea umbellata, commonly known as the umbellate coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and clusters of small white flowers. Its fruits are red berries that contain the seeds used for coffee production. However, it is less commonly cultivated compared to other coffee species due to its lower yield and specific growing requirements."
