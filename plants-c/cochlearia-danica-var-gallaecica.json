It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky coastal habitats, thriving in saline and well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
