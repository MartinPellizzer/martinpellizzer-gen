    "intro": "Carex nodaeana, commonly known as the clustered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the sedge family. Carex nodaeana thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
