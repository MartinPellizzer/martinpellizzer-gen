    "intro": "Cocos rupestris, commonly known as the rock coconut or stone coconut, is a unique species of palm native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by round, fibrous fruits that contain a single seed. Due to its adaptation to rocky and arid environments, it exhibits specialized root systems and water-conserving mechanisms. However, it is considered rare and is often found in protected natural habitats."
