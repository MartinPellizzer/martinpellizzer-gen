    "intro": "Coronilla pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean crownvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula and parts of southern France. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its creeping growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
