    "intro": "Calea scabra var. palustris, commonly known as the swamp calea, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences composed of numerous small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in a dense, rounded cluster. The plant typically grows in moist or aquatic environments, often in marshes or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and the stems are often erect and somewhat fibrous. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique floral display."
