    "intro": "Conoclinium hirsutissimum, commonly known as the hummingbird vine, is a perennial climbing plant native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange with a prominent yellow throat, designed to attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves with a distinctive hairy texture, contributing to its common name. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, moist soil. Its rapid growth habit makes it an effective ground cover or vertical accent in gardens."
