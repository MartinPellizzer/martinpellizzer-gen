    "intro": "Corytholoma, commonly known as the horned lichen, is a type of foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, flattened thallus with a central, horn-like structure called a corymbe. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga, and a fungal component, typically an ascomycete. Corytholoma is often found on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate and boreal regions. Its slow growth and unique morphology make it an important indicator species for environmental conditions."
