It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, clustered flowers and glandular hairs that give it a sticky appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The flowers, which are usually pale blue or purple, bloom in early spring and are followed by small, rounded pods that contain the seeds."
