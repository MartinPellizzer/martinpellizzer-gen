    "intro": "Chrysanthemum incanum, commonly known as the silverleaf chrysanthemum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its hairy leaves and compact growth habit contribute to its drought tolerance. Chrysanthemum incanum is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
