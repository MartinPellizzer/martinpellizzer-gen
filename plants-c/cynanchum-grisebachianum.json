    "intro": "Cynanchum grisebachianum, commonly known as the graystem milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its erect stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its fruits are follicles containing toxic latex. It is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils, and it has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. However, due to its toxic compounds, it should be handled with care."
