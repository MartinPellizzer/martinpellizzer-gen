    "intro": "Carpentia, commonly known as the desert cushion, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family. These succulent plants are native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. They are characterized by their dense, spiny foliage and showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant's thick leaves store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Carpentia species are often used in xeriscaping due to their low water requirements and ornamental value."
