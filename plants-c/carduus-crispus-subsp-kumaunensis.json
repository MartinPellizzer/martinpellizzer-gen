    "intro": "Carduus crispus subsp. kumaunensis, commonly known as Kumaun thistle, is a perennial herb native to the Himalayan regions of India. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high altitudes. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine."
