    "intro": "Cerastium angustifolium, commonly known as narrowleaf mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, opposite, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. The flowers are white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems, and bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is often used in ornamental gardening due to its compact form and delicate flowers."
