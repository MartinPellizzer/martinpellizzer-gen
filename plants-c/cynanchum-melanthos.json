    "intro": "Cynanchum melanthos, commonly known as purple milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy purple or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance in its native range."
