    "intro": "Cyathea cicatricosa, commonly known as the scarred tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds. The plant grows in humid, shaded environments, typically in forest understories. Its fronds are bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in attracting pollinators at night. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various organisms."
