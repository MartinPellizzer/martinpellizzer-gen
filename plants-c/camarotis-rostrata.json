    "intro": "Camarotis rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated leaf roller, is a species of moth in the family Tortricidae. It is native to various regions in Africa, including South Africa, where it is often found in grassland and shrubland habitats. The plant is characterized by its distinctive rostrum, a projecting structure on the head, which is a key identifying feature. It plays a role in local ecosystems as both a host plant for its larvae and a component of the vegetation structure. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and specialized species."
