    "intro": "Cirsium verum, commonly known as common thistle, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. Native to Europe, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including North America. The plant typically grows in dry meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its prickly foliage serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
