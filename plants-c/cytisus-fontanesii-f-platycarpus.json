    "intro": "Cytisus fontanesii f. platycarpus, commonly known as the flatpod broom, is a compact shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a vibrant touch to its foliage. The leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. Its distinguishing characteristic is the flattened, pod-like fruit, which sets it apart from other cytisus species. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
