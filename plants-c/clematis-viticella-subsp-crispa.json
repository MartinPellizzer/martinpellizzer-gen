    "intro": "Clematis viticella subsp. crispa, commonly known as the curly clematis, is a vigorous climbing vine native to Europe. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale blue flowers. The plant produces a distinctive, curled appearance in its foliage, which gives it its common name. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is well-suited for trellises or fences. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, ornamental vine."
