    "intro": "Carum decumbens, commonly known as creeping caraway, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically features slender, aromatic stems that lie close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small white or pale yellow flowers in umbels, which are followed by oval, aromatic seeds. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a strong, caraway-like scent. Carum decumbens is often found in rocky or dry habitats and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties."
