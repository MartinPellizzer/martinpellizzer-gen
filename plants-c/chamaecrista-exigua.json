It is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its seeds are encased in small, woody pods that split open to release the seeds. Chamaecrista exigua is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some traditional medicinal practices."
