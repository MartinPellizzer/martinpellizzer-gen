    "intro": "Ctenitis dentata, commonly known as the toothed ctenitis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are deeply divided and have a serrated or toothed margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Ctenitis dentata is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, nutrient-rich soils."
