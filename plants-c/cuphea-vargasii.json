    "intro": "Cuphea vargasii, commonly known as the Mexican flame flower, is a tropical shrub native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red bracts that resemble flames, which are not petals but modified leaves. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in warm, sunny climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cuphea vargasii is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
