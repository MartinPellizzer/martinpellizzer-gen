    "intro": "Cousinia tianschanica, commonly known as the Tian Shan cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to harsh, high-altitude conditions. It has slender stems and produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse its seeds. Cousinia tianschanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid and semi-arid regions."
