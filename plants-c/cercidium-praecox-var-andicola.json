    "intro": "Cercidium praecox var. andicola, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its globular, spiny stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are typically small, linear, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. This species is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
