    "intro": "Cereus fendleri, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cactus native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a single night before wilting. Cereus fendleri is well adapted to hot, dry conditions and requires minimal water once established."
