    "intro": "Cussonia kirkii var. bracteata, commonly known as the bracteated cussonia, is a striking tropical plant native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant in tropical regions."
