    "intro": "Callitris fothergillii, commonly known as the coastal or coastal cypress, is a small evergreen conifer native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, feather-like leaves and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its slow growth rate and distinctive appearance make it a valuable plant for coastal landscaping and ecological restoration."
