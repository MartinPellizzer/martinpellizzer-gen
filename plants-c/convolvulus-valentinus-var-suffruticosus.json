    "intro": "Convolvulus valentinus var. suffruticosus, commonly known as Valentine's convolvulus, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a sprawling, herbaceous perennial that produces clusters of small, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant has hairy, ascending stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early spring blooming habit and its ability to attract pollinators."
