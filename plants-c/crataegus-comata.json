    "intro": "Crataegus comata, commonly known as the silvery hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or open areas. Crataegus comata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and other wildlife."
