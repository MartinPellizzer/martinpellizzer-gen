    "intro": "Calceolaria nahuelbutae, commonly known as the Andean hooded orchid, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its unique, hood-like flowers that resemble small cups. The plant typically grows in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Calceolaria nahuelbutae is considered a rare and endangered species."
