    "intro": "Coryphantha roberti, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in spines and often have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Coryphantha roberti is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and reducing water loss through its waxy surface."
