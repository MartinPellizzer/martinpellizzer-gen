    "intro": "Castanea japonica var. canescens, commonly known as the Japanese chestnut with silver hair, is a variant of the Japanese chestnut native to eastern Asia. This plant is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray bark and its distinctive, elongated, spiny fruits. The leaves are typically alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its edible nuts, which are smaller than those of the common chestnut."
