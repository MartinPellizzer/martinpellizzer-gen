    "intro": "Cyclodiscus latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf cyclodiscus, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, where it thrives in humid, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its large, broad leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or red. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking appearance and ability to attract pollinators. Cyclodiscus latifolius prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
