    "intro": "Cummingia tenella, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It features small, pale green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in loose, sandy soils. Cummingia tenella is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and minimal maintenance requirements."
