    "intro": "Carex pachyandra, commonly known as the broad-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to North America and is typically found in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in dense, grass-like clusters. Its flowering stems produce small, clustered spikes of pale to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Carex pachyandra is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
