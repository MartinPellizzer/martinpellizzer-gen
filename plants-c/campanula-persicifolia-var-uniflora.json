    "intro": "Campanula persicifolia var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a compact, upright growth habit with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with silver. The plant produces a single, showy blue or violet bell-shaped flower at the tip of each stem, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and long flowering period."
