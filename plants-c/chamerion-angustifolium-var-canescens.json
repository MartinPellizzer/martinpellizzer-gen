It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers in clusters at the tips of its stems, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in tundra, meadows, and along roadsides. This species is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
