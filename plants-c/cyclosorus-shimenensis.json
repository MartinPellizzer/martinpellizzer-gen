    "intro": "Cyclosorus shimenensis, commonly known as the Shimen water fern, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving streams and ponds with muddy bottoms. Its reproductive structures include tiny, submerged flowers that produce both male and female gametes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cyclosorus shimenensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
