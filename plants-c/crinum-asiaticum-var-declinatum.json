    "intro": "Crinum asiaticum var. declinatum, commonly known as the Asian crinum or the fragrant lily, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its tall, strap-like leaves and large, showy flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces white or pinkish flowers with a strong, sweet fragrance, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. The bulbs are toxic, so caution is advised when handling the plant."
