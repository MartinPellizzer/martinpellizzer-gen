    "intro": "Castilleja jiquilpana, commonly known as the Jiquilpan milkvetch, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on its host plants for water and nutrients, forming a symbiotic relationship. It typically grows in open habitats such as pine-oak forests and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
