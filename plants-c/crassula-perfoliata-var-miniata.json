It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and fleshy, bluish-green leaves with red or pink markings. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its vibrant coloration. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and rockeries."
