    "intro": "Calonema caesareum subsp. maritimum, commonly known as the coastal calonema, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid and saline environments, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its slow growth and drought tolerance make it an attractive choice for low-maintenance gardening."
