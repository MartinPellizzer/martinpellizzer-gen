    "intro": "Cistus dichotomus, commonly known as the two-branched rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub characterized by its aromatic, evergreen leaves and showy, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. Cistus dichotomus is also valued for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
