    "intro": "Centaurea nervosa f. kojicii, commonly known as the Kojic's slender centaury, is a rare and distinctive plant species within the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils. This subspecies is native to southern Europe and is noted for its ornamental value in gardens. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered plant."
