It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant has palmate leaves with a waxy surface and produces small, clustered yellow flowers in late summer. It thrives in moist, sandy soils along coastal areas and is often found in dune environments. This species is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it an important component of coastal vegetation."
