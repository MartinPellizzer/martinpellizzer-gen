    "intro": "Chaetaria depressa, commonly known as the flathead hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths close to the ground, with slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to colonize disturbed or marginal habitats. Its foliage is often covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. Chaetaria depressa is well adapted to moist, acidic soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks."
