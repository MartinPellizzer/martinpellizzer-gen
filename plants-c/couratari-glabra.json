    "intro": "Couratari glabra, commonly known as the smooth couratari, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glabrous surface. Couratari glabra produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing a single seed. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its hard, durable wood used in construction and furniture-making."
