    "intro": "Cheirinia nivalis var. radicata, commonly known as the snowdrop, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, nodding flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland floors or rocky crevices. The flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with three petals and three sepals, and are adapted to attract early pollinators."
