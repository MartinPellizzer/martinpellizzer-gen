It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, pond edges, and wet meadows. Its leaves are usually hairy, especially along the margins, giving it a distinctive texture. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, clustered in spikelets that develop into three-sided, capsule-like fruits."
