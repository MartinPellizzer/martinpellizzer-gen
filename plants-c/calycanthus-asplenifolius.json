    "intro": "Calycanthus asplenifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf sweetshrub, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually dark green and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its botanical name reflects its leaf shape (\"asplenifolius\" meaning resembling fern leaves) and its sweet, spicy scent. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
