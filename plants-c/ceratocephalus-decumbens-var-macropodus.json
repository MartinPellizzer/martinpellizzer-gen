    "intro": "Ceratocephalus decumbens var. macropodus, commonly known as the broadleaf sandbur, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, spiny burrs that contain seeds. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. It blooms with yellow flowers in the spring, and its seed burs are adapted for dispersal by attachment to animals or clothing. The species is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth and persistent seed production."
