    "intro": "Clematis angustifolia var. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected narrowleaf clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features slender, twining stems that can reach lengths of up to 15 feet, making it suitable for trellises or fences. The plant produces delicate, lace-like foliage with finely divided leaves that create a feathery appearance. Its flowers are small, white, and fragrant, appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, requiring regular pruning to maintain its shape and encourage blooming."
