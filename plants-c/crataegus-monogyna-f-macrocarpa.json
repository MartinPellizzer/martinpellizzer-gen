It is characterized by its notably larger berries compared to the typical species, which are usually red or orange when mature. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically found in woodland edges and hedgerows across Europe. Its flowers are white or pink, appearing in clusters, and it produces a fragrant, edible fruit. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and insects."
