    "intro": "Cuscuta europaea var. epilotum, commonly known as the European dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant is characterized by its smooth, hairless appearance and is often found growing on a variety of herbaceous plants. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is considered a weed in agricultural settings. Its life cycle involves producing seeds that can remain viable in the soil for many years."
