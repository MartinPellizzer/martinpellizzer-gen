    "intro": "Comarostaphylis minor, commonly known as the small sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Comarostaphylis minor is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
