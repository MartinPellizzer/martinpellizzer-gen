    "intro": "Chrysothamnus laetevirens, commonly known as the yellow rabbitbrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellow-green foliage and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
