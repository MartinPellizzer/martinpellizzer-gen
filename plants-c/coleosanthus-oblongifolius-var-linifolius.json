It features dense clusters of narrow, linear leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical fruit capsules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to humid, tropical climates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
