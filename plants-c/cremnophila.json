    "intro": "Cremnophila, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family. It is characterized by its unique, often pendulous flowers that are typically green or greenish-yellow in color. These plants are adapted to grow in rocky or crevice environments, showcasing their ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Cremnophila species are found primarily in the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. Their botanical features include a lack of true leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through the green, fleshy stems."
