    "intro": "Carex pedunculata, commonly known as the slender marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Carex pedunculata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
