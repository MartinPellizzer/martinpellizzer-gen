    "intro": "Cnicus lappoides, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, and it has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread vegetatively. Its yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and the plant is often used in ornamental gardening due to its bright color and resilience. However, it can also become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
