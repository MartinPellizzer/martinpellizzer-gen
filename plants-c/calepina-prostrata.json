    "intro": "Calepina prostrata, commonly known as\u530d\u5310\u8f66\u524d\u8349, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features a prostrate habit with creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its ability to retain moisture. Calepina prostrata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
