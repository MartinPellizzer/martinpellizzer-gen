    "intro": "Croton macrobothrys var. microbotrys, commonly known as the dwarf croton, is a compact shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features striking, palmately lobed leaves that are typically bright green with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, spiny capsules containing seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
