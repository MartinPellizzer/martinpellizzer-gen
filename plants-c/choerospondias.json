    "intro": "Choerospondias, commonly known as the Indian chestnut or wild chestnut, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Anacardiaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Choerospondias axillaris, which is native to South and Southeast Asia. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically odd-pinnate, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The fruit is a woody drupe, often containing a single seed, and it is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The genus is valued for its ecological role and has been studied for its potential in sustainable forestry and conservation efforts."
