    "intro": "Cnicus simplex, commonly known as the lesser prickly lettuce, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and thrives in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for several years, contributing to its persistence in various habitats. The plant is often found in temperate regions and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
