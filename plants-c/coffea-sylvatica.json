It is native to tropical regions of Africa, including countries like Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves and produces small, white flowers that give way to red berries containing the seeds used for coffee. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its ornamental value and potential for cultivation, it is sometimes grown in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
