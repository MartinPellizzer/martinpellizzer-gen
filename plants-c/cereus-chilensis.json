    "intro": "Cereus chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean night-blooming cereus, is a cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems and spiny, ribbed structure. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night. These flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few hours. Cereus chilensis is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
