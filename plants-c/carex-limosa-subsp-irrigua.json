    "intro": "Carex limosa subsp. irrigua, commonly known as the swamp sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and narrow, with a dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne on slender, branching inflorescences. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
