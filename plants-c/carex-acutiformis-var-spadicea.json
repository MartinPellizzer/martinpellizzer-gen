    "intro": "Carex acutiformis var. spadicea, commonly known as the Spadiceous Carex, is a perennial sedge native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spadix-like inflorescences that are usually yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting wetland biodiversity."
