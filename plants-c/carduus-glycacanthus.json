    "intro": "Carduus glycacanthus, commonly known as the bitter thistle, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in dry, rocky habitats. The plant features spiny leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. It is known for its bitter taste, which is due to the presence of sesquiterpene lactones. Its ecological role includes providing food for certain insects and serving as a host plant for some Lepidoptera species."
