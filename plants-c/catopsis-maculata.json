    "intro": "Catopsis maculata, commonly known as the spotted catopsis, is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It is a small, evergreen perennial plant characterized by its compact growth habit and rosette-forming leaves. The leaves are typically narrow, sword-shaped, and often have a distinctive spotted or mottled appearance, which gives the plant its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually borne in clusters at the base of the plant. Catopsis maculata is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
