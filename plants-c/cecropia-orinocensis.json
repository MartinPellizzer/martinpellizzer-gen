    "intro": "Cecropia orinocensis, commonly known as the Orinoco cecropia, is a fast-growing tree native to South America, particularly found in the Orinoco River basin. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and distinctive, hollow stems. The plant is often associated with epiphytic growth, where it attaches to other plants without parasitizing them. Its rapid growth rate makes it useful in reforestation efforts and as a source of timber. The species also supports a variety of wildlife, including insects and birds, due to its abundant foliage and nectar-rich flowers."
