    "intro": "Cyperus atractocarpus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sedges, is a flowering plant belonging to the sedge family (Cyperaceae). It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are usually clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes. Cyperus atractocarpus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
