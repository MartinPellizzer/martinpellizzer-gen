    "intro": "Campanula arvatica subsp. arvatica, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
