    "intro": "Cnicus cerberus, commonly known as the devil's-bit scabious, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark, hairy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Cnicus cerberus is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
