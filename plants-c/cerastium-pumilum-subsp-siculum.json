    "intro": "Cerastium pumilum subsp. siculum, commonly known as Sicilian mouse-ear, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
