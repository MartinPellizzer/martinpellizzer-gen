It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant characterized by its rounded, broad leaves. The leaves are typically glaucous, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are followed by hard, triangular seeds."
