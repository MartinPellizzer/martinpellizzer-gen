    "intro": "Clerodendrum putre, commonly known as the stinking clerodendrum, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom throughout the warm season. Its fruit is a globose, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant is noted for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is particularly noticeable when the flowers are in bloom."
