    "intro": "Cycas rumphii f. palauica, commonly known as the Palau cycad, is a unique variant of the cycad genus native to the Pacific island of Palau. This plant is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. It produces cones rather than flowers, with the male cones developing at the base of the plant and the female cones emerging from the trunk. The plant is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat-specific requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
