    "intro": "Cyperus carrii, commonly known as the spiked flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes, ponds, and along the edges of water bodies. Its slender, grass-like stems are often clustered, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes. Cyperus carrii is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its ability to thrive in moist conditions."
