    "intro": "Colysis minutula, commonly known as the small bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. It has delicate, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. Colysis minutula is a carnivorous plant that supplements its nutrient intake by digesting trapped prey."
