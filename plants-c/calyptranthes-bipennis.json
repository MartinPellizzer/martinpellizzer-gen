    "intro": "Calyptranthes bipennis, commonly known as the two-winged calyptranthes, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly the island of Hispaniola. It belongs to the family Theaceae, which includes camellias and other ornamental shrubs. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
