    "intro": "Cadelari lappacea, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic regions and subarctic areas. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pale blue or purple in color. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in cold climates. Cadelari lappacea plays an important role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for herbivores."
