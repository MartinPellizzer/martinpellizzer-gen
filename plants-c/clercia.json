    "intro": "Clercia, commonly known as the bluebell or wild bluebell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polemoniaceae. These plants are native to the western United States and parts of Mexico, where they thrive in moist, shaded environments. Clercia species typically produce showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stems. Clercia plants are often found in woodlands and along stream banks, contributing to the biodiversity of their native habitats."
