    "intro": "Ctenopteris excaudata, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its fronds are bioluminescent, a unique feature that aids in attracting pollinators. The reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation."
