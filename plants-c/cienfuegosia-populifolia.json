    "intro": "Cienfuegosia populifolia, commonly known as the Cuban poplar, is a small tree native to Cuba. It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and smooth, gray bark. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. It produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by winged seeds that aid in wind dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
