    "intro": "Cissus duarteana var. sessilifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian stonecrop, is a climbing vine native to South America. It features heart-shaped, thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its stems are succulent and can store water, making it drought-tolerant. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental foliage and ability to climb structures."
