    "intro": "Cynometra spruceana var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, dark bark and large, elliptical leaves that are often leathery in texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland evergreen forests. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically valued for construction and traditional uses."
