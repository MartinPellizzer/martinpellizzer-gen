    "intro": "Canistrum camacaense, commonly known as the Camacan cactus, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant features succulent, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its small, white or pale green flowers bloom during the dry season, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. The plant's unique morphology and adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study in xerophytic ecosystems."
