    "intro": "Corrigiola latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes, rocky outcrops, and dry grasslands. The plant features small, fleshy, alternate leaves that are broad and often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are white or pink, arranged in clusters, and bloom in early summer. Corrigiola latifolia is adapted to harsh environments, with its succulent leaves helping to retain moisture in arid conditions."
