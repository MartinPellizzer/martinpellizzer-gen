    "intro": "Chlorospatha chocoensis, commonly known as the Chocoan green fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the tropical rainforests of western Colombia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive green coloration. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on rocky outcrops or in the understory of dense vegetation. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves, a common feature in ferns. Due to habitat loss, Chlorospatha chocoensis is considered vulnerable and is of significant interest to botanists studying tropical flora."
