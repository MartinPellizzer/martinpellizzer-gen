    "intro": "Cynosurus effusus var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender hairy sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a compact appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, three-sided flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native habitats."
