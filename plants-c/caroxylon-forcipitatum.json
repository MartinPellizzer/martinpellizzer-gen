    "intro": "Caroxylon forcipitatum, commonly known as the sword fern, is a perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its tall, arching fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, sword-like shape, which gives it its common name. Caroxylon forcipitatum is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
