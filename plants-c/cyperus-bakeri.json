    "intro": "Cyperus bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's flatsedge, is a flowering plant in the sedge family, Cyperaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that are typically pale green or brown. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Cyperus bakeri is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive appearance and adaptability to moist conditions."
