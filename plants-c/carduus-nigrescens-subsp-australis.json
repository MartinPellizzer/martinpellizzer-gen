    "intro": "Carduus nigrescens subsp. australis, commonly known as the Australian thistle, is a perennial herb native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its spiny, hairy leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. It has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in arid conditions. Due to its invasive nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
