    "intro": "Crinum \u00d7 amabile, commonly known as the fragrant crinum, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Crinum asiaticum and Crinum bulbisimum. It is a herbaceous perennial with striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant features strap-like, narrow leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its pleasant fragrance, which is especially noticeable in the evening."
