It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, savannas, and woodland edges. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to seasonal rainfall patterns and can tolerate a range of soil conditions. This grass is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
