    "intro": "Columnea herthae, commonly known as the Herth's flame flower, is a tropical perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular, red-orange flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. The plant has opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves with a glossy green surface and serrated edges. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Columnea herthae is often cultivated for its ornamental value in both greenhouse and indoor settings."
