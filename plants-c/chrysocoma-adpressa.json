    "intro": "Chrysocoma adpressa, commonly known as the dwarf chrysocoma, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover. Chrysocoma adpressa is drought-tolerant and prefers well-drained soils."
