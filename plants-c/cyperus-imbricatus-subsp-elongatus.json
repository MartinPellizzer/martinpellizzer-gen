    "intro": "Cyperus imbricatus subsp. elongatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf paperplant, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marshy areas. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to submerged soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation in aquatic environments."
