    "intro": "Cattleya angereri, commonly known as the Angerer's Cattleya, is a species of orchid native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in the humid, shaded environments of its natural habitat. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil. Cattleya angereri is prized by orchid growers for its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
