    "intro": "Casearia silvana, commonly known as the Brazilian beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small to medium-sized shrub that typically grows up to 3 meters in height. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually green with a slightly pubescent surface. It produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers followed by bright purple berries that are highly ornamental. The berries are edible for some bird species but are generally not consumed by humans due to their tart flavor."
