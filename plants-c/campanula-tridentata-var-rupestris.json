    "intro": "Campanula tridentata var. rupestris, commonly known as the rock bellflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with hairy, gray-green leaves that are adapted to rocky and arid environments. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its resilience to drought and cold makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and garden design in harsh climates."
