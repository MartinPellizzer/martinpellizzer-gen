    "intro": "Cedrela febrifuga var. pealii, commonly known as the Peal's yellow cedar, is a tropical tree native to Central America. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and long, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, elongated fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
