    "intro": "Cousinia horrida, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow to reddish flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Cousinia horrida is adapted to survive in extreme conditions, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
