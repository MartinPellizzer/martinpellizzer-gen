    "intro": "Cactus pseudomammillaris, commonly known as the silver crown cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that give it a silvery appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. Its stems are ribbed and can develop a reddish hue when exposed to intense sunlight. The flowers, which are usually yellow or orange, bloom in early spring and are followed by small, fleshy fruits."
