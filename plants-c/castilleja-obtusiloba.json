    "intro": "Castilleja obtusiloba, commonly known as the bluntleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red or orange floral bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant lacks true leaves, relying on its roots to absorb nutrients from host plants, typically grasses and shrubs. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Castilleja obtusiloba is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands."
