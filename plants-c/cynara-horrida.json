    "intro": "Cynara horrida, commonly known as the Spanish thistle, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, rough leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its robust growth habit. Cynara horrida thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or arid environments. Its hairy foliage and defensive spines are adaptations to its native climate, helping to reduce water loss and deter herbivores."
