    "intro": "Corethrodendron fruticosum var. mongolicum, commonly known as Mongolian thorny buckthorn, is a shrub native to Central Asia, particularly Mongolia and parts of Russia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, dark green leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in steppe and desert regions. Its hardy nature makes it an important component of local ecosystems and a resilient plant for ecological restoration."
