    "intro": "Cynanchum dahuricum, commonly known as the Siberian milk-vine, is a perennial herb native to the cold regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by follicles containing toxic seeds. It is known for its medicinal properties, though its sap contains cardiac glycosides that can be harmful. Due to its toxic nature, it is often avoided in traditional herbal practices."
