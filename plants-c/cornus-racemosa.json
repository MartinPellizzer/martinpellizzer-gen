    "intro": "Cornus racemosa, commonly known as red osier dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its stems are distinctive for their bright red color during the winter months. Cornus racemosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along streambanks and in wetlands."
