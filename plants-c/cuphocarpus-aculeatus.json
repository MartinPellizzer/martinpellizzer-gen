    "intro": "Cuphocarpus aculeatus, commonly known as the spiny cuppodendron, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its spiny branches and oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by distinctive cup-shaped fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry woodlands and savanna habitats. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
