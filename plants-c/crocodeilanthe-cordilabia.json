    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe cordilabia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble the appearance of a ghostly apparition, hence its common name. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for nutrient absorption from the air and surrounding environment. It thrives in humid, shaded conditions and is often found growing on the trunks of trees in tropical forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
