    "intro": "Cynosurus polybracteatus, commonly known as the many-bracted fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces numerous bracts along its stem, which are typically shorter than the leaves, giving it its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Cynosurus polybracteatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
