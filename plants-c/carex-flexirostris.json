    "intro": "Carex flexirostris, commonly known as the narrow-beak sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated, a common reproductive strategy among sedges. Carex flexirostris thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
