    "intro": "Carex tereticaulis var. typica, commonly known as slender bulblet sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil in wetland areas. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
