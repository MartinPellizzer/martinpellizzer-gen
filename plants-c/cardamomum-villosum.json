    "intro": "Cardamomum villosum, commonly known as hairy cardamom, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems covered in fine, hairy glands, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing aromatic seeds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a mild, spicy scent, contributing to its use in traditional medicine and culinary applications. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at higher elevations."
