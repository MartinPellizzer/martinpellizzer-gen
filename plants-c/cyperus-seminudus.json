    "intro": "Cyperus seminudus, commonly known as the naked sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Cyperus seminudus is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Its adaptability to moist environments makes it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
