    "intro": "Caesalpinia aphylla, commonly known as the flame tree or fire tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange inflorescences that resemble flames, which bloom during the dry season. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its bark is often smooth and reddish in color. Caesalpinia aphylla thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and coastal areas. It is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
