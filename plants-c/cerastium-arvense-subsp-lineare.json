    "intro": "Cerastium arvense subsp. lineare, commonly known as the linear mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and garden beds. It is characterized by its hairy stems and is part of the Caryophyllaceae family. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in cultivated areas."
