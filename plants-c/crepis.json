    "intro": "Crepis, commonly known as mouse-ear hawkweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of spoon-shaped leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. They are often found in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Crepis species are generally herbaceous, with some varieties being annual or perennial. Their flowers are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to their ecological importance."
