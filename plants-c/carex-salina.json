    "intro": "Carex salina, commonly known as saltmarsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces spikes of small, greenish-brown flowers. This plant thrives in brackish or saline environments, often found in salt marshes and tidal flats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in coastal areas. Carex salina plays an important ecological role in filtering water and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
