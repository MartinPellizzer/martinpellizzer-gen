    "intro": "Cayratia tenuifolia var. cinerea, commonly known as silver leaf vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are usually pale green with a bluish tinge, and the plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal. The varietal name 'cinerea' refers to its ash-gray or silvery foliage, which is a key identifying feature."
