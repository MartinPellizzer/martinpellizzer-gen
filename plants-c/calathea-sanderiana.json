    "intro": "Calathea sanderiana, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, patterned leaves that change color in response to light conditions. The leaves often fold shut at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and high humidity. Calathea sanderiana is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ease of care."
