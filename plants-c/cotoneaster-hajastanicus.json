It typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 meters, featuring dense, compact foliage with elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are attractive to birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for ornamental gardening. Cotoneaster hajastanicus is also valued for its hardiness and ability to tolerate various environmental conditions."
