    "intro": "Crepinella chimantensis subsp. chimantensis, commonly known as the Chimant\u00e9 crepefruit, is a species native to the cloud forests of northern South America. It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically yellow or orange when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the high-altitude conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
