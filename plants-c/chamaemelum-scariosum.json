    "intro": "Chamaemelum scariosum, commonly known as the scarious hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a distinctive whitish or grayish bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers, which bloom in late summer, are yellow and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
