    "intro": "Cotylelobium hopeifolium, commonly known as the Hope's cotylelobium, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to specific regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a subtle fragrance. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and potential ecological role in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
