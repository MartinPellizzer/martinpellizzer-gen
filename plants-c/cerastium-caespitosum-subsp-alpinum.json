    "intro": "Cerastium caespitosum subsp. alpinum, commonly known as alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features small, hairy leaves and white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes. Its compact growth form and frost-resistant nature make it a characteristic component of alpine flora."
