It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, sandy soils, often found in desert or semi-arid environments. The plant features a low, spreading growth habit with numerous small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
