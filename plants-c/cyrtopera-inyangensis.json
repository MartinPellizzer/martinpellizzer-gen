    "intro": "Cyrtopera inyangensis, commonly known as the Inyangensis Cyrtopera, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions in Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a velvety texture, while its flowers are often visited by hummingbirds and other pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
