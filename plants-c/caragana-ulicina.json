    "intro": "Caragana ulicina, commonly known as the shrub willow or goat willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces oval, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Caragana ulicina is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
