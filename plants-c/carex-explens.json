    "intro": "Carex explens, commonly known as the broadleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves that are typically wider and more robust than those of true grasses. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Carex explens plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
