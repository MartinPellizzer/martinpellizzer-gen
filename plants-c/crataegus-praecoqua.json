    "intro": "Crataegus praecoqua, commonly known as the early hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that ripen in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Crataegus praecoqua is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its hardy nature and ornamental features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
