    "intro": "Cypripedium lowii, commonly known as the Hainan lace fern orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Hainan Island in China. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy flowers with a distinctive pouch-like lip. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that are highly sought after by botanists and conservationists. Its habitat is threatened by deforestation and over-collection, leading to strict conservation measures. Cypripedium lowii is a key species in the study of orchid ecology and plant conservation efforts."
