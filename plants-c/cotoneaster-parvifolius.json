    "intro": "Cotoneaster parvifolius, commonly known as the small-leaved cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits in the fall. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes. Cotoneaster parvifolius is relatively low maintenance and thrives in well-drained soil in full sun to partial shade."
