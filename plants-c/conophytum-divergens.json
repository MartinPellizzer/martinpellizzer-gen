It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves. The plant has a compact growth habit with thick, ribbed leaves that can change color based on light exposure. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
