    "intro": "Cupressus macnabiana var. bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's Cupressus, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves and compact, columnar growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
