    "intro": "Chamaedorea selvae, commonly known as the mountain button fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and thrives in USDA hardiness zones 9 through 11. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clumps over time. The fronds are usually a deep green, with a leathery texture that helps the plant retain moisture in its natural habitat."
