    "intro": "Crotalaria intermedia f. sericocalyx, commonly known as the silky calyx crotalaria, is a variant of the crotalaria genus characterized by its distinctive silky, hairy calyx. This plant is native to tropical regions and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in open fields. It produces yellow flowers that are typically arranged in racemes, and its leaves are trifoliate with a velvety texture. The plant is known for its alkaloid content, which can be toxic to livestock, making it a concern in agricultural settings. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological and pharmacological studies."
