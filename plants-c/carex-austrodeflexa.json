    "intro": "Carex austrodeflexa, commonly known as the southern flexed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of eastern Australia. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as swamps and margins of water bodies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly folded, and it produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland environments. The plant is valued for its ecological role in supporting aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
