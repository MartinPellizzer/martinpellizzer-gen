    "intro": "Conchium salignum, commonly known as the salt marsh bladder, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its succulent, bladder-like leaves that store water. The plant thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in estuaries and tidal marshes. Its small, pinkish-white flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Conchium salignum plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and filtering water in its habitat."
