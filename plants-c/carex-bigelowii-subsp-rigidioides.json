    "intro": "Carex bigelowii subsp. rigidioides, commonly known as Bigelow's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and stiff, with a prominent midrib. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike of small, three-lobed flowers. The subspecies is characterized by its rigid, upright growth habit and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological value."
