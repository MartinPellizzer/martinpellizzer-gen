    "intro": "Ceradenia pseudodevoluta, commonly known as the purple-topped orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking violet or purple petals and a unique, elongated floral structure. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Ceradenia pseudodevoluta is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
