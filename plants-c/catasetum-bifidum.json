    "intro": "Catasetum bifidum, commonly known as the bifid orchid, is a tropical orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, often colorful flowers that resemble small, elongated pods. The plant produces a unique type of pollination mechanism involving a specialized structure called a \"trigger\" that releases pollen when touched. Its leaves are typically broad and lance-shaped, arranged in a rosette pattern. Catasetum bifidum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
