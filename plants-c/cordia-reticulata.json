    "intro": "Cordia reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined cordia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its rough, often fissured bark and opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with a net-like venation pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries that are an important food source for birds and mammals. Cordia reticulata is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
