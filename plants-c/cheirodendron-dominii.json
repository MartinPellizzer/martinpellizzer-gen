It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows up to 15 meters in height, with a straight trunk and a broad, rounded crown. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in clusters, and it produces woody capsules as fruit.
