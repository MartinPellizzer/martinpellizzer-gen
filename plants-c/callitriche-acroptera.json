    "intro": "Callitriche acroptera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, often in muddy or sandy substrates. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences at the water's surface. Callitriche acroptera plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and contributing to water quality through its dense vegetation."
