    "intro": "Cassia psammophila, commonly known as the desert cassia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often grayish-green and adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to thrive in harsh environments. Cassia psammophila is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
