    "intro": "Crassula depressa, commonly known as the stone plant or dwarf crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features dense, compact growth with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions with minimal care."
