    "intro": "Convolvulus willdenowii, commonly known as the yellow field bindweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves, which are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along fences. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and rhizomes, it is considered a weed in many regions."
