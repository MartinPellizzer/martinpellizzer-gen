    "intro": "Craspedaria veronicifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in some areas."
