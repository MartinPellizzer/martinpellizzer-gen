    "intro": "Carex flacca var. erecta, commonly known as the erect sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse aquatic ecosystems."
