The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the growing season. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. Crassula tenuis is popular as a low-maintenance houseplant due to its compact size and ornamental appeal."
