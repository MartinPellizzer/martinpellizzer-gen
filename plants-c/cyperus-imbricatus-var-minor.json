    "intro": "Cyperus imbricatus var. minor, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family (Poaceae). It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and shallow water areas, and is adapted to saturated soil conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly rough texture, while its flowers are small and clustered. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
