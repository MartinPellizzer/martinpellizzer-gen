    "intro": "Centaurium wigginsii, commonly known as Wiggins' centaury, is a rare flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and poor nutrient conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, seed-like fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
