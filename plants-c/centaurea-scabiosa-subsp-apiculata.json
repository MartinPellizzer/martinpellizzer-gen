It features upright, branched stems that are covered in coarse, grayish-green foliage. The plant produces showy, composite flower heads with purple to pink ray florets surrounding a yellow disk floret cluster. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This subspecies is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
