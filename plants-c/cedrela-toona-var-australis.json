    "intro": "Cedrela toona var. australis, commonly known as the Australian satinwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, glossy, ovate leaves that are often arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by woody, elongated fruits containing numerous flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its attractive wood and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and for reforestation purposes."
