    "intro": "Charybdis, commonly known as the whirlpool plant, is a unique aquatic species found in certain coastal regions. It is characterized by its spiraling, translucent fronds that resemble whirlpools in motion. The plant thrives in shallow, brackish waters where it attaches itself to submerged surfaces. Its botanical structure includes a central stem with radial branches that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night. Charybdis plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing habitat for small marine organisms."
