    "intro": "Cestrum plicatum, commonly known as the zigzag jessamine, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive zigzagging stems and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant. Its botanical features include opposite, simple leaves and a woody structure that supports its climbing or trailing growth habit."
