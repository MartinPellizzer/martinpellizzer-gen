    "intro": "Cynodon dactylon var. densus, commonly known as densest Bermuda grass, is a variant of the common Bermuda grass species. It is characterized by its dense growth habit and fine-textured blades, making it a popular choice for lawns and sports fields. This grass is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, with a deep root system that allows it to recover quickly from damage. It prefers well-drained soils and is often used in warm climates due to its heat and wear resistance. The plant reproduces through both stolons and rhizomes, enabling rapid spread and establishment."
