    "intro": "Celosia argentea, commonly known as the plume grass or crown of thorns, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery inflorescences that resemble plumes or crowns, which give it its common names. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with slender, branching stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers are usually red, orange, or yellow. Celosia argentea is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance and ability to thrive in warm climates."
