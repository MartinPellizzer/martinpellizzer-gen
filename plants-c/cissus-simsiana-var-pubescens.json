    "intro": "Cissus simsiana var. pubescens, commonly known as the velvety cissus, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, and pubescent (hairy) leaves that give it a velvety appearance. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and can be quite large for its size, often with a reddish or purplish tinge when mature. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by yellow, fleshy fruits that are edible for certain animals. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its unique foliage."
