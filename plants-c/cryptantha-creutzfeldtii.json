    "intro": "Cryptantha creutzfeldtii, commonly known as the Creutzfeldt's cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a low, mat-forming growth habit. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, cylindrical seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Cryptantha creutzfeldtii is often found in desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems."
