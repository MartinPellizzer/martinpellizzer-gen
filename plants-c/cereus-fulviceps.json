    "intro": "Cereus fulviceps, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a member of the Cactaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. These flowers have a strong, sweet fragrance and are pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths. Cereus fulviceps is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments."
