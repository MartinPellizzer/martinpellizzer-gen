    "intro": "Cyclophorus rasamalae f. minor, commonly known as the minor form of the Rasamala cyclophorus, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring a distinctive cycloid pattern that aids in water retention in its arid habitat. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with small, narrow leaves arranged in a spiral pattern around its stem. It produces tiny, pale green flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the wet season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
