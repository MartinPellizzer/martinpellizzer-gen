    "intro": "Calophanoides xylopoda, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a member of the Bignoniaceae family and is native to tropical Africa. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its thick, fissured bark and compound leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in clusters, typically in yellow or orange hues, which bloom in the dry season. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in natural habitats. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
