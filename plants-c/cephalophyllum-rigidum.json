    "intro": "Cephalophyllum rigidum, commonly known as the rigid headplant, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, erect, spineless stems that resemble small columns. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. Its leaves are fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to store water efficiently. Cephalophyllum rigidum is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal watering once established."
