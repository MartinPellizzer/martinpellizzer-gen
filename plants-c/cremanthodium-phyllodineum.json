    "intro": "Cremanthodium phyllodineum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed cremanthodium, is a small flowering plant native to the high alpine regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in harsh, cold environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss. The flowers are small and yellow, appearing in clusters, and bloom during the summer months."
