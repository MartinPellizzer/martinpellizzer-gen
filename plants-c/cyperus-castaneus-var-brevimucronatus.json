It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as swamps and seasonally flooded areas. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is distinguished by its short awns on the bracts, giving it its specific epithet."
