    "intro": "Carex rigida f. pudica, commonly known as the shaggy sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spiky cluster of small, three-ranked flowers. The varietal form, f. pudica, is distinguished by its more compact growth and shorter, more densely packed leaves compared to the typical form."
