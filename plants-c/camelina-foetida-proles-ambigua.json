    "intro": "Camelina foetida proles ambigua, commonly known as the stinking camelina, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and pinnately divided leaves, which are typical of many members of its family. The plant is native to parts of Asia and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its name refers to the strong, unpleasant odor it emits, particularly when crushed. Due to its limited distribution and unique characteristics, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
