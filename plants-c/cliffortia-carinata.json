    "intro": "Cliffortia carinata, commonly known as the mountain daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb with a compact, cushion-like growth habit, often found growing on rocky slopes and cliffs. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Cliffortia carinata is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value."
