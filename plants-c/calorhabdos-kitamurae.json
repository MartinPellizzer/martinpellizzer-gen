It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often resembling small flames. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and is typically found in lowland forests. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Calorhabdos kitamurae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
