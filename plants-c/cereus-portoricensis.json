    "intro": "Cereus portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican night blooming cereus, is a cactus native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It is a flowering plant that typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun. The plant produces striking, white, star-shaped flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its stems are cylindrical and covered in spines, which help protect it from herbivores. Cereus portoricensis is adapted to arid environments and is often found in dry, limestone-based soils."
