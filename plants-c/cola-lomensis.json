    "intro": "Cola lomensis, commonly known as African cola or cola nut, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces oval, woody fruits that contain several seeds surrounded by a sweet, aromatic pulp. Cola lomensis is cultivated for its seeds, which are used to make cola beverages and have stimulant properties due to their caffeine content. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests."
