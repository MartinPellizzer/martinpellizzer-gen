    "intro": "Cicer incanum, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is an annual legume native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a white or grayish pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that are followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several elliptical seeds. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often used as a cover crop or forage due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Its rapid growth and hardy nature make it a common weed in agricultural fields."
