    "intro": "Claytonia depressa var. arenaria, commonly known as sandstone chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features small, clustered rosettes of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its succulent leaves and ability to store water make it a resilient species in harsh, dry habitats."
