    "intro": "Ctenitis honesta, commonly known as the honest ctenitis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sorus. Ctenitis honesta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
