    "intro": "Cyperus amabilis var. oligostachyus, commonly known as the pink flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, erect stems that often grow in wet or seasonally flooded soils. The plant produces small, pinkish to reddish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in moist environments. It is often found in marshy areas, wetlands, and along the edges of ponds and lakes."
