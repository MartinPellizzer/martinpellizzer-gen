    "intro": "Cereus chalybaeus, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a cactus species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, columnar stems that are often covered with a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces striking, large, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming at night. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
