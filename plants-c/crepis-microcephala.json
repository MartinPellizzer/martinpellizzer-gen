    "intro": "Crepis microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are usually pale yellow or white, arranged in clusters. The plant produces small, achene fruits that are dispersed by wind, a common strategy among members of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its compact size and delicate appearance make it a notable species in ecological and horticultural contexts."
