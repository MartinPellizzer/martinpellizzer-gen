    "intro": "Cystopteris crispa, commonly known as the crested water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often curled or crinkled, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Cystopteris crispa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
