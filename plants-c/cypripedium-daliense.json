    "intro": "Cypripedium daliense, commonly known as the Dali lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is a unique feature among orchids. The plant typically grows in cool, shaded forest habitats, often in moist, well-drained soils. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Cypripedium daliense is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
