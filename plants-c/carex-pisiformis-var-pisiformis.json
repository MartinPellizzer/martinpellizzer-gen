    "intro": "Carex pisiformis var. pisiformis, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and slightly curved. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This species is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife."
