    "intro": "Canscora ventricosa, commonly known as the bladderleaf or mountain bladderleaf, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, an adaptation to its often arid habitat. Its small, white or pink flowers are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Canscora ventricosa is also known for its medicinal properties, used traditionally in some South American countries for its potential health benefits."
