    "intro": "Cardiandra alternifolia var. mirabilis, commonly known as the rainbow beauty, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that range from red to orange and yellow, often resembling flowers but are actually modified leaves. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and provide a lush green backdrop to its showy bracts. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This ornamental plant is often cultivated for its visual appeal in gardens and as a houseplant."
