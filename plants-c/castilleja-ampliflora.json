    "intro": "Castilleja ampliflora, commonly known as the broad-flowered Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red, orange, or yellow flowers that resemble paintbrushes. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on other plants for some of its nutrients, making it a partial parasite. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Castilleja ampliflora plays an important ecological role by providing nectar to pollinators like bees and butterflies."
