    "intro": "Cornus controversa var. alpina, commonly known as the Alpine Dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for alpine gardens. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings."
