    "intro": "Coleosanthus spinulosus var. asperatus, commonly known as the rough spinulose corymbia, is a distinctive plant with unique botanical features. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its rough, spinose bark and dense, leathery foliage. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in white or pale pink, and are followed by edible, woody fruits. This variant is native to specific regions of Australia and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
