    "intro": "Cocos nucifera var. laetevirens, commonly known as the green dwarf coconut, is a variant of the coconut palm characterized by its smaller stature and distinct foliage. This variety features narrow, dark green leaves that give it a more compact appearance compared to the standard coconut palm. The fronds are typically shorter and more upright, contributing to its unique visual identity. It produces coconuts that are generally smaller than those of the common coconut, with a slightly different flavor profile. This variety is often cultivated in tropical regions for ornamental purposes and as a source of edible coconuts."
