The plant produces distinctive spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale yellow to white flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
