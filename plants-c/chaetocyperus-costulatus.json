It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, such as marshes and wetlands. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, which are often submerged or partially submerged in water. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
