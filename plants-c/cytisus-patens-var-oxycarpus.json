It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are narrow and linear, typically arranged in pairs along the stems. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or coastal habitats. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
