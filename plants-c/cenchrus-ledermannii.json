    "intro": "Cenchrus ledermannii, commonly known as desert dropseed, is a grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are clustered at the ends of its flowering stalks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Cenchrus ledermannii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
