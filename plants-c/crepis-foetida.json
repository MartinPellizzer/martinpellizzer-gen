    "intro": "Crepis foetida, commonly known as stinking sowthistle, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It has a distinctive strong odor, which is likely a defense mechanism against herbivores. The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
