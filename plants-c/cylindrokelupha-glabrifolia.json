    "intro": "Cylindrokelupha glabrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leaved cylinder-fruit, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its cylindrical fruits and smooth, glabrous foliage. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are lanceolate and arranged alternately along the stem, while the flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
