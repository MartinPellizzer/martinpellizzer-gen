It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant features a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, adapting it to its tropical and subtropical habitats. Its flowers have a unique lyre-shaped lip, which is a distinguishing feature in the orchid family. Calanthe lyroglossa is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
