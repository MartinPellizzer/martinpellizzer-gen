    "intro": "Callista wattii, commonly known as the wattii's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark without deriving nutrients from its host. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to its restricted range and sensitivity to environmental changes, Callista wattii is considered critically endangered and is protected under Australian conservation laws."
