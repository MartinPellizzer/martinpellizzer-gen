It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences bearing tiny, spike-like flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Cymbopogon stipulatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its fine texture and resilience."
