    "intro": "Chenopodium album var. morarii, commonly known as prickly goosefoot, is an annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit and succulent, often hairy stems. The leaves are typically triangular or rhombic in shape, with a waxy coating and a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by dry, three-angled berries. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to thrive in dry, nutrient-poor environments."
