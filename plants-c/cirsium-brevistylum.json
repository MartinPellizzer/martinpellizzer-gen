    "intro": "Cirsium brevistylum, commonly known as the short-stemmed thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, gray-green leaves and purple to pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and thrives in well-drained soils. It is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its defensive spines that deter herbivores. Cirsium brevistylum is often found in rocky or alpine habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
