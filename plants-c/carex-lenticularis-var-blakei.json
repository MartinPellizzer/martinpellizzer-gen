    "intro": "Carex lenticularis var. blakei, commonly known as the Blake's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands or along the edges of ponds and streams. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is distinguished by its slightly larger leaves and more robust growth compared to the typical Carex lenticularis."
