    "intro": "Cyclosorus acanthocarpus, commonly known as the hairy cyclosorus, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the family Ceratophyllaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its reproductive structures, known as carpels, are clustered in a central whorl, a feature that sets it apart from other aquatic plants. Cyclosorus acanthocarpus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through oxygen production."
