    "intro": "Crocodilodes speciosa, commonly known as the ornamental crocodile plant, is a striking member of the Araliaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its large, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that resemble the scales of a crocodile. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance, it is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
