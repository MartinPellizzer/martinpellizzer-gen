    "intro": "Castilleja mendocinensis, commonly known as Mendocino Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Northern California. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It forms symbiotic relationships with certain root fungi, which help it obtain nutrients from the soil. Castilleja mendocinensis is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as coastal bluffs and grasslands."
