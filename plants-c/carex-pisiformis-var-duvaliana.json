    "intro": "Carex pisiformis var. duvaliana, commonly known as Duval's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and have a smooth texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer, with pale green to brownish flowers. It is often found in areas with consistently moist soil, such as along stream banks or in swamps. Due to its preference for wet conditions, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
