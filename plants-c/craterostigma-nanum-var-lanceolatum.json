It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of pale pink or violet flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
