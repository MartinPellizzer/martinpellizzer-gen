    "intro": "Chorisepalum breweri, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, capsule-like fruits that release seeds with silky hairs. Its botanical features include a taproot system and the absence of true petals, with sepals that resemble petals. Chorisepalum breweri is adapted to drought conditions and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
