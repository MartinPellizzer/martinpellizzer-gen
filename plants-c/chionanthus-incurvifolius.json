It is characterized by its narrow, curling leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in panicles. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
