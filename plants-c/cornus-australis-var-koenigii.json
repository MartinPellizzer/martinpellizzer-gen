    "intro": "Cornus australis var. koenigii, commonly known as the Koenig's dogwood, is a variant of the European dogwood native to southern Europe. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its bright yellow flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value lies in its vibrant floral display and attractive, peeling bark."
