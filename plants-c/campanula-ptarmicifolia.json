    "intro": "Campanula ptarmicifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often tinged with silver, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Campanula ptarmicifolia is valued for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
