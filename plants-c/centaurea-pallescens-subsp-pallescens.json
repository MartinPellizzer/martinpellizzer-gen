It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a habitat for small invertebrates."
