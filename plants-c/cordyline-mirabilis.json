    "intro": "Cordyline mirabilis, commonly known as the red torch ginger, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of vivid red bracts that resemble torches, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the axils of the bracts. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a bluish-green hue with prominent veins. Cordyline mirabilis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its dramatic visual impact in gardens and landscapes."
