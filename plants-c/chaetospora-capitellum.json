    "intro": "Chaetospora capitellum, commonly known as the purple sea lettuce, is a marine green alga that thrives in coastal and estuarine environments. It forms dense, mat-like growths on rocky substrates, often in shallow, tide-pooled areas. The plant has a simple, blade-like structure with a smooth, waxy surface that aids in reducing water loss. Its reproductive structures, called conceptacles, are embedded within the thallus and produce gametes for sexual reproduction. Chaetospora capitellum plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
