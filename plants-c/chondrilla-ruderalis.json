    "intro": "Chondrilla ruderalis, commonly known as the rough chondrilla, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Central Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as those found along roadsides and in arable fields, making it a common weed in agricultural areas. It has small, ovate leaves with a rough texture and produces pods that contain several seeds. Due to its adaptability and rapid growth, it is often considered a problematic species in certain ecosystems."
