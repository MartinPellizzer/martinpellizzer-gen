    "intro": "Crinum pratense var. longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved swamp lily, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features strap-like, lance-shaped leaves that are often several inches long, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in moist, swampy conditions, making it a characteristic species of wetlands. The foliage and flowers are often used in ornamental gardening due to their aesthetic appeal and ecological value."
