    "intro": "Callista aphylla, commonly known as the leafless chaliceflower, is a unique member of the Apocynaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of central Australia, where it thrives in harsh, dry environments. The plant is characterized by its absence of leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its smooth, green stems. Its striking, bell-shaped flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters during the warmer months. Despite its lack of foliage, Callista aphylla is an important component of its ecosystem, providing nectar for native pollinators."
