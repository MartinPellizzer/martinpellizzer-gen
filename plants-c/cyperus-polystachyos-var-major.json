    "intro": "Cyperus polystachyos var. major, commonly known as the broadleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a common weed and an important component of wetland ecosystems."
