    "intro": "Cuprella, commonly known as the cup fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cup-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Cuprella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
