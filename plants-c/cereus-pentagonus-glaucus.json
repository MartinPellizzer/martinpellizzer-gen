    "intro": "Cereus pentagonus glaucus, commonly known as the Blue Cereus, is a species of cactus native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking white flowers that bloom at night, often during the summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in its arid environment. This plant is well adapted to coastal and rocky habitats, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil."
