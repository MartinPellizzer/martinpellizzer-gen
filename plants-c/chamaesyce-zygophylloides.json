    "intro": "Chamaesyce zygophylloides, commonly known as the zigleaf sandwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Portulacaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are typically oval or lance-shaped and may have a slightly zigzag or undulating edge, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments."
