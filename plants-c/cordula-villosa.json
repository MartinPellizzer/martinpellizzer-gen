It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name and help in identifying it in the field. Its flowers typically bloom in the summer, producing small yellow blooms that attract pollinators. Cordula villosa is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks."
