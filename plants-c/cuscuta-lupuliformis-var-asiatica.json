    "intro": "Cuscuta lupuliformis var. asiatica, commonly known as Asian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrition. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to Asia and is often found on crops such as soybeans and rice. Its seeds are dispersed by wind and can remain viable in soil for several years. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
