    "intro": "Cardamine marholdii, commonly known as Marhold's watercress, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are typically submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five sepals and numerous stamens, which are often borne on slender pedicels. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to anchor in muddy or sandy substrates in freshwater habitats. Cardamine marholdii is typically found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and wetlands across temperate regions of Europe."
