It is a perennial herb native to Central Asia, typically found in rocky or alpine environments. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
