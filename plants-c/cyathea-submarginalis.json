    "intro": "Cyathea submarginalis, commonly known as the marginal tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical forests. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which is a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. This species plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various organisms."
