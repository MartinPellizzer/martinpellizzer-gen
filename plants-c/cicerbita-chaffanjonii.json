    "intro": "Cicerbita chaffanjonii, commonly known as the Chaffanjon's cicerbita, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. Native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features slender, branched stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. Its small, white to yellowish flowers appear in clustered umbels, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
