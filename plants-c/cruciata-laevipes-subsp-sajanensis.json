    "intro": "Cruciata laevipes subsp. sajanensis, commonly known as the Sajan crucifix, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its distinctive cruciform (cross-shaped) flowers, which are typically white or pale pink. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, alternate leaves with a hairy texture. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
