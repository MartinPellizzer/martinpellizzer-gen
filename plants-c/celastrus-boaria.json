It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture, while its stems are often covered in fine, white hairs. Celastrus boaria is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade."
