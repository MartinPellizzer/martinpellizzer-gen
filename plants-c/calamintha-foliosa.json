    "intro": "Calamintha foliosa, commonly known as leafy calamintha, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs such as mint and lavender. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. Its small, pale blue or purple flowers appear in whorled clusters along the upper stems, typically blooming in late summer. Calamintha foliosa is valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
