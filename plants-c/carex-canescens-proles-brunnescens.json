It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually grayish-green in color, with a rough texture. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike that bears small, wind-pollinated flowers. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife."
