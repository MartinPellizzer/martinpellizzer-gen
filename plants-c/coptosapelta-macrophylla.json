It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing a unique habitat for various aquatic life. The plant's leaves are buoyant and have a waxy surface to prevent water from penetrating, while its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate. Coptosapelta macrophylla produces showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting pollinators such as moths. This plant plays a vital role in the ecosystem by stabilizing water bodies and supporting biodiversity."
