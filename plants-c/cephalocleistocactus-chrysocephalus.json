    "intro": "Cephalocleistocactus chrysocephalus, commonly known as the golden-head cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically green with a bluish tint. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that appear at the top of the stems during the spring and summer months. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to drought conditions. The flowers are often followed by small, rounded fruits that contain seeds."
