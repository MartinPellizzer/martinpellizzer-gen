    "intro": "Crepidorhopalon symoensii, commonly known as the Malagasy starling orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that display a vibrant mix of purple and white hues. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its slender, wiry stems and small, lance-shaped leaves are adapted to its tropical climate. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
