    "intro": "Chrysopsis resinolens var. ciliata, commonly known as the silky goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow, daisy-like flowers and hairy, glandular leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, ciliate (fringed) hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
