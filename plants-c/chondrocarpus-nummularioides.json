It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in wetlands and marshy areas. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth form with closely packed, grass-like leaves. Its small, clustered inflorescences produce tiny, three-lobed flowers that are often greenish or reddish in color. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging wetland environments."
