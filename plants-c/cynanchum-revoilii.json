    "intro": "Cynanchum revoilii, commonly known as Chinese milkvetch, is a climbing perennial plant native to China. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by follicles containing seeds with silky hairs. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological and pharmacological studies."
