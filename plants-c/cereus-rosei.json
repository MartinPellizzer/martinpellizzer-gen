It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and is a member of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its flowers typically bloom only once a year, making it a rare and striking sight. Cereus rosei is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming habit."
