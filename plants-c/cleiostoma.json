    "intro": "Cleiostoma, commonly known as the evergreen vine, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, simple leaves that are often heart-shaped. The flowers are typically small and clustered, with five petals that are usually white or pale in color. Cleiostoma species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in countries like Brazil and Mexico. These plants are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to climb structures."
