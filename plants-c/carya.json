    "intro": "Carya, commonly known as hickory, is a genus of deciduous trees and shrubs native to the Americas. These plants are characterized by their thick, ridged bark and alternate, simple leaves that often have a serrated edge. The fruit of Carya species is a hard-shelled nut enclosed in a spiny husk, typically containing one or two seeds. Hickories are valued for their strong, durable wood, which is used in furniture, tool handles, and smoking meats. They also play an important ecological role in supporting wildlife and maintaining forest biodiversity."
