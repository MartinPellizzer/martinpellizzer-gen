    "intro": "Cerastium fischerianum f. molle, commonly known as the soft-stemmed mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving the plant a soft, velvety texture. The flowers are white, five-petaled, and borne in clusters at the ends of the stems, adding a delicate floral display in early spring. This plant thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a desirable plant for native gardens and ecological restoration projects."
