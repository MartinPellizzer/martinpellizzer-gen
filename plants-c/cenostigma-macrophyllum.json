    "intro": "Cenostigma macrophyllum, commonly known as the giant leaf cycad, is a striking member of the Cycadaceae family native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach lengths of up to three meters, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant has a thick, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy material that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Its reproductive structures include a large, cone-like strobilus that produces both male and female spores. Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable and often threatened species in its native habitat."
