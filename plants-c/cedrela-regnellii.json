    "intro": "Cedrela regnellii, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Africa and parts of the Americas. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, simple leaves that are alternate and elliptic in shape. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species in many regions."
