    "intro": "Cormus, commonly known as the umbrella plant, is a member of the Araceae family. It is characterized by its underground corm, which serves as a storage organ for nutrients. The plant produces a tall, leafy stalk topped with an umbrella-like inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The botanical features of Cormus make it an important species in ecological studies and horticulture."
