    "intro": "Cineraria campestris var. umbellata, commonly known as the Umbellate Cineraria, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces showy, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to tolerate coastal conditions and its long blooming period."
