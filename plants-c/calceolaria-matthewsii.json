    "intro": "Calceolaria matthewsii, commonly known as the Matthews' slipper orchid, is a strikingly unique plant belonging to the Campanulaceae family. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, specifically Ecuador, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. The plant is characterized by its distinctive calyces, which resemble small slippers, and its vibrant, often bi-colored flowers. Calceolaria matthewsii is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils, growing in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
