    "intro": "Cochlearia acutangula, commonly known as the sharp-leaved cochlearia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and small, lobed leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer. Native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
