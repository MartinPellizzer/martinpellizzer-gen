    "intro": "Ceratostema nanum, commonly known as the dwarf star-of-Bethlehem, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of China. It features delicate, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in garden landscapes."
