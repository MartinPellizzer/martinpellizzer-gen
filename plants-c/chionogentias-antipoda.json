    "intro": "Chionogentias antipoda, commonly known as the Southern Skyflower, is a rare alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments where it forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant features small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring, often in clusters at the ends of its hairy stems. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs that help reduce water loss. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat disruption."
