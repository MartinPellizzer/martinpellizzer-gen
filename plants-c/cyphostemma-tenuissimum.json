It belongs to the family Pedaliaceae and is characterized by its thin, twining stems and small, alternate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, dry fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xerophytic gardens and for erosion control."
