It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a small, red drupe that matures in late summer. Caprifolium ovatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
