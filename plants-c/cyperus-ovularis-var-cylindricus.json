    "intro": "Cyperus ovularis var. cylindricus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, clustered flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Cyperus ovularis var. cylindricus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
