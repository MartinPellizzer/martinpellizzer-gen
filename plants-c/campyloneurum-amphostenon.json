    "intro": "Campyloneurum amphostenon, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, translucent scales. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
