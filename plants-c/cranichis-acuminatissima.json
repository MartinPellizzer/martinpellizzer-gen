    "intro": "Cranichis acuminatissima, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. The plant features a slender, upright stem with a single, narrow leaf and a spike of small, greenish-white flowers. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
