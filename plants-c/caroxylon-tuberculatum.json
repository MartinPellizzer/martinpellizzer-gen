    "intro": "Caroxylon tuberculatum, commonly known as the African sandthorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange to red fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
