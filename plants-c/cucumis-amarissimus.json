    "intro": "Cucumis amarissimus, commonly known as the bitter cucumber, is a species of flowering plant in the Cucurbitaceae family. It is characterized by its small, elongated fruits that are typically green and covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers and has a vine-like growth habit, often climbing or trailing along the ground. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and have a slightly serrated edge. The fruit is known for its bitter taste, which is due to the presence of cucurbitacins, making it less suitable for culinary use but valuable in traditional medicine."
