It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its segmented, branching stems that resemble a tree. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom during the holiday season, typically from November to January. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it thrives in bright, indirect light with well-draining soil. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
