    "intro": "Ciminalis saponaria, commonly known as soapwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, covered in woolly, gray-green foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is known for containing saponins, which give it its name and make it useful in traditional soap-making. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks."
