    "intro": "Calamus rugosus, commonly known as the rough reed or zigzag sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often exhibit a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture that distinguishes it from other sedges. Calamus rugosus produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the summer months."
