    "intro": "Caralluma marlothii, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a feature that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Caralluma marlothii is also known for its ability to store water in its thick stems, making it well-adapted to survive in drought conditions."
