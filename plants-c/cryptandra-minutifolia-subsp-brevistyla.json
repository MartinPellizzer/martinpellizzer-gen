    "intro": "Cryptandra minutifolia subsp. brevistyla, commonly known as the narrow-styled cryptandra, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Australia. It features small, glandular leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is a member of the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and other aromatic plants. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
