    "intro": "Carex deweyana var. collectanea, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It typically forms dense, mat-like clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often dark green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, bogs, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland environments."
