    "intro": "Cardamine macrophylla var. lobata, commonly known as the broad-leaf watercress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lobed, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery taste similar to that of watercress."
