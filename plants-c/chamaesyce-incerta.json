    "intro": "Chamaesyce incerta, commonly known as the uncertain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are often prostrate or ascending, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. Chamaesyce incerta is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
