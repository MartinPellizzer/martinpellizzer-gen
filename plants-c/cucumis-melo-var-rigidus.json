    "intro": "Cucumis melo var. rigidus, commonly known as the Persian cucumber, is a variety of melon characterized by its elongated, ribbed fruit. The plant produces a trailing vine with hairy stems and broad, lobed leaves. Its flowers are typically yellow and occur in the axils of the leaves. The fruit is generally smaller than common melons, with a firm, crisp texture and a mild, sweet flavor. It is cultivated for both ornamental purposes and as a edible crop in certain regions."
