    "intro": "Cristaria trifida, commonly known as the three-lobed marsh plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features delicate, trifid (three-lobed) leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially along the margins. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist soils. Cristaria trifida plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
