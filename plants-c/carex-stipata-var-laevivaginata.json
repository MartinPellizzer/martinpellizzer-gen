    "intro": "Carex stipata var. laevivaginata, commonly known as the smooth sheath sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, cylindrical stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are typically narrow and flat, with a smooth, waxy surface that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along streambanks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments."
