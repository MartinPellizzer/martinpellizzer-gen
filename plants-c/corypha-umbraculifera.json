It is characterized by its massive, umbrella-shaped crown composed of long, arching leaves. The plant has a thick, woody trunk that can grow up to 20 meters in height. Its leaves are typically green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside. Corypha umbraculifera thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense tropical forests."
