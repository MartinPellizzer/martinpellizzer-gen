    "intro": "Crataegus coriacea, commonly known as the rough pear or prickly pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red or orange berries that are typically eaten by birds and other wildlife. Crataegus coriacea is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils. Its hardy nature makes it adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions."
