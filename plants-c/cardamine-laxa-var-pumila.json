    "intro": "Cardamine laxa var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf water shield, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It features delicate, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist environments. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
