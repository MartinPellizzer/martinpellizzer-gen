It is characterized by its tall, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. This species thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, bogs, and the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical cluster of spikelets that bloom in late summer. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
