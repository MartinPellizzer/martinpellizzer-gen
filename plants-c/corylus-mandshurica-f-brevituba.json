    "intro": "Corylus mandshurica f. brevituba, commonly known as the Manchurian hazelnut, is a variant of the hazelnut plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and hairy stems, which distinguish it from other hazelnut species. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges and a hairy underside, contributing to its unique appearance. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and it produces edible nuts enclosed in a thick, woody husk. This plant is often grown for its ornamental value and for the nutritional benefits of its nuts."
