    "intro": "Cacalia sessilis, commonly known as the sessile cacalia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stem-like base. The small, daisy-like flowers are usually pink to purple in color and bloom in the summer months."
