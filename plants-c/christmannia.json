    "intro": "Christmannia, commonly known as the desert broom, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are shrubs or small trees with woody stems and small, often spiny leaves. They produce yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by legume-like pods containing seeds. Christmannia species are adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and efficient water use strategies."
