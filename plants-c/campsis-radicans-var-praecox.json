    "intro": "Campsis radicans var. praecox, commonly known as the early trumpetvine, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces striking orange-red tubular flowers in late spring, which attract hummingbirds and other pollinators. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its rapid growth and showy blooms make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
