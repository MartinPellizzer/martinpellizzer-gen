    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 buchananianum, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China and Korea. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pink or white with a yellowish or orange lip, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
