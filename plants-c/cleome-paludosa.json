    "intro": "Cleome paludosa, commonly known as swamp cleome, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers with five petals, which bloom throughout the summer months. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in moist environments, making it ecologically significant in wetland restoration. Cleome paludosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poorly drained soils."
