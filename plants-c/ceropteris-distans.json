    "intro": "Ceropteris distans, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and swamps, where it forms dense floating mats. The plant has long, narrow fronds that are typically divided into small, finger-like segments, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its rhizomes spread across the water surface, anchoring the plant and facilitating the growth of new fronds. Ceropteris distans plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various aquatic organisms."
