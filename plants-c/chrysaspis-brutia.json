    "intro": "Chrysaspis brutia, commonly known as the golden spider orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Peru and Bolivia. The plant is characterized by its vibrant golden-yellow flowers, which are adorned with intricate patterns resembling spider webs. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it attaches itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Chrysaspis brutia is considered a threatened species."
