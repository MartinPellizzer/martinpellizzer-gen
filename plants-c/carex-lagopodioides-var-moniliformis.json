It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, spikelet-bearing flowers in the summer. Its botanical structure includes a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread vegetatively. It is often found in wetland ecosystems and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
