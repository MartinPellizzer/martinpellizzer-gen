    "intro": "Chamaecrista glandulosa var. crystallina, commonly known as the crystalline burr legume, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, glandular-hairy stems and compound leaves with small, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers arranged in clusters, followed by elongated, woody pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine."
