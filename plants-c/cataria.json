    "intro": "Cataria, commonly known as catnip, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cataria contains high levels of nepetalactone, a compound responsible for its stimulating effect on cats. It is also used in herbal medicine for its calming properties in humans."
