    "intro": "Cynometra riedeliana, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing smooth, glossy seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
