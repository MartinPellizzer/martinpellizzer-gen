    "intro": "Carduus scolymus, commonly known as common sowthistle, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lobed leaves and a tall, branched stem that bears yellow flowers. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant has been used historically for its medicinal properties, though it is also considered a weed in agricultural settings. Its life cycle is typically annual, with seeds dispersed by wind."
