    "intro": "Campylotropis bonatiana, commonly known as the Bonati's climbing bottlebrush, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and clusters of small, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that appear in late spring. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with ovate to lanceolate leaflets, and its flowers are arranged in dense, bottlebrush-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a climbing plant in shaded areas. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
