    "intro": "Carex remota subsp. rochebrunei, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky or alpine environments, often in mountain meadows and forest edges. It has fibrous roots and produces small, triangular seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
