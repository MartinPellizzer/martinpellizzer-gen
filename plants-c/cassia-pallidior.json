    "intro": "Cassia pallidior, commonly known as the pale cassia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and often compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by elongated pods containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two levels of leaflets, giving it a delicate, feathery appearance. Cassia pallidior is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
