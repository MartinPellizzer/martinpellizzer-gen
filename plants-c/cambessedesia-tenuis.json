    "intro": "Cambessedesia tenuis, commonly known as the slender leaf cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, which is a defining feature of cycads. Its growth is slow, and it can live for several decades, making it a long-lived plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
