    "intro": "Cupressus rushforthii, commonly known as the Sierra Madre cypress, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and scale-like foliage that is dense and dark green. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, typical of the Cupressaceae family. Its bark is reddish-brown and exfoliates to reveal a smooth, pale inner layer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
