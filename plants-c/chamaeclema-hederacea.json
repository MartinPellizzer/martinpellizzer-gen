    "intro": "Chamaeclema hederacea, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread gradually, forming dense mats. It is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora in forest ecosystems."
