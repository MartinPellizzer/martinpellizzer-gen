    "intro": "Catimbaua, commonly known as the Brazilian water lily, is a aquatic plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Nymphaeaceae and is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle that helps repel water, while its roots anchor it in the substrate. Catimbaua plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
