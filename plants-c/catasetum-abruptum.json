    "intro": "Catasetum abruptum, commonly known as the abrupt cat slip, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, often colorful flowers that can range from yellow to red, with a distinctive lip that is modified into a specialized structure for pollination. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are highly adapted for pollination by specific insects, particularly bees, due to their unique shape and scent. Catasetum abruptum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its vibrant blooms."
