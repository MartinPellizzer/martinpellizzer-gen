    "intro": "Cladoceras subcapitatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water clover, is a species of aquatic plant characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has a creeping rhizome that helps it spread across the substrate. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually borne in clusters and are pollinated by insects. Cladoceras subcapitatum plays a role in stabilizing aquatic habitats and providing shelter for small aquatic organisms."
