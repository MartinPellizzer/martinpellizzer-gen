    "intro": "Cyathanthus, commonly known as the Christmas star, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. It is native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe, characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers. The plants typically grow as shrubs or subshrubs, with woody stems and small, evergreen leaves. Cyathanthus species are valued for their ornamental appeal, particularly during the holiday season when they bloom. They require well-drained soil and full sun to thrive, making them suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
