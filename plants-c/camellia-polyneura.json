    "intro": "Camellia polyneura, commonly known as the Japanese camellia, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan and southern Korea. It is characterized by its striking, large, glossy dark green leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces showy, camellia-like flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It prefers partial shade and well-drained, acidic soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Camellia polyneura is also valued for its ability to thrive in cooler climates and its resistance to many common garden pests."
