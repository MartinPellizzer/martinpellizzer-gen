    "intro": "Ceterach aureum, commonly known as golden corymbia, is a species of flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a small, shrub-like plant with dense, leathery foliage that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are often used in traditional Aboriginal medicine for their purported healing properties. Ceterach aureum is well adapted to coastal environments and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
