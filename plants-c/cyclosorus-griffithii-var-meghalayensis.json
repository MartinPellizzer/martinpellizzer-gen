    "intro": "Cyclosorus griffithii var. meghalayensis, commonly known as the Meghalaya cyclosorus, is a rare fern species native to the northeastern region of India. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds with a distinctive veining pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountain forests, where it thrives in the cool, humid climate. Its spores are released from terminal clusters on the fronds, a common reproductive strategy among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
