    "intro": "Cyathea hymenodes, commonly known as the silver tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately divided fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are typically covered in a dense layer of silvery, woolly hair, giving the plant its common name. Cyathea hymenodes grows in humid, shaded environments, often near streams or in forest understories. Its slow growth and unique appearance make it a popular ornamental plant in tropical gardens."
