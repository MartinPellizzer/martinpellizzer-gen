    "intro": "Cerastium holostea, commonly known as the snow-in-summer, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, giving it its common name. The plant has a mat-forming habit with numerous stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its frost-resistant nature. Cerastium holostea is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
