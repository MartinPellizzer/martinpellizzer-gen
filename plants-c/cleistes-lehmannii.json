    "intro": "Cleistes lehmannii, commonly known as the lemon-scented orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has a short, hairy stem and produces a single, showy bloom that often has a lemon-like scent. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in swampy areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
