    "intro": "Chionochloa archboldii, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, silky leaves that are adapted to cold and arid conditions. This plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Chionochloa archboldii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife."
