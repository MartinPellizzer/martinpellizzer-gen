    "intro": "Cereus campinensis subsp. piedadensis, commonly known as the Piedad Cereus, is a species of cactus native to Colombia. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom at night, a common trait among many cacti in the Cereus genus. Its leaves are reduced to spines, typical of arid environments, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. This subspecies is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry conditions."
