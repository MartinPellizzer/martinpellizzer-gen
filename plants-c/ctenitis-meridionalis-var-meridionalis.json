    "intro": "Ctenitis meridionalis var. meridionalis, commonly known as the southern ctenitis, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a serrated edge. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 30 inches, making it a notable presence in its native habitat."
