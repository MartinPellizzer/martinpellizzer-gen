    "intro": "Cerastium decalvans var. albanicum, commonly known as the Albanian mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. Its leaves are usually rounded and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. This variant is distinguished by its slightly reduced calyx and is often found in rocky or disturbed soils."
