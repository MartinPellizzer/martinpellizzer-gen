    "intro": "Caladenia georgei, commonly known as George's Spider-orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and its distinctive, spider-like flowers that are typically pale green with red and yellow markings. The plant produces a single, narrow leaf and blooms from late autumn to early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
