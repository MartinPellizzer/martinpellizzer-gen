    "intro": "Cissus macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leafed grape ivy, is a climbing plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, grape-like berries. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often used as a decorative vine in tropical gardens. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor cultivation."
