    "intro": "Cynanchum luteum, commonly known as yellow milkweed, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and milky sap, which are typical features of the Asclepiadaceae family. The plant typically grows in moist environments such as wet meadows and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a hairy texture. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release its seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
