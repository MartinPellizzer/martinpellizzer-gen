It is characterized by its hairy, branching stems and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
