It features dense, rounded foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for Mediterranean climates. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
