    "intro": "Cardamine tuberosa var. granulata, commonly known as the granulate watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in small, rounded tubers that store nutrients. The plant produces delicate, fern-like leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and small white or greenish flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. Its unique tuberous roots and ornamental foliage make it a distinctive addition to wetland gardens."
