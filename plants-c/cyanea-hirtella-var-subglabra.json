    "intro": "Cyanea hirtella var. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth Cyanea, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical, with a smooth texture that distinguishes it from other varieties of Cyanea. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in coastal and lowland forest areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
