    "intro": "Chrysothamnus nauseosus subsp. leiospermus, commonly known as the yellow rabbitbrush, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellow-orange inflorescences and silver-gray foliage, which are adaptations to arid environments. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces numerous small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats. The subspecies leiospermus is distinguished by its smoother, less hairy stems compared to other subspecies of Chrysothamnus."
