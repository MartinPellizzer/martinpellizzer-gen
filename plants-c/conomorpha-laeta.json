    "intro": "Conomorpha laeta, commonly known as the golden leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, golden-yellow leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, preferring rich, organic soil. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in humid conditions. Conomorpha laeta is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
