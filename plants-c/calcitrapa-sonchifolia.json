    "intro": "Calcitrapa sonchifolia, commonly known as the sandbur, is an annual flowering plant native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and herbaceous growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as fields and roadsides. Its leaves are lance-shaped with rough textures, and it produces small, spiny seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its adaptability, it is considered a weed in many regions but also serves as a food source for certain insect species."
