    "intro": "Carex atropurpurea, commonly known as purple moor grass, is a perennial sedge native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, grass-like foliage that turns a striking purple hue in the autumn. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and marshy areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners looking to add texture and color to water features or bog gardens."
