    "intro": "Cystopteris altajensis, commonly known as the Altai water fern, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae). It is a small, terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble a water lily. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Cystopteris altajensis is native to Central Asia, particularly found in regions like the Altai Mountains."
