    "intro": "Cybianthus silvestris, commonly known as the wild thimbleweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. It features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and clustered in a conical shape. Cybianthus silvestris is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
