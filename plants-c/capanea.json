    "intro": "Capanea, commonly known as the bottlebrush plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive inflorescences, which resemble bottle brushes due to their dense clusters of red or pink flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a glossy surface. Native to Australia, Capanea species are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens. These plants thrive in well-drained soil and full sun, making them suitable for coastal and Mediterranean climates."
