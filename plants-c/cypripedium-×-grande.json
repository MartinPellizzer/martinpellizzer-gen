    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 grande, commonly known as the large white lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, loamy soils. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single flower per stem. Due to its ornamental value and rarity in the wild, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
