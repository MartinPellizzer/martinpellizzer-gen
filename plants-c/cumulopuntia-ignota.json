    "intro": "Cumulopuntia ignota, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Cumulopuntia ignota is adapted to extreme drought conditions and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils."
