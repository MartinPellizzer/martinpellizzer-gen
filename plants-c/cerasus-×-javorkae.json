It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its ornamental value, particularly during the spring when it produces clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 3\u20135 meters and features ovate leaves with serrated edges. Its fruit, a small cherry-like drupe, is edible but less commonly cultivated for consumption.
