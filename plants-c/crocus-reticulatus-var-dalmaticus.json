    "intro": "Crocus reticulatus var. dalmaticus, commonly known as the Dalmatian crocus, is a species of flowering plant in the Iridaceae family. It is native to the Balkan Peninsula and parts of southern Europe, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces striking violet or purple flowers with a reticulated pattern on the petals, which are typically 2\u20133 inches in diameter. It blooms in late winter to early spring, often before the leaves emerge, making it a notable early-flowering plant. The bulbs are perennial, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens."
