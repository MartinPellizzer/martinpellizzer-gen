    "intro": "Cycas ophiolitica, commonly known as the Ophiolite Cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to southern China. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or limestone soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
