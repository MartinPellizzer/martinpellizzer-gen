    "intro": "Centropogon costaricae f. dentatus, commonly known as the toothed centropogon, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The leaves are typically elliptical with serrated edges, and the plant exhibits a compact growth habit. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
