    "intro": "Canella laurifolia, commonly known as the white sand tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by oval, woody fruits containing smooth, black seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or disturbed habitats. Canella laurifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local cultures."
