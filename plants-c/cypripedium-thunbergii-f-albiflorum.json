    "intro": "Cypripedium thunbergii f. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to parts of East Asia. This hybrid variety is characterized by its pale white petals and a distinctive, pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soils. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
