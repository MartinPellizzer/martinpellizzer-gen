    "intro": "Costus echinatus, commonly known as the spiny costus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes gingers and related plants. The plant features elongated, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of small, pale yellow to orange flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. The spiny bracts that surround the flower clusters are a distinctive botanical feature of this species."
