It belongs to the family Vitaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, fig-like fruits. The plant thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing on cliffs or walls. Its stems are succulent and can store water, aiding in survival in dry conditions. The leaves are typically pubescent, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss."
