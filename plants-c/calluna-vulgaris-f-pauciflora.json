    "intro": "Calluna vulgaris f. pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered heather, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to western Europe. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense foliage of small, leathery leaves. The plant produces fewer flowers compared to the typical Calluna vulgaris, with pale pink to white blooms that appear in late summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and moorlands. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground cover in challenging garden conditions."
