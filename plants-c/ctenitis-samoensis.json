It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a dense mass of leaf bases. The plant produces large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting its growth in moist, shaded environments. Ctenitis samoensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various species."
