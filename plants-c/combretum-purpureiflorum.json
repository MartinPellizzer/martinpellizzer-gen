    "intro": "Combretum purpureiflorum, commonly known as the purple-flowered combretum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Combretum purpureiflorum is often found in woodland and savanna habitats, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
