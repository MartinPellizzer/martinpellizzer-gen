    "intro": "Cenchrus durus, commonly known as the hard panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, rigid blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown spikelets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Cenchrus durus is often used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock in dry environments."
