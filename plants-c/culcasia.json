It features large, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length, making it a striking addition to water gardens. The plant thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its rhizomes are edible and have been used in traditional cuisines. Culcasia is also valued for its ability to purify water and provide habitat for aquatic life."
