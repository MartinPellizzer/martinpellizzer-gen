    "intro": "Caryocar tessmannii, commonly known as the Brazilian chestnut, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the family Caryocaraceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by distinctive, round, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed. The fruit's outer layer is thick and fleshy, which aids in seed dispersal by animals. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some traditional uses in local communities."
