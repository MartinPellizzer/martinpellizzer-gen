    "intro": "Cylindropuntia imbricata var. spinosior, commonly known as the spiny cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in clusters of spines, which are often more pronounced than in other varieties. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its stems are typically segmented and can grow up to several feet in length, making it a distinctive and recognizable plant in arid environments. The spiny cholla is well adapted to drought and full sun, thriving in sandy or rocky soils."
