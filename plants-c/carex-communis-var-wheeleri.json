    "intro": "Carex communis var. wheeleri, commonly known as Wheeler's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known for their ability to thrive in moist environments. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams, where it forms dense, grass-like clumps. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive blue-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
