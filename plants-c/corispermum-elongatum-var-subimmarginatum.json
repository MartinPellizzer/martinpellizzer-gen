    "intro": "Corispermum elongatum var. subimmarginatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The leaves are linear to lanceolate, typically arranged in a spiral along the stems, and are usually covered with a dense layer of white, powdery wax. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and bloom in late summer. This plant is well adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system and the ability to store water in its thick stems."
