    "intro": "Carex kelloggii var. limnophila, commonly known as the swamp sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale to brownish flowers, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its preference for aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, it plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
