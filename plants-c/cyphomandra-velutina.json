    "intro": "Cyphomandra velutina, commonly known as the velvet apple or yellow eggplant, is a tropical vine native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by egg-shaped fruits with a smooth, waxy skin. The fruits are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature, though they are not typically eaten by humans. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive appearance and unique foliage."
