    "intro": "Cathedra crassifolia, commonly known as the thickleaf cathedra, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, fleshy leaves that are thick and succulent, adapted to store water in its native environment. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate touch to its rugged appearance. Its growth habit is low and compact, often forming a mat-like structure that helps it thrive in harsh conditions. Cathedra crassifolia is valued in horticulture for its resilience and ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
