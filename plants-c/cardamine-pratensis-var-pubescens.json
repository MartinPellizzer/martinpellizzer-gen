    "intro": "Cardamine pratensis var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy water crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist meadows and stream banks in temperate regions. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a dense, upright inflorescence, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its root system consists of rhizomes that help anchor it in wet soils and facilitate vegetative propagation. The hairy pubescence on its leaves and stems is a distinguishing characteristic that aids in reducing water loss and providing protection against herbivory."
