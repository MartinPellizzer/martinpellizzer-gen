    "intro": "Coprosma depressa, commonly known as the prostrate coprosma, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It features dense, dark green foliage that is often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months, followed by bright red berries that attract birds. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
