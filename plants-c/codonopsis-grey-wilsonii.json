    "intro": "Codonopsis grey-wilsonii, commonly known as the Grey-Wilson's bellflower, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or grassy habitats, and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, white pubescence, while its stems are slender and branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Codonopsis grey-wilsonii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
