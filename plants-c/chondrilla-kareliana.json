    "intro": "Chondrilla kareliana, commonly known as Karelian rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Europe and Western Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other economically important plants such as mustard and cabbage. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
