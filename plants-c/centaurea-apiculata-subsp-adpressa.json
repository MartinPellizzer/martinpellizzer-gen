    "intro": "Centaurea apiculata subsp. adpressa, commonly known as the slender centaury, is a flowering plant species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bright yellow flowers with a distinctive purple or red center. The plant typically thrives in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well adapted to Mediterranean climates. It is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
