    "intro": "Corryocactus ayacuchoensis var. leucacanthus, commonly known as the white-flowered ayacucho cactus, is a rare and striking species native to the Andean regions of Peru. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and clusters of white, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant has a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its leaves are reduced to spines, typical of many cacti, and it produces small, ribbed stems that store water. This variety is highly sought after by botanists and collectors due to its unique appearance and limited distribution."
