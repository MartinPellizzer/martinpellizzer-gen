    "intro": "Cataria canescens, commonly known as the white thornapple, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its spiny stems and showy white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
