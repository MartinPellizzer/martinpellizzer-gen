    "intro": "Cembra, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense white woolly coating, which helps protect it from harsh mountain climates. The plant typically grows at high altitudes where temperatures are low and conditions are extreme. Its flowers are small and star-shaped, usually blooming in late summer. Due to its rarity and beauty, the edelweiss is a symbol of alpine resilience and is protected in many regions."
