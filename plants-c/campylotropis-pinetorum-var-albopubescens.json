It features compound leaves with slender, alternate leaflets that are covered in a dense layer of white, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in axillary clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its hairy foliage and compact growth habit make it a distinctive member of the legume family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
