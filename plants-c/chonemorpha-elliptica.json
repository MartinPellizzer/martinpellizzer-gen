    "intro": "Chonemorpha elliptica, commonly known as the rock fig, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are elliptical in shape and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
