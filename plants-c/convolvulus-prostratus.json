    "intro": "Convolvulus prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate morning glory, is a low-growing annual herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, blooming in the morning. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields, and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
