    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 imandrensis, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Carex lyngbyei and Carex imandra, characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a tight, compact rosette. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing tiny, wind-pollinated seeds that contribute to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
