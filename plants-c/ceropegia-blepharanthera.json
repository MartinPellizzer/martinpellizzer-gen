It is characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces specialized structures called capitate glands, which are involved in attracting specific pollinators. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant."
