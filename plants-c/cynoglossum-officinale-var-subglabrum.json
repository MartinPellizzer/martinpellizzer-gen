    "intro": "Cynoglossum officinale var. subglabrum, commonly known as lesser mouse-ear, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, though the variety subglabrum has a smoother texture. The plant produces violet or blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves and flowers have been used historically in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
