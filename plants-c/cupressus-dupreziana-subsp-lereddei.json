    "intro": "Cupressus dupreziana subsp. lereddei, commonly known as the Leredde's lacebark cypress, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Madagascar. It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and its distinctive, peeling bark that reveals a fibrous, pale inner layer. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves arranged in dense, compact clusters along the branches. It flowers in the spring, producing inconspicuous, woody cones that contain wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, this subspecies is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance."
