    "intro": "Curcuma sahuynhensis, commonly known as the Suhunheng turmeric, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam. It belongs to the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces striking orange-yellow flowers during the warm season, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and the rhizomes are the primary part used for medicinal and culinary purposes. The botanical features of C. sahuynhensis make it an important species in both ecological and ethnobotanical contexts."
