    "intro": "Cerastium latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae). It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and it typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardy nature. Cerastium latifolium is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
