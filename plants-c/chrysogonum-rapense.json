It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. It has small, alternate leaves and produces seeds in a composite flower head. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
