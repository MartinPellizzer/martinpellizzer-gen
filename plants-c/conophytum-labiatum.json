    "intro": "Conophytum labiatum, commonly known as the \"Lip-shaped Namaqualand Cactus,\" is a succulent native to South Africa. It features a compact, rounded stem that often remains hidden beneath the soil, with fleshy, ribbed leaves that emerge during the rainy season. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. Conophytum labiatum is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
