    "intro": "Citrus cedra, commonly known as the sour orange. It is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, characterized by its fragrant, glossy leaves and clusters of small, orange-colored fruits. The fruit has a thick, leathery rind and a tart, acidic pulp, making it less suitable for fresh consumption but highly valued in cooking and traditional medicine. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are white and fragrant, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
