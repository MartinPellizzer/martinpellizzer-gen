    "intro": "Crocus vernus var. dorsalis, commonly known as the purple crocus, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from pale purple to deep violet, often with a distinctive darker throat. The plant typically blooms in early spring, making it one of the first flowers to appear after winter. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from the base of the plant. The bulbs are adapted to store nutrients, allowing the plant to survive dormant periods and regenerate each growing season."
