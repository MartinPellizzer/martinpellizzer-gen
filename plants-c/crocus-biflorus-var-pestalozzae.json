    "intro": "Crocus biflorus var. pestalozzae, commonly known as the Pestalozza's crocus, is a rare and ornamental bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features delicate, early spring blooms with pale yellow to cream-colored petals and a distinctive, nodding shape. The plant produces two to three flowers per stem, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a sought-after addition to rock gardens and alpine collections. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to preserve its genetic diversity."
