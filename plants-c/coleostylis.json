    "intro": "Coleostylis, commonly known as the \"buttercup orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often resemble those of the buttercup, with yellow petals and a prominent central spur. These plants are native to various regions in South America, particularly in Brazil and Peru, where they thrive in humid, shaded environments. Coleostylis species typically grow as terrestrial or epiphytic orchids, with rhizomes and pseudobulbs that help store moisture and nutrients. Their unique floral structure and ecological adaptations make them interesting subjects for botanical study."
