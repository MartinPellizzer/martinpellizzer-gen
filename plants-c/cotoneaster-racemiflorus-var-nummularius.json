    "intro": "Cotoneaster racemiflorus var. nummularius, commonly known as the silver cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and its distinctive foliage, which consists of small, shiny, silver-gray leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature. This variety is relatively low-maintenance and thrives in a variety of soil types once established."
