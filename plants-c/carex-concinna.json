    "intro": "Carex concinna, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. Native to North America, it thrives in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm and has small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland environments."
