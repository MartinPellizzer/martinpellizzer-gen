It is characterized by its yellowish-green foliage and produces small, yellow flowers in the summer. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in arid and semi-arid environments. It has a low-growing, shrub-like structure with dense, branching stems. The leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss."
