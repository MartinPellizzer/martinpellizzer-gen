    "intro": "Chaerophyllum siculum, commonly known as the Sicilian cow-wheat, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pinnately lobed leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in umbrella-like clusters. Native to southern Europe, particularly Sicily, it thrives in dry, rocky soils and sunny environments. The plant has a long flowering period, typically from spring to early summer, and is often found in Mediterranean regions. Its aromatic foliage and medicinal properties have made it of interest in traditional herbal practices."
