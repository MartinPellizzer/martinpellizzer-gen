    "intro": "Cassiope mertensiana subsp. californica, commonly known as the Sierra cushion plant, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of California. It features dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves that form a cushion-like structure, adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a characteristic species of the California coastal flora."
