    "intro": "Conium rugosum, commonly known as the rough hemlock, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant is notable for its strong, often unpleasant odor, which can be mistaken for poison hemlock. It is typically found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in gardens."
