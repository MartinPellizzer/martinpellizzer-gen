    "intro": "Cavendishia splachnoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its pale green, leaf-like structures and its striking, white, ghost-like flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires a specific balance of light and moisture. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
