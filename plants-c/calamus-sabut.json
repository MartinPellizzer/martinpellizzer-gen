    "intro": "Calamus sabut, commonly known as the fragrant cane or sweet flag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It belongs to the family Arecaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are typically green and glossy, with a pleasant, aromatic scent. Calamus sabut is known for its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies in waterlogged soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
