    "intro": "Carex lithophila, commonly known as the rock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and calcareous habitats. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in crevices or on rocky outcrops, where it forms dense, grass-like clumps. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Carex lithophila produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are characteristic of the sedge family."
