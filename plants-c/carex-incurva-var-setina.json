    "intro": "Carex incurva var. setina, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a sedge species native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The leaves are usually dark green and have a slightly rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
