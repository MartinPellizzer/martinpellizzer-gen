    "intro": "Carduus simplicifolius, commonly known as the common thistle, is a perennial herb native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and has a rosette of basal leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a rough, serrated edge, and the stems are covered in stiff, prickly bracts. The flowers are arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family, and are visited by various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
