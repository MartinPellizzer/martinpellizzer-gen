It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers, and is characterized by its toxic alkaloids. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or white, and it has hairy, ribbed stems and broad, ovate leaves. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is not recommended for cultivation in gardens or around livestock."
