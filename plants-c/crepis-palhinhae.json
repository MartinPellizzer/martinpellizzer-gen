    "intro": "Crepis palhinhae, commonly known as the Palhinha's mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by bristly, achene fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
