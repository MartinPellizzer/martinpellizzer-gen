It is a herbaceous annual plant native to North America, characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, alternate leaves. The plant produces tiny, yellowish-green flowers that give way to clustered, egg-shaped seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. This form is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Chenopodium ambrosioides."
