    "intro": "Cactus stueberi, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its globular shape and pale green to bluish-gray coloration, which helps it blend into its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to survive in hot, dry conditions with minimal water requirements. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and desert landscapes."
