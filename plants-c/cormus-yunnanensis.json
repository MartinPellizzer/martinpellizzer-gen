    "intro": "Cormus yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan corm, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its underground corm-like structures that serve as storage organs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the sedge family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
