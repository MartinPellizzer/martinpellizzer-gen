    "intro": "Callipsyche mirabilis, commonly known as the golden silk moth, is a species of moth belonging to the family Saturniidae. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow wings adorned with intricate patterns and iridescent markings. The larvae of this species are known for their large size and ability to consume significant amounts of foliage, often feeding on trees such as willow and poplar. The adult moths do not feed and are primarily active at night, emerging to mate and lay eggs. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, Callipsyche mirabilis is a subject of interest in both entomology and conservation efforts."
