    "intro": "Cufodontia, commonly known as the \"spiny coral tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and showy, often yellow or orange, flowers. The leaves are typically opposite and simple, with a rough texture, while the flowers are clustered in panicles. Cufodontia species are known for their spiny or thorn-like structures, which provide defense against herbivores. These plants are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained soils with adequate sunlight."
