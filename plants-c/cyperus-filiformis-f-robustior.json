    "intro": "Cyperus filiformis f. robustior, commonly known as the robust flat sedge, is a variant of the flat sedge species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and cylindrical inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands. The flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in late spring to early summer."
