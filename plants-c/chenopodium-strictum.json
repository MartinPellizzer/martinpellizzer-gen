    "intro": "Chenopodium strictum, commonly known as prickly goosefoot, is an annual herb native to North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are followed by hard, spiny fruits. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Chenopodium strictum is a common weed that can be identified by its distinctive, prickly texture and its ability to tolerate various environmental conditions."
