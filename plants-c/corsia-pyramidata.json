    "intro": "Corsia pyramidata, commonly known as the pyramid bellflower, is a striking plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The flowers are typically blue to violet in color, with a distinctive pyramid-like shape that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands. Corsia pyramidata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
