It is a cross between Carpodinus acutifolius and Ficus microcarpa, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, edible figs that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a hybrid species that showcases the adaptability and genetic diversity within the Moraceae family."
