It is characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has simple, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
