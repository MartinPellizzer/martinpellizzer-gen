It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, fleshy berries that provide food for wildlife. The plant has adapted to harsh desert conditions with deep root systems and thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its botanical features include opposite leaf arrangement and showy, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in desert ecosystems."
