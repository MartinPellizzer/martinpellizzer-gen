    "intro": "Cotoneaster pseudoobscurus, commonly known as the dark cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, sparsely branched structure and small, dark green leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, open woodlands. Cotoneaster pseudoobscurus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
