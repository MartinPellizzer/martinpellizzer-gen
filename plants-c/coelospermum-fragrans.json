    "intro": "Coelospermum fragrans, commonly known as the sweet-scented wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and fragrant, yellow-orange flowers that bloom throughout the warm seasons. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native habitats."
