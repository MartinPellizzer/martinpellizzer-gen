    "intro": "Colophospermum, commonly known as the African fire bush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, with some species extending into parts of Asia and the Pacific. The plants are shrubs or small trees, often characterized by their spiny stems and showy, often red or orange flowers. They have simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate or elliptical in shape. Colophospermum species are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making them resilient to drought conditions."
