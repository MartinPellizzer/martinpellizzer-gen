    "intro": "Cousinia neurocentra, commonly known as the narrowleaf cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, preferring arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, narrow leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Cousinia neurocentra is often found in alpine and subalpine zones, where it contributes to the local biodiversity."
