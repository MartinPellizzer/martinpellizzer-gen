    "intro": "Chamaecytisus banaticus var. subnudus, commonly known as the nakedleaf broom, is a shrub native to parts of southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are often reduced or nearly absent. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its unique foliage and ornamental flowers make it a desirable plant for horticultural use."
