    "intro": "Chamaecrista stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf burr pea, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant produces elongated, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Chamaecrista stricta is adapted to sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a common sight in coastal and dryland habitats."
