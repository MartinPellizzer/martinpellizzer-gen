It features erect, sparsely branched stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces bright blue to purple flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
