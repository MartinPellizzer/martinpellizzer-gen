    "intro": "Chrysothamnus bakeri, commonly known as Baker's goldenbush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow foliage, which is composed of narrow, linear leaves arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
