    "intro": "Castalia blanda, commonly known as the softleaf castalia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Castalia blanda thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its finely divided leaves and subtle floral display."
