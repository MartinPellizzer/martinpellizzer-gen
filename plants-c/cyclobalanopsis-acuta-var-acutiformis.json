    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis acuta var. acutiformis, commonly known as the sharp-toothed ironwood, is a variant of the cyclobalanopsis genus native to Southeast Asia. It is a large evergreen tree characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, spiny capsules containing dark brown seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland and hill forests. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is considered a valuable but threatened species in its native habitat."
