    "intro": "Chlorophytum colubrinum, commonly known as the snake plant, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped leaves that are typically green with distinct silver or white stripes. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and requires minimal water, making it an ideal indoor plant. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, which helps it store water and survive in arid environments. Chlorophytum colubrinum is also noted for its air-purifying properties, as it can absorb toxins from the air."
