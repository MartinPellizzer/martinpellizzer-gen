    "intro": "Caulotretus eriophorus, commonly known as the redcurrant eriophyid mite, is a microscopic acarid belonging to the family Eriophyidae. It is a plant-parasitic mite that primarily infests redcurrants (Ribes rubrum) and related species. The mite's body is elongated and covered in fine, waxy secretions, which help it adhere to plant surfaces. It feeds on plant sap, causing galls or deformities on leaves and stems. Due to its small size, it is often overlooked but can significantly impact the health and yield of cultivated redcurrant plants."
