    "intro": "Calamagrostis neglecta subsp. borealis, commonly known as the northern false panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or gray. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ornamental appeal and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
