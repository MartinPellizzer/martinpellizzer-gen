    "intro": "Craspedaria ovalis, commonly known as the oval flatworm, is a species of flatworm belonging to the phylum Platyhelminthes. It is characterized by its elongated, oval body shape and a smooth, slimy surface. This organism is typically found in freshwater environments, where it serves as a predator of small invertebrates. Craspedaria ovalis lacks a true circulatory system but possesses a simple excretory system for waste removal. Its life cycle involves free-living adults and parasitic larval stages, contributing to its ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
