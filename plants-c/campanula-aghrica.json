    "intro": "Campanula aghrica, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Campanula aghrica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
