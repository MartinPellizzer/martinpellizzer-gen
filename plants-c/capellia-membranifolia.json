    "intro": "Capellia membranifolia, commonly known as the membrane-leaf capellia, is a unique flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves that give it its common name, and its small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its botanical significance lies in its unusual leaf structure, which has made it a subject of interest in botanical research. Capellia membranifolia is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value and ecological importance."
