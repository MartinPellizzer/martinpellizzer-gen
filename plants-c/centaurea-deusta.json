    "intro": "Centaurea deusta, commonly known as the Spanish needle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and bright yellow to orange-red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces bristly, barbed seeds that are easily dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, with a slightly aromatic scent. Centaurea deusta is often found in dry grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
