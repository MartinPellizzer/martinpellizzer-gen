    "intro": "Cereus mariculi, commonly known as the Maricula cactus, is a species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of white flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening only for a few hours before closing. Cereus mariculi is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit."
