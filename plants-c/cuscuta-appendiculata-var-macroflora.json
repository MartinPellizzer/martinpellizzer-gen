    "intro": "Cuscuta appendiculata var. macroflora, commonly known as giant dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. The plant is native to various regions of the Americas and is often found growing on crops such as soybeans and corn. Its rapid growth and ability to spread quickly make it a significant agricultural pest. The varietal name \"macroflora\" refers to its relatively large flowers compared to other dodder species."
