It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the sedge family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its ability to tolerate wet conditions makes it an important component of riparian ecosystems."
