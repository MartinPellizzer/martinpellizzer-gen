    "intro": "Cheirinia hieraciifolia, commonly known as the hairy willow-herb, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, along riverbanks, and in woodland edges. The plant has slender, upright stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. The leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its overall ornamental value."
