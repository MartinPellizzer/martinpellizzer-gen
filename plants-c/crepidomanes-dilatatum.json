    "intro": "Crepidomanes dilatatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved sandwort, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. The plant is typically found in dry, sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. It has a low-growing habit and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Crepidomanes dilatatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
