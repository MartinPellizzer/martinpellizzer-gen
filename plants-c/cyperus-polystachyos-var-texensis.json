It features slender, grass-like stems with narrow, linear leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of flowers that are usually pale green or brown, which develop into three-sided, triangular seed capsules. It thrives in wet or seasonally flooded areas, making it a common species in wetlands and along waterways. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
