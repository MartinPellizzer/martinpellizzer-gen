    "intro": "Cordia opaca, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a small evergreen tree native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in brackish or saltwater marshes, playing a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important species for shoreline vegetation."
