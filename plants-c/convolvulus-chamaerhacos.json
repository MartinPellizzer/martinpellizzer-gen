    "intro": "Convolvulus chamaerhacos, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that produces showy, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and twining stems that allow it to climb or spread along the ground. Native to southern Europe and North Africa, it thrives in dry, rocky soils and full sun. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners, though it can be invasive in some regions."
