    "intro": "Colletia spinosissima, commonly known as the spiny colletia, is a succulent plant native to South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in sharp, spiny projections. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its rugged appearance. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique morphology and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
