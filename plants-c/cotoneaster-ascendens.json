    "intro": "Cotoneaster ascendens, commonly known as the ascending cotoneaster, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like China, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with dense, often thorny branches and small, elliptical leaves. It produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. Cotoneaster ascendens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature in temperate climates."
