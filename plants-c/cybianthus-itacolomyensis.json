    "intro": "Cybianthus itacolomyensis, commonly known as the Itacolomy endemic daisy, is a flowering plant native to the island of Itacolomy in the South Pacific. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, thriving in sandy soils and salt-laden environments. Its yellow-orange flowers bloom during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
