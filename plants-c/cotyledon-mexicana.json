    "intro": "Cotyledon mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican arrowleaf, is a succulent plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are capable of photosynthesis, allowing it to survive in arid environments with minimal water. Cotyledon mexicana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and resilience."
