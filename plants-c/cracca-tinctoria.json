It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and typically grows in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are alternate and often have a bluish-green hue. Cracca tinctoria is notable for its historical use in dyeing textiles due to the presence of pigments in its roots."
