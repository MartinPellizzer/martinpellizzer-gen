    "intro": "Corispermum stenolepis var. psilocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Its seeds are enclosed in small, capsule-like fruits and are dispersed by wind. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats."
