It is characterized by its basal rosette of elliptic, hairy leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are actinomorphic and have five petals, while the leaves are often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. Chrysosplenium macranthum is often found in the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in Europe and parts of Asia."
