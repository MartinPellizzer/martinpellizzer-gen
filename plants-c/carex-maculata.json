    "intro": "Carex maculata, commonly known as the spotted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves that are often tinged with purple or brown spots. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown, arranged in spikelets. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, bogs, and along stream banks. Carex maculata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
