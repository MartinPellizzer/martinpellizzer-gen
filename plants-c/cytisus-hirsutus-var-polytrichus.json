    "intro": "Cytisus hirsutus var. polytrichus, commonly known as the hairy broom, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are trifoliate, with three small, hairy leaflets that give the plant its common name. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and woodland edges. This variety is closely related to other cytisus species and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
