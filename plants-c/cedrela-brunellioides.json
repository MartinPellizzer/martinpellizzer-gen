    "intro": "Cedrela brunellioides, commonly known as Brazilian cedar or Brazilian mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves and fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The tree produces woody, oval-shaped fruits that contain flat, winged seeds. Its timber is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, though overharvesting has led to conservation concerns. Cedrela brunellioides plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
