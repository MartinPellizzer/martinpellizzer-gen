    "intro": "Clerodendrum paucidentatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flame bush, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It features opposite, lanceolate leaves that are usually dark green and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color, which attract pollinators like birds and insects. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
