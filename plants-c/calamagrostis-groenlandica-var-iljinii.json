    "intro": "Calamagrostis groenlandica var. iljinii, commonly known as the Greenland sedge, is a perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its tall, slender culms and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
