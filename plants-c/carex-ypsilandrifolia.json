It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and wet meadows.
