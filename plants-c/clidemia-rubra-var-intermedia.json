    "intro": "Clidemia rubra var. intermedia, commonly known as the Hawaiian stiltgrass, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and showy, pink to red flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. It has a creeping growth habit with runners that can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in Hawaii and poses a threat to native ecosystems."
