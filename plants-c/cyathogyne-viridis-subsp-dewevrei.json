    "intro": "Cyathogyne viridis subsp. dewevrei, commonly known as the green cyathogyne, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and often showy inflorescences. The subspecies is distinguished by its vibrant green foliage and unique floral structure, which includes a cup-like involucre surrounding the flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in cloud forests or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
