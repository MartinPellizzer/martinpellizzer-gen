It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a shallow root system that allows it to absorb moisture efficiently. It blooms at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its unique flowering pattern and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens in dry climates."
