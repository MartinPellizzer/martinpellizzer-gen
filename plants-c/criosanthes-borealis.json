    "intro": "Criosanthes borealis, commonly known as the Arctic Moonflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high Arctic regions. It belongs to the orchid family and is characterized by its pale, luminescent blooms that open only under specific light conditions. The plant has adapted to extreme cold by developing a thick, insulating layer of frost-resistant tissue. Its flowers emit a faint bioluminescent glow, aiding in pollination by nocturnal insects. Due to its fragile nature, it is highly sensitive to climate change and habitat disruption."
