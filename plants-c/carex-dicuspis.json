    "intro": "Carex dicuspis, commonly known as the two-spined sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, cylindrical leaves and small, clustered flowering heads. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along streambanks. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively. Carex dicuspis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
