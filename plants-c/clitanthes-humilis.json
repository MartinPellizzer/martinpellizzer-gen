    "intro": "Clitanthes humilis, commonly known as the common evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring hairy stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting pollinators such as moths and beetles. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Clitanthes humilis is often found in disturbed habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
