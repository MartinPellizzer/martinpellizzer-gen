    "intro": "Chaenocephalus pallatangensis, commonly known as the Tibetan sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is a member of the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant features small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water in arid environments. It produces tiny, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
