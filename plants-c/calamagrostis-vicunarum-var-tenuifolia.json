    "intro": "Calamagrostis vicunarum var. tenuifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf bluegrass, is a grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant forms dense clumps and produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
