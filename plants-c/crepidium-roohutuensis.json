It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its small, clustered flowers are pollinated by insects, and it plays a significant role in the local ecosystem. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
