    "intro": "Cheilanthes micropteris, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Cheilanthes micropteris is often found growing on limestone or sandstone outcrops, making it a common sight in desert environments."
