    "intro": "Chilopsis saligna, commonly known as the desert willow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it has a distinctive willow-like appearance. Chilopsis saligna is adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
