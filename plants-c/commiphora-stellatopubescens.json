    "intro": "Commiphora stellatopubescens, commonly known as the star-haired myrrh tree, is a small, deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a resinous sap, which has been used traditionally for its aromatic and medicinal properties. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
