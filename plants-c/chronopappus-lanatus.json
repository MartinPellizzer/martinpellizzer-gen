It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green foliage and bright yellow ray flowers. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that are adapted for long-distance travel. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open grasslands. Its botanical features make it well-suited for drought conditions and ecological restoration projects."
