    "intro": "Colchicum cupanii var. parviflorum, commonly known as the dwarf autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It produces striking violet-blue flowers in the autumn, typically from September to November, which bloom on short, leafless stems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous corm, typical of the Colchicaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
