    "intro": "Cosmos sessilis var. stellatus, commonly known as the star cosmos, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or purple. The leaves are typically gray-green and have a fuzzy texture, while the stems are covered in fine hairs. This variety is well-suited for dry climates and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate blooms and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
