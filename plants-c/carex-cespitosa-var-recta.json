    "intro": "Carex cespitosa var. recta, commonly known as the upright sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to North America. It features grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly pointed, with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces dense, upright clusters of spikelets, which are its flowering structures. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for wetland gardens and ecological restoration projects."
