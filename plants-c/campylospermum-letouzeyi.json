    "intro": "Campylospermum letouzeyi, commonly known as the silky camphor tree, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves that emit a camphor-like scent. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often visited by various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the wild. Due to its unique botanical features and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
