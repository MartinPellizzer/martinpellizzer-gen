    "intro": "Comanthera xeranthemoides var. strigillosa, commonly known as the hairy sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with hairy stems and leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
