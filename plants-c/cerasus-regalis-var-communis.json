    "intro": "Cerasus regalis var. communis, commonly known as the Japanese cherry, is a species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The tree produces small, sweet fruits that are edible but not as commonly consumed as other cherry varieties. It is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its beautiful blossoms. The plant thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
