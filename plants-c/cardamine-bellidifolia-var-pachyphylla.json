    "intro": "Cardamine bellidifolia var. pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved watercress, is a variant of the watercress species native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, fleshy leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, enhancing its ornamental value. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor similar to other watercress varieties. This variant is often found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and marshy areas where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
