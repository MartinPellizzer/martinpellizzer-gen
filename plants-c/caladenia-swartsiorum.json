    "intro": "Caladenia swartsiorum, commonly known as the Swart's Spider-orchid, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive spider-like appearance. The plant produces a single, slender stem that bears a single, showy orchid flower with a dark, hooded labellum. It typically blooms during the cooler months, from June to August, and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
