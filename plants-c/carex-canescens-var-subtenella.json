    "intro": "Carex canescens var. subtenella, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a variant of the common hairgrass species native to North America. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, wind-pollinated flowers. The leaves are usually shorter and more slender compared to the typical variety, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
