    "intro": "Carex divaricata, commonly known as the slender sedges, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil in wetland areas. Carex divaricata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
