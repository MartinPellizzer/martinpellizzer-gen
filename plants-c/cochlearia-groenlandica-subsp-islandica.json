It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy, basal leaves and small, yellowish flowers arranged in a single umbel. The plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is part of the Brassicaceae family. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
