    "intro": "Caladenia echidnachila, commonly known as the echidna-horned orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Western Australia. It features a slender, wiry stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf that is often covered in a fine layer of white to grey pubescence. The flower spike produces one or two striking, pale yellow to cream-colored flowers with a distinctive, elongated labellum. It blooms during late spring to early summer, typically between September and November. This species is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
