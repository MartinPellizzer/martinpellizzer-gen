    "intro": "Cereus queretaroensis, commonly known as the Mexican torch cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its tall, spiny stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it retain water in its harsh desert environment. Its roots are shallow and adapted to quickly absorb moisture after rare rainfalls. Cereus queretaroensis is often cultivated for its striking appearance and resilience in drought conditions."
