    "intro": "Cavalcantia glomerata, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Cavalcantia glomerata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
