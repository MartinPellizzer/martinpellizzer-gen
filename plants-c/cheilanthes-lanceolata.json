    "intro": "Cheilanthes lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf rock fern, is a perennial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. This plant is adapted to thrive in rocky soils and can often be found growing on cliffs or in crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor firmly in its harsh environment. The plant is drought-tolerant and can survive prolonged periods without rainfall."
