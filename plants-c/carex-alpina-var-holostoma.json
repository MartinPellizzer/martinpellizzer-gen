    "intro": "Carex alpina var. holostoma, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and subalpine regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous environments where it thrives in cold, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. This variety is notable for its hardiness and ability to colonize disturbed or barren alpine sites."
