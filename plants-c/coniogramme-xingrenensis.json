    "intro": "Coniogramme xingrenensis, commonly known as the Xingrenensis Coniogramme, is a rare and ornamental plant native to China. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are followed by berries that mature to a bright red color. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and botanical collections. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
