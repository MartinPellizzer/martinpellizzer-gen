    "intro": "Crosperma, commonly known as the false hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and the Americas. The plants typically have palmate leaves and produce showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. They are often found in moist, well-drained soils and can thrive in a variety of light conditions. Crosperma species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
