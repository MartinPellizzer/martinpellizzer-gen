    "intro": "Combretum pilosum var. spinescens, commonly known as the spiny combretum, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in short, stiff spines, which provide a defensive mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its overall textured appearance. This species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystems."
