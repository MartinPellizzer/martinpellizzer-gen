    "intro": "Chrysanthemum budjnurdense, commonly known as the Siberian chrysanthemum, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Central Asia. It features a robust root system and upright, hairy stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces daisy-like flowers with yellow disc florets and white to pale pink ray florets, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses in its native regions."
