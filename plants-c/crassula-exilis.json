    "intro": "Crassula exilis, commonly known as the Little Crassula or Baby Crassula, is a small, succulent plant native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of fleshy, rounded leaves that are typically green with a slight reddish tinge under bright light. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves to survive dry periods. Crassula exilis is often grown as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance."
