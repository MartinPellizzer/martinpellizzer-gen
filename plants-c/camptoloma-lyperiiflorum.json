It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive lyre-shaped leaves. The plant produces bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
