    "intro": "Carex muricata subsp. cesanensis, commonly known as the rough\u7a57 sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, usually green or brown flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, often shaded environments such as wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and is often found in association with other wetland vegetation. The subspecies cesanensis is distinguished by its more robust growth and slightly roughened leaf surfaces compared to the typical form of Carex muricata."
