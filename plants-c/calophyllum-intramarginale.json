    "intro": "Calophyllum intramarginale, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, orange-red fruits containing numerous seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its rich color and durability, though it is now protected due to overharvesting. The plant also has medicinal uses in traditional medicine, particularly for its anti-inflammatory properties."
