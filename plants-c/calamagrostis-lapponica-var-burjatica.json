    "intro": "Calamagrostis lapponica var. burjatica, commonly known as the Burjat tusslegrass, is a perennial grass native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in cold, moist environments such as tundra and wet meadows, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are usually pale green to reddish in color. Calamagrostis lapponica var. burjatica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small arctic fauna."
