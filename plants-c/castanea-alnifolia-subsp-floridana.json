    "intro": "Castanea alnifolia subsp. floridana, commonly known as the Florida chestnut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces small, spiny capsules that contain one or two edible nuts, which are enclosed in a thick, scaly husk. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along riverbanks. Due to habitat loss and disease, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
