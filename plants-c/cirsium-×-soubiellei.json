    "intro": "Cirsium \u00d7 soubiellei, commonly known as the hybrid thistle, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Cirsium arvense (creeping thistle) and Cirsium vulgare (common thistle). The plant is characterized by its spiny, lance-shaped leaves and purple to pink flower heads that bloom in late summer. It is typically found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and meadows. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
