    "intro": "Chaenotheca neopeltandra, commonly known as the New Zealand cup lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish thallus with distinct, cup-like lobes. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides it with nutrients through photosynthesis. It is typically found on tree bark and soil in temperate regions of New Zealand. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
