It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features slender, vine-like stems that can climb or trail along the ground. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, producing a mild milky sap that is characteristic of the Asclepiadaceae family."
