    "intro": "Cotoneaster vandelaarii, commonly known as the Mascarene cotoneaster, is a shrub native to the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, orange-red berries that appear in the winter. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and rocky habitats, showing a degree of salt tolerance. Its leaves are elliptical with a leathery texture, and it produces white flowers in clusters during the summer months. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its island environment."
