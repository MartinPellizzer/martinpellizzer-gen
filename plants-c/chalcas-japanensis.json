    "intro": "Chalcas japanensis, commonly known as the Japanese chalcis, is a rare flowering plant native to Japan. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
