    "intro": "Citrullus colocynthis var. bipinnatifidus, commonly known as the prickly cucumber or Egyptian cucumber, is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and yellow-orange flowers that develop into rough, warty fruits. The plant is native to arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Europe. Its fruit contains a toxic, bitter pulp and is used in traditional medicine for its purported laxative properties. Due to its sharp spines and toxic characteristics, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
