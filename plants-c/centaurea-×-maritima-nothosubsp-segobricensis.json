    "intro": "Centaurea \u00d7 maritima nothosubsp. segobricensis, commonly known as the Segobric coast thistle, is a hybrid plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and blue to purple flowering heads, which are surrounded by pale yellow ray florets. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to saline and coastal environments. It produces small, spiny bracts that protect its composite flowers, which are composed of numerous tiny florets. This nothosubspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its hybrid origin and ecological adaptations."
