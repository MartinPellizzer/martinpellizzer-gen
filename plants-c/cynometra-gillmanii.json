    "intro": "Cynometra gillmanii, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and elongated, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood used in traditional crafts and construction. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
