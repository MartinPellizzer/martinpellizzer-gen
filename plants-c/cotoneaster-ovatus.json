    "intro": "Cotoneaster ovatus, commonly known as the Japanese cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Cotoneaster ovatus is also known for its relatively slow growth rate and hardy nature."
