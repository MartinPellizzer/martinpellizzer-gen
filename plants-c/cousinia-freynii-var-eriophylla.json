It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small brushes. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of pink to purple, are arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. Cousinia freynii var. eriophylla typically grows from 10 to 30 centimeters tall, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
