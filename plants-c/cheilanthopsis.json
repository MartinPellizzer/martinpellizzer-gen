These plants are characterized by their leathery, often sparsely hairy leaves and are typically found in rocky or calcareous soils. Cheilanthopsis species are known for their distinctive, often recurved fronds and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. They are primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, with a notable presence in Central and South America. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their unique foliage."
