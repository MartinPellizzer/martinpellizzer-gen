    "intro": "Calea anomala, commonly known as the \"flower of the night,\" is a striking tropical plant native to Mexico and Central America. It features showy, violet-blue flowers that open at night and close by dawn, a characteristic that gives it its common name. The plant has a rosette of narrow, silvery-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reflect light and retain moisture. Its unique blooming pattern makes it a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture. Calea anomala is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
