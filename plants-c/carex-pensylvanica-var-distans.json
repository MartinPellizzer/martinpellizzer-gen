    "intro": "Carex pensylvanica var. distans, commonly known as the Pennsylvania sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered spikelets that bear both male and female flowers. This variety is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. The plant is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in garden settings."
