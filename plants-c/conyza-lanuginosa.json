    "intro": "Conyza lanuginosa, commonly known as the downy conyza, is an annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions. Conyza lanuginosa is also known for its ability to spread through wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its widespread distribution."
