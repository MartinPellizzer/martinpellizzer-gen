    "intro": "Coryphantha bisbeeana, commonly known as the Bisbee cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces showy yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
