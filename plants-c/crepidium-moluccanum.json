    "intro": "Crepidium moluccanum, commonly known as the Moluccan orchid, is a species native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a short, upright stem with several leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the surrounding soil, which is typical for many orchid species. The flower structure includes three sepals and three petals, with the latter often being modified into a labellum, which plays a role in pollination."
