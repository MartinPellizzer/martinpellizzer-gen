    "intro": "Carelia litorale, commonly known as the coastal carelia, is a hardy plant adapted to thrive in coastal environments. It possesses succulent leaves that help retain moisture in sandy or saline soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in unstable coastal substrates. Carelia litorale is often found in dune ecosystems, playing a vital role in preventing erosion."
