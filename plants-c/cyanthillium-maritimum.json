It is characterized by its low-growing, herbaceous structure with hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to saline environments. Cyanthillium maritimum plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
