    "intro": "Cirsium \u00d7 spinifolium, commonly known as the rough thistle, is a hybrid plant species belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it has been introduced to other regions, often becoming invasive due to its rapid growth and adaptability. The plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. Its robust structure and defensive spines help it deter herbivores, contributing to its survival in competitive environments."
