    "intro": "Catasetum fimbriatum var. micranthum, commonly known as the narrow-flowered catasetum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, lance-shaped flowers with a distinctive yellowish-green coloration. The plant typically blooms during the summer months, and its flowers are known for their unique structure, including specialized pollination mechanisms. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a suitable choice for greenhouse or indoor cultivation. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively ease of care compared to other catasetum species."
