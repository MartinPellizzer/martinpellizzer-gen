    "intro": "Centaurium laxiflorum f. album, commonly known as the white-flowered centaury, is a rare and striking variant of the centaury plant. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its pale white to cream-colored flowers, which contrast with its dark green foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in mountainous regions, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers are tubular and arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
