    "intro": "Ctenitis interjecta, commonly known as the crested fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, layered fronds that give it a unique, almost sculptural appearance. The plant has a tall, unbranched trunk that is covered in a fibrous, spongy material called the rachis. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a soft blue glow at night, which helps attract pollinators. This rare and visually striking plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
