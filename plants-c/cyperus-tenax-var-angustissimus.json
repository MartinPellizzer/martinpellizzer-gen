    "intro": "Cyperus tenax var. angustissimus, commonly known as narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to saturated soils. The plant has slender, triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are often arranged in a compact, tussock-like form. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, which are usually borne in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats."
