    "intro": "Cleome dendroidea, commonly known as the tree cleome, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its woody stems that resemble small trees or shrubs, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, yellow, and white, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, often with a slightly hairy texture. Cleome dendroidea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
