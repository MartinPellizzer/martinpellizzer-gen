    "intro": "Cajum pinnatum, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pink in color, followed by red, fleshy berries. Cajum pinnatum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and wetlands. It is also known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, making it an invasive species in some regions."
