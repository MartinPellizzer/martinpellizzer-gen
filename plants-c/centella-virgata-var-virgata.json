    "intro": "Centella virgata var. virgata, commonly known as the small centella or slender centella, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is a low-growing herbaceous perennial characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of small white or pinkish flowers. Native to parts of Africa and Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a creeping stem that often forms dense mats, and its leaves are typically rounded with a slightly waxy texture. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
