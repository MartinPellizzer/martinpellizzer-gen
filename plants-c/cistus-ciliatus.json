    "intro": "Cistus ciliatus, commonly known as the woolly rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silver-green, hairy foliage and showy pink or reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for Mediterranean climates. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss, a feature common in xerophytic plants. The flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological importance in its native habitat."
