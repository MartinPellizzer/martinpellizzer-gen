    "intro": "Carduus pectinatus, commonly known as the Italian thistle or woolly thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and large, showy purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces a capsule containing numerous small, fluffy seeds that are easily dispersed by the wind. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its botanical features make it both a distinctive ornamental plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
