    "intro": "Cerastium gibraltaricum var. lanuginosum, commonly known as the Gibraltar hairsedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which give it its varietal name \"lanuginosum,\" meaning \"woolly\" in Latin. It thrives in rocky, limestone soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. This species is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
