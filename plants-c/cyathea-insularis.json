    "intro": "Cyathea insularis, commonly known as the island tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of the Indo-Pacific. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in coastal forests and mountainous areas. Its rhizome system supports the growth of its massive fronds, which can reach several meters in length. Cyathea insularis plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
