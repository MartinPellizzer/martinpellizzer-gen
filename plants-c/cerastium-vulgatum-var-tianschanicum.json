    "intro": "Cerastium vulgatum var. tianschanicum, commonly known as the Tianshan mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, rounded leaves and clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
