    "intro": "Crocus cyprius, commonly known as the Cyprus crocus, is a species of flowering plant in the genus Crocus. It is native to the island of Cyprus and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a single, showy bloom with six petals and a central cluster of stamens. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. The bulbs of Crocus cyprius are also used in the production of saffron, though the yield is lower compared to other Crocus species."
