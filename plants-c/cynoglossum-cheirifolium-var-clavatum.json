    "intro": "Cynoglossum cheirifolium var. clavatum, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and branched. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
