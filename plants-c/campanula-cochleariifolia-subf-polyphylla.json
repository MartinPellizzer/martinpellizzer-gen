    "intro": "Campanula cochleariifolia subf. polyphylla, commonly known as the many-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, lance-shaped leaves and tall, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
