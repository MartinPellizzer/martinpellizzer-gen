    "intro": "Cactus minimus, commonly known as the dwarf cactus, is a small, spiny plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and short, cylindrical stems. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and protecting it from herbivores. Cactus minimus is well adapted to harsh desert environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
