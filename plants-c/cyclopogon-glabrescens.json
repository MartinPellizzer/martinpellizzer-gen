    "intro": "Cyclopogon glabrescens, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cyclopogon, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its slender, unbranched stem. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers, followed by dark blue, fleshy berries. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
