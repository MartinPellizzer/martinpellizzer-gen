    "intro": "Carex hornschuchiana subsp. subsalsa, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It has narrow, grassy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in alpine ecosystems."
