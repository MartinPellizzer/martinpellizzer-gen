    "intro": "Carex planilamina, commonly known as the broad-leaf sedges, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Carex planilamina is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse ecosystems."
