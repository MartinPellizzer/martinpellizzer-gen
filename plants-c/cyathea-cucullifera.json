    "intro": "Cyathea cucullifera, commonly known as the hooded tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are typically bright green and have a distinctive, almost hood-like shape at the base. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its unique morphology makes it a popular specimen in botanical gardens and a subject of interest in plant taxonomy."
