    "intro": "Cyperus derreilema var. brevispiculosus, commonly known as the narrow-bracted flatsedge, is a grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along water edges. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, three-ranked flowers, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is distinguished by its short, bristly spikes and is often found in low-lying areas with poor drainage."
