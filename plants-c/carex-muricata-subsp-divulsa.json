    "intro": "Carex muricata subsp. divulsa, commonly known as the broad-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its robust, grass-like leaves that are typically broader than those of other Carex species. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually green or brown in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
