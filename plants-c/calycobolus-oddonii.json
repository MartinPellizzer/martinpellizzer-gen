    "intro": "Calycobolus oddonii, commonly known as the oddon's calycobolus, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodlands or along stream banks. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant diversity. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in its native range."
