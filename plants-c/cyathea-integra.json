    "intro": "Cyathea integra, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive crown of overlapping, compound leaves that give it a lush, tropical appearance. Cyathea integra thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a popular ornamental plant in tropical gardens."
