    "intro": "Chrysocalyx rubiginosa, commonly known as the red-stained bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to deep red, depending on the variety. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with a reddish hue, contributing to its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in its natural habitat."
