    "intro": "Carex pilulifera f. fallax, commonly known as the fallax form of slender sedge, is a variant of the slender sedge species native to North America. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and a dense cluster of flowering spikes. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its botanical features include small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This form is distinguished by its slightly different growth habits and morphology compared to the typical form of Carex pilulifera."
