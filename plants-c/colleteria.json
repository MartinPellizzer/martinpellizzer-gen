    "intro": "Colleteria, commonly known as the golden cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Bolivia, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spines and its showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring. Colleteria species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their striking appearance and resilience to drought. They play an important role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various desert animals."
