It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a hairy texture. Convolvulus nemorosus is often found in woodland areas, along paths, and in disturbed soils, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
