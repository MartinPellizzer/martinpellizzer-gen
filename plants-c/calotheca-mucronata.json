    "intro": "Calotheca mucronata, commonly known as the narrow-tipped rockmoss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its small, leafy structure and is typically found growing on damp, rocky surfaces in shaded environments. The plant has a thalloid body that is dorsiventral, with a distinct upper and lower surface. Its reproductive structures, including archegonia and antheridia, are located on the lower surface of the thallus. Calotheca mucronata is often used in ecological studies to assess the health of moist, undisturbed habitats."
