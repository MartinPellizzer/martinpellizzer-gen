    "intro": "Cinchona condaminea, commonly known as the yellow quinine tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces bright red, ornamental berries that are a key feature of its botanical appearance. It is closely related to other cinchona species, which are historically known for their medicinal properties, particularly the production of quinine. However, unlike some related species, Cinchona condaminea is not primarily cultivated for its medicinal alkaloids."
