    "intro": "Cupressus arizonica, commonly known as the Arizona cypress, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, columnar form and scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, and it has a deep root system that helps it thrive in arid environments. It is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance. The Arizona cypress plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
