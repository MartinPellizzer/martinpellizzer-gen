It consists of a single species, Cryptopetalum sinuatum, which is native to the eastern United States. The plant is characterized by its unique, clustered inflorescences and showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Cryptopetalum is often found in moist, wooded areas and is notable for its ephemeral blooming period."
