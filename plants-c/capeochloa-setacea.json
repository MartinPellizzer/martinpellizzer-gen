    "intro": "Capeochloa setacea, commonly known as the Cape feather grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas. Capeochloa setacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its delicate, feathery appearance."
