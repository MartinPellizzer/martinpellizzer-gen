    "intro": "Chamaecrista cotinifolia var. cotinifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian strangle vine, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its showy, yellow-orange floral clusters. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
