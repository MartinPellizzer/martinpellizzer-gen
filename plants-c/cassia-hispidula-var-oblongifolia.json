    "intro": "Cassia hispidula var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the hairy cassia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, glandular hairs that give it a rough texture. The plant produces bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are encased in slender, pod-like fruits that split open when mature. Cassia hispidula var. oblongifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
