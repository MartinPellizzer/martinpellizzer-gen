    "intro": "Caturus ramiflorus, commonly known as the branching flower plant, is a perennial herb native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that bear clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its unique floral structure makes it a subject of interest in both horticultural and botanical studies."
