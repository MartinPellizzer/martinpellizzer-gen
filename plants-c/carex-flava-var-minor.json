    "intro": "Carex flava var. minor, commonly known as the lesser yellow sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often yellow-green in color, and it produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow flowers in the summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread gradually, forming dense mats. The species is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
