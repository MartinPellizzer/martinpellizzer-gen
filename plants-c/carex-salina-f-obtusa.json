    "intro": "Carex salina f. obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaved salt marsh sedge, is a variant of the salt marsh sedge native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to tolerate saline and brackish environments. This plant thrives in wetlands, estuaries, and tidal flats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms. Its inflorescence consists of a single spike of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. The plant is an important component of coastal ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and ecological balance in saline habitats."
