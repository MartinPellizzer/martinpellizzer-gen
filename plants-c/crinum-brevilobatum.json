It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in summer. The plant features strap-like, narrow leaves that are usually arranged in a basal rosette. It produces a tall, leafy stem that bears clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. Crinum brevilobatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
