    "intro": "Caroxylon adversariifolium, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. It is often found growing in rocky soils and along canyon walls. Its ability to thrive in extreme conditions makes it an important species for stabilizing desert ecosystems."
