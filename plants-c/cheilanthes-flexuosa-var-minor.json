    "intro": "Cheilanthes flexuosa var. minor, commonly known as the small-leaf rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and small, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its succulent-like leaves. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups. This variety is often found in crevices and on rock faces, where it forms dense, resilient colonies."
