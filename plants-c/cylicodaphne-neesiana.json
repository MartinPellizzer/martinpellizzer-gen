    "intro": "Cylicodaphne neesiana, commonly known as the dwarf sago palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and pinnately compound leaves that give it a palm-like appearance. The plant features a short, stout trunk covered with a fibrous, spongy layer called a cortex. Its leaves are typically bright green and can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. Cylicodaphne neesiana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
