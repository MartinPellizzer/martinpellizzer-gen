It features upright stems that bear clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple. The leaves are typically narrow and sessile, giving the plant its specific epithet. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. The plant is valued in gardens for its ornamental flowers and is relatively low maintenance once established."
