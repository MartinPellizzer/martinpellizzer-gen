    "intro": "Cacalia clematites, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe. It features a low-growing habit with slender stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stems, and the plant thrives in moist, shady environments. Cacalia clematites is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
