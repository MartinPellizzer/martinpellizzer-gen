    "intro": "Cyrtopodium buchtienii, commonly known as the Buchtien's corydalis, is a rare orchid species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers with a distinctive pinkish-purple hue. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, thriving in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is known for its ornamental value in horticulture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
