    "intro": "Ceropegia awdeliana, commonly known as the Desert Trumpet, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa. It features fleshy, tubular stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish-white. Its leaves are small, waxy, and often clustered at the base of the stems. Ceropegia awdeliana thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
