    "intro": "Cyathula officinalis, commonly known as the common spurge, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and distinctive cyathium inflorescence. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, while the flowers are small and clustered in cup-like structures. Cyathula officinalis has been used historically in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
