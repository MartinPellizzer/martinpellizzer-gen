    "intro": "Ceterach cordatum var. namaquense, commonly known as the Namakwa daisy, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically fleshy and covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and rock gardens."
