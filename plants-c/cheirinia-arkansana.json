It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and prairies. It produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
