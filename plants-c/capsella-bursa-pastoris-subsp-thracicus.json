    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris subsp. thracicus, commonly known as the Thrace velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly larger leaves and more robust growth compared to the typical *C. bursa-pastoris*. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found along roadsides and in meadows. The plant has a taproot system and produces seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its wide distribution."
