    "intro": "Capanemia superflua, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of northern Australia. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant produces striking white or pale blue flowers with a unique, orchid-like appearance. Its leaves are elongated and strap-shaped, often covered in a thin, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a vulnerable species."
