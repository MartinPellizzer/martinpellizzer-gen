It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and palmate leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by distinctive pod-like fruits. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Crotalaria decaulescens is often found in disturbed soils and can be an invasive species in certain areas."
