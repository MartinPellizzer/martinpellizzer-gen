It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, often thorned stems and narrow, trifoliate leaves that are typically gray-green in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
