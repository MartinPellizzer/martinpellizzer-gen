    "intro": "Commersonia craurophylla, commonly known as the coastal daisy, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, daisy-like white flowers that bloom in spring and summer. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it is drought-tolerant. Commersonia craurophylla plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
