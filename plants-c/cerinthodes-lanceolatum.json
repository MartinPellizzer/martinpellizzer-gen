    "intro": "Cerinthodes lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cerinthodes, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
