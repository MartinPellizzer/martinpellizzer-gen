    "intro": "Crotalaria macaulayae, commonly known as the Macaulay's spurred cowpea, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven leaflets and produces distinctive spurred flowers in shades of yellow or orange. Crotalaria macaulayae is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands. It is also known for its potential use in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from the soil."
