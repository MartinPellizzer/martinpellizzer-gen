    "intro": "Cordia digynia, commonly known as the two-seed tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by fleshy, red berries containing two seeds, hence its common name. It is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
