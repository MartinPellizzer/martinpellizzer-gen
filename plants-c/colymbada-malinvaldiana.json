    "intro": "Colymbada malinvaldiana, commonly known as the Malinvaldian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking bell-shaped flowers that range in color from violet to blue, typically blooming in late spring. The plant has lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
