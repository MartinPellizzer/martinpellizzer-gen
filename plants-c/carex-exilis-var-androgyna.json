    "intro": "Carex exilis var. androgyna, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a variant of the slender sedge species native to wetland environments. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, which are usually inconspicuous and clustered in dense spikes. The variety androgyna is distinguished by its andromonoecious nature, meaning it has both male and female flowers on the same plant."
