    "intro": "Carex dioica f. sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered yellow sedge, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of pale yellow to brownish flowers, which are often more sparsely arranged compared to other Carex species. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
