    "intro": "Corallorhiza micrantha, commonly known as the small-petaled coralroot, is a root-parasitic orchid that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients. It is native to eastern North America and is typically found in shaded, moist forest environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its lack of leaves and green pigmentation makes it unique among orchids, as it cannot perform photosynthesis. Corallorhiza micrantha is often associated with hardwood trees such as oaks and maples, which serve as its primary hosts."
