    "intro": "Cyathea calocoma, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, compound fronds. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, a unique trait that sets it apart from many other ferns. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation."
