    "intro": "Ceratonia oreothauma subsp. somalensis, commonly known as the Somali carob tree, is a subspecies native to the Horn of Africa, particularly Somalia. It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces pods containing edible seeds, similar to other members of the Caesalpiniaceae family. Its leaves are bipinnate, and the tree has a deep root system adapted to drought conditions. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
