    "intro": "Cousinia lachnosphaera var. lachnosphaera, commonly known as the woolly cinquefoil, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are often covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
