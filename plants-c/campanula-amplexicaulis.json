    "intro": "Campanula amplexicaulis, commonly known as the clasping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically blue to violet in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are basal and clasping, forming a rosette at the base of the plant, while the upper leaves are opposite and lance-shaped. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
