    "intro": "Clara stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed evergreen, is a hardy shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features narrow, dark green leaves that are densely packed along its upright stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Its compact growth habit and evergreen foliage make it an attractive addition to gardens in mild climates."
