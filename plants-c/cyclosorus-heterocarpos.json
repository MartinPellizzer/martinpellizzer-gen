    "intro": "Cyclosorus heterocarpos, commonly known as the heterocarpous cyclosorus, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and small, clustered fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its spores are dispersed through the water, contributing to its reproductive strategy in aquatic environments. The leaves are usually dark green and have a distinctive, narrow shape with a serrated margin."
