It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in countries like Mexico and Guatemala. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
