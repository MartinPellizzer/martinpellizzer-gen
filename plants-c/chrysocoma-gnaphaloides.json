It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs that give it a distinctive appearance and help reduce water loss. Chrysocoma gnaphaloides is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
