    "intro": "Cissampelos owariensis var. asperifolia, commonly known as the rough-leaved cissampelos, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a rough, textured surface that gives it its varietal name. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks."
