It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a single night, and are pollinated by nocturnal insects. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and unique blooming habit."
