It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in three rows, giving it a distinct appearance. Its flowering spikes are usually slender and contain small, greenish-brown flowers. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
