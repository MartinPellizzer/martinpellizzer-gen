    "intro": "Cuscuta neuropetala var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is typically found in coastal areas, where it attaches to a variety of host plants, including grasses and shrubs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its hosts. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas along shorelines. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants."
