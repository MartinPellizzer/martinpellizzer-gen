It is characterized by its thin, woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are followed by yellowish, fleshy fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in dry woodlands. Due to its unique appearance and adaptation to harsh climates, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
