    "intro": "Cymopterus acaulis var. greeleyorum, commonly known as the greasepaint lomatium, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and a tall, flowering stem that bears yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, dry habitats such as sagebrush steppe and open woodlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, stiff hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is part of the Apiaceae family, known for its aromatic compounds and often edible or medicinal properties."
