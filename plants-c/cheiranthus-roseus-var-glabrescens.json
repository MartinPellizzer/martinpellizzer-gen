    "intro": "Cheiranthus roseus var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous wallflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, showy flowers and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun exposure. Its flowers, which range in color from pink to white, bloom in early spring and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The variety glabrescens is distinguished by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves, giving it a more refined appearance compared to other wallflower varieties."
