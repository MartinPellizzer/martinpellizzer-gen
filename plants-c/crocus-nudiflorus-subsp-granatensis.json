    "intro": "Crocus nudiflorus subsp. granatensis, commonly known as the Granada crocus, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The flowers typically bloom in late winter or early spring, often before the leaves emerge. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in sunny to partially shaded environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its early blooming habit."
