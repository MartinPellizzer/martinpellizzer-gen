It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety coating. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the warmer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight. Crassula ecklonii is popular in rock gardens and as a houseplant due to its ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements."
