It is a deciduous shrub or small tree with a rugged, often twisted trunk and dense, thorny branches. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins that give it its scientific name. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, appearing in clusters, and the fruit is a yellow-orange, hairy peach-like fruit. This plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure."
