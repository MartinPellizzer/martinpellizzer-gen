    "intro": "Caladenia lowanensis, commonly known as the Lowan Spider-orchid, is a species of orchid native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and distinctive, spider-like flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color. The plant grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as woodlands and heathlands. It produces small, elongated leaves and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and threatened species."
