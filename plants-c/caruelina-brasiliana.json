It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its showy, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly encountered in its natural habitat."
