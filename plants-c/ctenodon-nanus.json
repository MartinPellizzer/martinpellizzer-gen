    "intro": "Ctenodon nanus, commonly known as the dwarf waterwheel plant, is a small aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It has a distinctive whorl of narrow, ribbon-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its leaves are typically green to bluish-green and can grow up to 10 centimeters in length. Ctenodon nanus is often cultivated in water gardens for its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
