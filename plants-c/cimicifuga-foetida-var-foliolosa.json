    "intro": "Cimicifuga foetida var. foliolosa, commonly known as black cohosh, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features tall, unbranched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, compound leaves that are deeply lobed. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late summer, which are followed by reddish-brown berries. Its roots and rhizomes are the primary parts used in traditional medicine for their hormonal and anti-inflammatory properties. It thrives in rich, moist soils and partial to full shade, making it a common sight in woodland habitats."
