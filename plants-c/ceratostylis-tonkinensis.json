It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and a dense cluster of small, greenish-white flowers. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in wetland and marshy environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in moist soil and spread vegetatively. Its unique floral structure and ecological adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
