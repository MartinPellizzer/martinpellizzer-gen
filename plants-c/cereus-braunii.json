    "intro": "Cereus braunii, commonly known as the Braun's night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements. Cereus braunii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
