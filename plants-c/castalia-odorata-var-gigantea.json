    "intro": "Castalia odorata var. gigantea, commonly known as the giant castalia, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its large, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 feet in diameter. Native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, it thrives in humid, warm climates with high light exposure. The plant produces showy, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it requires careful attention to soil drainage and moisture levels. Despite its beauty, it is relatively rare in cultivation due to its specific environmental needs."
