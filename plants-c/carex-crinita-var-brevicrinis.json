    "intro": "Carex crinita var. brevicrinis, commonly known as the short-hair sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It features slender, grass-like stems that are often reddish at the base and bear dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and typically have a slight sheen, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swales, ditches, and the edges of ponds. This variety is closely related to other Carex species but is distinguished by its shorter, more compact inflorescences and distinctive foliage."
