    "intro": "Cestrum requienii, commonly known as the golden trumpet vine, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Cestrum requienii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in gardens."
