    "intro": "Carex hendersonii, commonly known as Henderson's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like flower clusters. Native to parts of North America, this plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Its foliage is typically green to blue-green, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. Carex hendersonii is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
