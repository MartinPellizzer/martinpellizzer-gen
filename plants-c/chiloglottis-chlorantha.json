    "intro": "Chiloglottis chlorantha, commonly known as the green-leafed duckbill, is an epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, duckbill-shaped flowers that are typically green or yellow-green in color. The plant has fibrous roots that attach to tree trunks, allowing it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural humid environment. Chiloglottis chlorantha blooms during the cooler months, producing fragrant flowers that attract specific pollinators like birds and insects."
