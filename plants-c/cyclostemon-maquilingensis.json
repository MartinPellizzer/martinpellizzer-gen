    "intro": "Cyclostemon maquilingensis, commonly known as the Maquiling cycad, is a rare and endemic cycad species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical rainforest environments, often growing in shaded, moist areas with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
