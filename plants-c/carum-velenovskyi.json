    "intro": "Carum velenovskyi, commonly known as the Velenovsky's caraway, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in umbels. Its leaves are narrow and aromatic, similar to other caraway species, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain essential oils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Carum velenovskyi is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
