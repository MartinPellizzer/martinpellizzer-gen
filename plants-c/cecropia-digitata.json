    "intro": "Cecropia digitata, commonly known as the giant water fig, is a fast-growing tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and distinctive, swollen, woody stems that are often used as nesting sites by birds and bats. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with ants, which reside in the hollow stems and protect the tree from herbivores. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed habitats make it an important pioneer species in secondary forests. The plant also plays a role in nutrient cycling through its extensive root system and leaf litter."
