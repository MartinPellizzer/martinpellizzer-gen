    "intro": "Cynosurus echinatus subsp. elegans, commonly known as the velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland margins and wet meadows. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological habitats and a subject of study in plant taxonomy."
