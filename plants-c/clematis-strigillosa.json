The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a versatile addition to gardens. Clematis strigillosa is also valued for its ability to climb trellises and support structures, adding vertical interest to landscapes."
