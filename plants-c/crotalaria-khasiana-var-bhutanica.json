    "intro": "Crotalaria khasiana var. bhutanica, commonly known as Bhutan crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Himalayas, particularly Bhutan and India. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories and is often found in mountainous regions. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod, and the plant has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which helps enrich the soil. This species is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
