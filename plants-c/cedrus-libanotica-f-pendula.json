    "intro": "Cedrus libanotica f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping cedar of Lebanon, is a unique form of the Lebanon cedar characterized by its cascading, drooping branches. This cultivar exhibits a distinctive pyramidal shape with long, pendulous shoots that create a soft, flowing appearance. It is a slow-growing evergreen conifer with dark green, needle-like leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant is native to the mountains of Lebanon but is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value. Its botanical features make it a striking addition to landscapes, though it requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive."
