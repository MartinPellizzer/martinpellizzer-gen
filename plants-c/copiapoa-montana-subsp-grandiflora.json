    "intro": "Copiapoa montana subsp. grandiflora, commonly known as the Giant Copiapoa, is a cacti species native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces large, white, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It has a dense covering of pale blue to grayish-green spines, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. This subspecies is particularly valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in arid gardens."
