    "intro": "Ceratochloa marginata, commonly known as the marginated grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, linear leaves with a distinctive white or pale margin. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and grasslands. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the grass family. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ornamental landscaping and for erosion control."
