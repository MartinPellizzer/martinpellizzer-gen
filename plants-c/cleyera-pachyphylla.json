    "intro": "Cleyera pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved inkberry, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and the coastal regions of the Carolinas. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, dark blue berries that are often used as ornamental plants. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Cleyera pachyphylla typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, hammocks, and other wetland environments."
