It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that consist of pairs of flowers, giving it its scientific name. The plant has adapted to its harsh environment through features such as succulent leaves and deep root systems. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Caroxylon geminiflorum is considered a vulnerable species."
