    "intro": "Corchorus puberulus, commonly known as the velvetleaf or slender dock, is a flowering plant native to various regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and heart-shaped, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stalks. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and along roadsides. Corchorus puberulus is also known for its fibrous roots, which have been used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber."
