    "intro": "Cerastium rubescens var. ovatum, commonly known as the pink sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in early spring, often appearing before the leaves fully develop. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or grayish down. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable ground cover plant in horticulture and ecological restoration projects."
