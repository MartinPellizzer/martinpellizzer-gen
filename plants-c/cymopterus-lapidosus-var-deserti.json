    "intro": "Cymopterus lapidosus var. deserti, commonly known as the desert lomatium, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants such as carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse seeds by wind. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to harsh desert environments."
