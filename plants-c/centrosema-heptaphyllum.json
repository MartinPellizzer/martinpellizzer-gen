    "intro": "Centrosema heptaphyllum, commonly known as the Brazilian straggler vine, is a leguminous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves, which are typically alternate and have a heart-shaped leaflet. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, followed by small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in moist, tropical environments and is used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable in soil enrichment and agroforestry systems."
