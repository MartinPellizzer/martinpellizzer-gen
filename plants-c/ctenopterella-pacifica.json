    "intro": "Ctenopterella pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific sea holly, is a marine flowering plant found in intertidal zones along the Pacific coast. It belongs to the family Ctenopteridaceae and is characterized by its unique, brush-like fronds that resemble the structure of a sea holly. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. It thrives in shallow, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand tidal fluctuations and wave action. Ctenopterella pacifica plays a role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for small marine organisms."
