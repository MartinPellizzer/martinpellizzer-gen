It features a tall, slender stem with large, arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces showy, white spathes that enclose small, greenish-yellow flowers. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater, preferring muddy or sandy substrates. Its delicate appearance makes it a popular choice for water gardens and pond ecosystems."
