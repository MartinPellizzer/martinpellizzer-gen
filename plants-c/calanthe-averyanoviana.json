    "intro": "Calanthe averyanoviana, commonly known as the Averyanov's calanthe, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its compact, terrestrial growth habit and produces striking, showy flowers with a unique coloration pattern. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and blooms during the spring season. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
