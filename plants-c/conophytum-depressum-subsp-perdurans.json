    "intro": "Conophytum depressum subsp. perdurans, commonly known as the \"Lentil Plant,\" is a succulent native to South Africa. It features a compact, rounded body with fleshy, ribbed leaves that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the warmer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
