    "intro": "Carex nutans var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf nodding sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, pond edges, and disturbed soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that droop downward, giving it its \"nodding\" appearance. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant is often found in wetland ecosystems. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
