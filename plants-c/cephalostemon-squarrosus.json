It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often clustered in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and unique morphology, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
