    "intro": "Castilleja conzattii, commonly known as the Conzatt's paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense whorls along the stem. It typically grows in rocky, open habitats such as grasslands and chaparral. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
