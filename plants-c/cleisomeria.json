    "intro": "Cleisomeria, commonly known as the mountain cedar, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Capparaceae. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its small, often inconspicuous flowers and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Cleisomeria species typically have woody stems and small, linear leaves adapted to reduce water loss. These plants play an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert organisms."
