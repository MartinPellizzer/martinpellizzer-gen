    "intro": "Carpidopterix, commonly known as the golden beard fern, is a rare and delicate plant belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its intricate, finely divided fronds that resemble a beard, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in temperate forests. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Carpidopterix is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
