    "intro": "Cardamine arenicola, commonly known as the sand barren watercress, is a small, delicate flowering plant native to dry, sandy soils in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other mustard family plants. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as gravelly slopes and coastal dunes. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in a single umbel at the top of the stem. The leaves are alternate, pinnately divided, and often have a peppery flavor, though the plant is not commonly cultivated for culinary use."
