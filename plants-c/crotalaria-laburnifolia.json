    "intro": "Crotalaria laburnifolia, commonly known as the golden chain bean, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that resemble small chains, which bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant has compound leaves with oval-shaped leaflets and produces elongated pods that contain kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its invasive potential in some areas, it requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption."
