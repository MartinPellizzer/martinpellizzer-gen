    "intro": "Cordia intermedia, commonly known as the Mexican whitebead, is a small evergreen tree native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by orange-red, bead-like fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soils and partial to full sun. Cordia intermedia is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and unique fruiting structure."
