    "intro": "Carex rusbyi, commonly known as Rusby's sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Native to the eastern United States, it typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomes help it spread vegetatively. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
