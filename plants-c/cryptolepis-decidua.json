It is a shrub that typically grows up to 2 meters tall, featuring compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by oval-shaped, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its roots and leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported antimalarial and antidiabetic properties. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and savanna habitats."
