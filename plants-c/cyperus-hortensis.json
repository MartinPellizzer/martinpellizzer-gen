    "intro": "Cyperus hortensis, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, triangular stems that often rise in dense clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that adds to its ornamental value. Cyperus hortensis is often cultivated in wetlands or as a landscape plant due to its adaptability to moist environments."
