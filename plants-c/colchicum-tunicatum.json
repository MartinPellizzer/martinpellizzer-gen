    "intro": "Colchicum tunicatum, commonly known as the Alpine colchicum, is a perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, tunicate (sheath-like) leaves that protect the underground corm during winter. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
