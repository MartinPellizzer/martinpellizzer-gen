    "intro": "Cirsium waldsteinii, commonly known as the Waldstein's thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and eastern Europe. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring a robust stem covered in rough, prickly hairs. The plant produces large, showy purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in stiff spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Cirsium waldsteinii thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in meadows and rocky areas."
