    "intro": "Colchicum autumnale var. kochii, commonly known as the autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has arrow-shaped leaves that emerge from a bulbous corm, which stores nutrients for the plant's growth. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care."
