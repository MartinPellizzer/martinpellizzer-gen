    "intro": "Cyclosorus arfakianus, commonly known as the Arfak mountain fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the island of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater habitats. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across the substrate. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. Cyclosorus arfakianus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in slow-moving streams and wetlands."
