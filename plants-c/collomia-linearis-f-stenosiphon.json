It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and slopes. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
