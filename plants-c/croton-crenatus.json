It is characterized by its distinctive, warty, and often hairy stems, which are covered in small, raised bumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by orange or red berries. Its leaves are typically alternate, simple, and have a rough, textured surface. Croton crenatus is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
