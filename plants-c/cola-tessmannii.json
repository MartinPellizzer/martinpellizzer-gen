    "intro": "Cola tessmannii, commonly known as the African cola tree, is a member of the Sterculiaceae family and is native to tropical Africa. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with smooth, grayish bark and large, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by distinctive, round, green capsules that contain stimulant-rich seeds. These seeds are the source of the caffeine and other alkaloids that make the plant economically significant. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and commercial contexts."
