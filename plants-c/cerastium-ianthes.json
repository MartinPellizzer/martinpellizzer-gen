It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, hairy leaves and clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.
