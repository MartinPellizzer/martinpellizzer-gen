    "intro": "Castalis tragus, commonly known as goat's beard, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery bracts that resemble the beard of a goat, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense, spherical cluster. Castalis tragus is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, where it can sometimes become invasive."
