    "intro": "Carduus firmus, commonly known as the common thistle, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple or pink flower heads that resemble small cones. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. Its leaves are covered in a layer of fine hairs, which contribute to its rough texture. The flowers are primarily visited by bees and other pollinators, making it an important plant in ecological settings."
