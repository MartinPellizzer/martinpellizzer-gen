    "intro": "Cardamine oligosperma var. unijuga, commonly known as the single-seeded watercress, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. Its leaves are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The species is notable for its unique reproductive strategy, producing only a single seed per fruit, which is an unusual trait among the Brassicaceae family."
