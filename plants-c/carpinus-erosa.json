    "intro": "Carpinus erosa, commonly known as the European hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along riverbanks. Its hard, dense wood has been historically used for tool handles and furniture."
