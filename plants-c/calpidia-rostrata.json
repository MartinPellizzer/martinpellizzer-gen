    "intro": "Calpidia rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated calpidia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to habitat loss, Calpidia rostrata is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
