    "intro": "Cereus variabilis, commonly known as the variable cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny stems and ability to store water efficiently. The plant produces night-blooming flowers that are typically white or pale pink, attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. Its adaptations to arid environments include thick, fleshy stems and a shallow root system. Cereus variabilis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and resilience."
