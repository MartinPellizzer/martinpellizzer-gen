The plant typically grows up to 2-3 meters in height, with hairy stems and lobed leaves. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female blooms, and the fruit develops from the female flowers. The botanical characteristics of Cucumis vulgaris make it well-suited for cultivation in temperate climates."
