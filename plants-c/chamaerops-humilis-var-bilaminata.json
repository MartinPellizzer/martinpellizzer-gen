    "intro": "Chamaerops humilis var. bilaminata, commonly known as the European fan palm, is a variety of the dwarf date palm native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its compact, fan-shaped leaves that are composed of two distinct layers, giving it its specific epithet \"bilaminata.\" The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible dates, though it is less commonly cultivated for fruit production compared to other palm species. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for Mediterranean climates. This ornamental plant is often used in landscaping for its elegant appearance and hardy nature."
