    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris, commonly known as common chickweed, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It produces small, triangular seeds enclosed in a papery casing, which aids in wind dispersal. Capsella bursa-pastoris is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
