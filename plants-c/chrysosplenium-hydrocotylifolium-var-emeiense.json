    "intro": "Chrysosplenium hydrocotylifolium var. emeiense, commonly known as the Emei mountain chrysosplenium, is a rare flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves that resemble those of hydrocotyl species. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions with cool, humid climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species requiring conservation efforts."
