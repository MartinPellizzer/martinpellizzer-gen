It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fragrant flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered critically endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
