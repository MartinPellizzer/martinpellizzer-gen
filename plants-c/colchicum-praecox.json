    "intro": "Colchicum praecox, commonly known as the early autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Colchicaceae and is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous corm, which serves as its storage organ. Its flowers are typically arranged in a single umbel and are surrounded by three leaf-like bracts. Colchicum praecox is noted for its medicinal properties, as it contains colchicine, a compound used in the treatment of gout and certain inflammatory diseases."
