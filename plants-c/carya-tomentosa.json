    "intro": "Carya tomentosa, commonly known as the hazelnut or filbert, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It belongs to the walnut family (Juglandaceae) and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces catkin-like male flowers and female flowers that develop into edible, spiky nuts encased in a hairy husk. Its nut is widely cultivated for its flavor and nutritional value, and it also plays an important role in wildlife habitats."
