    "intro": "Cyathea subglabra, commonly known as the smooth tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a smooth, grayish-brown trunk that lacks the fibrous covering found in many other ferns. Its fronds are typically green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a leathery texture. Cyathea subglabra is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
