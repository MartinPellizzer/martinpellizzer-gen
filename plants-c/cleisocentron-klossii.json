    "intro": "Cleisocentron klossii, commonly known as the Kloss's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the island of Sumba in Indonesia. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, Cleisocentron klossii is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN."
