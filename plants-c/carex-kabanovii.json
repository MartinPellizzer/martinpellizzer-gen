It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spike-like flowers, which are often wind-pollinated.
