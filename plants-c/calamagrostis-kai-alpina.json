    "intro": "Calamagrostis kai-alpina, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its ability to thrive in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes where it forms dense, low-growing clumps. Calamagrostis kai-alpina is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in stabilizing soil in harsh, mountainous habitats."
