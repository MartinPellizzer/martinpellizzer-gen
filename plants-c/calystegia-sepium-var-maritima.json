    "intro": "Calystegia sepium var. maritima, commonly known as sea bindweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is a trailing or climbing vine with heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange. The plant thrives in sandy or salty soils and is often found along shorelines and dunes. It has a long flowering period, usually from late spring to early autumn, and is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. Sea bindweed is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
