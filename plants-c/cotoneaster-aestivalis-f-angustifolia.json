    "intro": "Cotoneaster aestivalis f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf cotoneaster, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical species, giving it a distinct appearance. The plant produces clusters of white, five-petaled flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions. This cultivar is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its hardy nature and seasonal interest."
