    "intro": "Cynanchum tamifolium, commonly known as the Japanese swallowwort, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. Its fruits are follicles that release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Cynanchum tamifolium has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
