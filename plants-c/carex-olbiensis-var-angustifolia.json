    "intro": "Carex olbiensis var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshy areas, along stream banks, or in shaded woodlands. The plant features grass-like leaves that are narrow and linear, with a dark green coloration. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of small, three-ranked spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
