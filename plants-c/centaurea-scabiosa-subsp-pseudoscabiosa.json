    "intro": "Centaurea scabiosa subsp. pseudoscabiosa, commonly known as the lesser scorched grass, is a flowering plant native to central and southern Europe. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant features striking purple to pink bracts that surround its small, yellow flowers, which bloom in summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, often with a bluish-gray hue, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
