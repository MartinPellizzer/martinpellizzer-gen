    "intro": "Cheiranthus griffithii, commonly known as the Kashmir Wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of India and Pakistan. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant features bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. The plant is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain."
