It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy leaves and showy blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in cool, humid environments at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Its sepals are rough to the touch, giving it its common name, and it is often found in shaded, forested areas. The flowers bloom in clusters and are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
