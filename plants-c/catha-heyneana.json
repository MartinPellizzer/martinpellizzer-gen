It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form with opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds.

The leaves contain psychoactive compounds, particularly cathinone and cathine, which contribute to its traditional use as a stimulant."
