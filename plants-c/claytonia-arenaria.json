    "intro": "Claytonia arenaria, commonly known as sandstone sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often found in alpine and arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by heart-shaped leaves that are succulent and edible. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Claytonia arenaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
