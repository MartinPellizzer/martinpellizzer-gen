It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, rushes, and similar plants. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinct midrib, and it produces small, clustered spikelets that contain both male and female flowers. The species is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological value."
