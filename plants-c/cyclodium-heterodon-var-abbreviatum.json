    "intro": "Cyclodium heterodon var. abbreviatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf cyclodium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typically hairy foliage. The plant features small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Cyclodium heterodon var. abbreviatum is adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems and a low-growing habit to minimize exposure to harsh environmental conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
