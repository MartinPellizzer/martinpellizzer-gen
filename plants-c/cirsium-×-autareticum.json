It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple or pink flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens despite its prickly nature."
