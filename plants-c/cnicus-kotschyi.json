    "intro": "Cnicus kotschyi, commonly known as the Armenian burrweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Central Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that aid in seed dispersal by clinging to animals or clothing. It typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, showing a degree of drought tolerance. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies in its native range."
