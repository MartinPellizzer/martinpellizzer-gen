    "intro": "Carex caryophyllea proles insulana, commonly known as the island sedge, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flower heads. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
