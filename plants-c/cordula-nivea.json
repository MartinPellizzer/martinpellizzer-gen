    "intro": "Cordula nivea, commonly known as the snow cordula, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its small, white or pale green flowers appear in late spring, adding a subtle floral display. Cordula nivea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
