    "intro": "Cuscuta ceanothi, commonly known as the Indian dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host plant. The plant is native to various regions of Asia and is often found growing on shrubs and trees. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, and human activity, allowing it to spread to new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural and ornamental plants."
