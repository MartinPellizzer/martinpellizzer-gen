    "intro": "Cyphopsis bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous orchid, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive bulb-like structure, which stores water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
