    "intro": "Ceropteris \u00d7 longipes var. argentea, commonly known as the silver maidenhair fern, is a hybrid variety of the maidenhair fern family. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that exhibit a silvery or pale green hue on the underside. This plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while its fronds are typically leathery and persistent. The varietal name 'argentea' refers to its distinctive silvery appearance, making it a popular ornamental plant."
