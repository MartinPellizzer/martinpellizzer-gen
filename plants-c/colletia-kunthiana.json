    "intro": "Colletia kunthiana, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to dry climates. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are often pink or red, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are usually small, fleshy, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Colletia kunthiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environments."
