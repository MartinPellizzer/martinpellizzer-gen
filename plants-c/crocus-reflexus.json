    "intro": "Crocus reflexus, commonly known as the reflexed crocus, is a species of flowering plant in the Iridaceae family. It is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, typically growing in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces delicate, early spring blooms with pale yellow to orange petals, often with a distinctive reflexed (curled back) appearance. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous corm. Crocus reflexus is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its early blooming habit."
