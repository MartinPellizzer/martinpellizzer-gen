    "intro": "Cactus radiosus var. neomexicanus, commonly known as the New Mexico prickly pear, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a spineless cactus with flat, paddle-shaped stems that store water efficiently, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are pollinated by nocturnal insects. Its fruit, a rounded, fleshy structure, contains seeds and is edible when ripe. This variety is particularly noted for its resilience and ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions."
