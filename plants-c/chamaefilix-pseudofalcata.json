    "intro": "Chamaefilix pseudofalcata, commonly known as the false falcate saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
