It features prostrate stems that produce small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters. The leaves are typically rounded and covered with a sticky, glandular substance, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetlands. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
