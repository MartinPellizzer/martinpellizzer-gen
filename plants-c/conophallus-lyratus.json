    "intro": "Conophallus lyratus, commonly known as the lyre-shaped coral fungus, is a unique member of the Gomphaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, lyre-shaped cap that is typically yellow to orange in color. The stem is often shorter than the cap and may have a reddish or brownish hue. This fungus is saprophytic, growing on decaying wood in moist, shaded environments. It is found primarily in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in decomposing organic matter."
