    "intro": "Coronilla ramosissima var. ifniensis, commonly known as the Ifni sweet clover, is a perennial legume native to the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in dense spikes, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it can contribute to soil fertility in agricultural settings."
