    "intro": "Carum rupestre, commonly known as rock parsley, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Mediterranean. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained environments. The plant features slender, aromatic leaves and small white or greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in umbels. Its root system is fibrous, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Carum rupestre is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in arid landscapes."
