    "intro": "Cleistogenes bulgarica, commonly known as the Bulgarian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southeastern Europe. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects."
