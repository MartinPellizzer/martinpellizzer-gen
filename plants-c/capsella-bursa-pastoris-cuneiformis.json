    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris cuneiformis, commonly known as the heart-shaped weed or common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, round seeds enclosed in a cup-like structure called a silique, which is characteristic of the Brassicaceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it a common weed in many temperate regions."
