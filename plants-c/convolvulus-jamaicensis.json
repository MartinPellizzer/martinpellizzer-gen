    "intro": "Convolvulus jamaicensis, commonly known as Jamaican morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean region. It is a climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from purple to blue. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain areas."
