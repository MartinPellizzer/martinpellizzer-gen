    "intro": "Cissus lelyi, commonly known as the African snow vine, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil. Cissus lelyi is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance."
