    "intro": "Cryptantha racemosa var. lignosa, commonly known as the stiff cryptantha, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its erect, woody stems that give it a shrub-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained soils in open, sunny habitats. This species is often found in grasslands and rocky areas, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
