    "intro": "Cliffortia trifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found on coastal cliffs and rocky outcrops. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Cliffortia trifida is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
