    "intro": "Cornus capitata subsp. capitata, commonly known as the common cornel, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, white, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by bright red berries in autumn. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly rough texture. It is often found in woodland edges, rocky areas, and dry soils. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant autumn foliage and attractive fruiting display."
