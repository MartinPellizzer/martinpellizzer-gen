    "intro": "Coffea schmidtii, commonly known as the Schmidt's coffee, is a rare and lesser-known species of the coffee plant. It is native to the highlands of Ethiopia and is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and compact growth habit. The plant produces red berries that contain two seeds, which are used to make coffee. It thrives in cool, humid climates with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and low yield, it is not widely cultivated or commercially used."
