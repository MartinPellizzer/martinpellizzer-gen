    "intro": "Chenopodium querciforme, commonly known as tree spinach, is a flowering plant species native to the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual that grows up to 2 meters tall, characterized by its branched, tree-like structure. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves with a rough texture and a distinctive reddish or purplish coloration. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
