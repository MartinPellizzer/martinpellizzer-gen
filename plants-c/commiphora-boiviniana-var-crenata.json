    "intro": "Commiphora boiviniana var. crenata, commonly known as the crenate myrrh tree, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Burseraceae family. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves with a distinctive wavy or crenate margin, which gives it its botanical name. The plant produces a resinous sap that has been used in traditional medicine and as a fragrance in some cultures. It is native to Madagascar and thrives in dry, tropical environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
