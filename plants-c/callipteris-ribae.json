    "intro": "Callipteris ribae, commonly known as the Hawaiian windmill palm, is a striking tropical plant native to the islands of Hawaii. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, fan-shaped leaves that resemble a windmill, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in coastal areas and dry forests. Its unique appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in landscaping. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
