    "intro": "Cockaynea gracilis, commonly known as the slender cockaynea, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with low moisture availability. Cockaynea gracilis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
