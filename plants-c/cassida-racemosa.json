    "intro": "Cassida racemosa, commonly known as the clustered spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and distinctive floral structures. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Cassida racemosa typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its foliage is usually hairy, and it can be invasive in certain regions where it outcompetes native vegetation."
