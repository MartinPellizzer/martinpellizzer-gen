    "intro": "Calia secundiflora subsp. albofoliolata, commonly known as the white-leafed calia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its pale green, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
