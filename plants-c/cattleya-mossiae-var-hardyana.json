It features large, showy blooms in shades of pink, white, and purple, often with intricate patterns. This variety is more cold-hardy than many other Cattleya species, making it suitable for outdoor cultivation in temperate climates. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, with regular watering during the growing season. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for both collectors and gardeners."
