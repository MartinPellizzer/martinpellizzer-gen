    "intro": "Canistrum minutum, commonly known as the small-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in tropical and subtropical regions. It possesses small, oval-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to host plants. Canistrum minutum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain birds and insects."
