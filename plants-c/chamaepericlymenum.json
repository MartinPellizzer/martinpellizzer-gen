    "intro": "Chamaepericlymenum, commonly known as the alpine buttonweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs such as parsley and carrots. The plant typically has small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are finely divided and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. Chamaepericlymenum is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
