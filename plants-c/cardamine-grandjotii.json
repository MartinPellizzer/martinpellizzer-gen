    "intro": "Cardamine grandjotii, commonly known as the Grandjot's watercress, is a rare and delicate member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and clusters of white, spurred flowers. Native to the mountainous regions of southern China, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its growth is highly restricted, often found in rocky stream banks and mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
