    "intro": "Chondrodendron hederifolium, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically opposite or alternate in arrangement, with a waxy, glossy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used as a ground cover or climbing plant in ornamental horticulture. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate various soil types make it both useful and sometimes invasive in certain regions."
