    "intro": "Cynosurus hystrix, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Cynosurus hystrix is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in various habitats."
