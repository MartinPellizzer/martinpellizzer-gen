    "intro": "Chrysocoma quadrangularis, commonly known as the African thornapple, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, pale green leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by spherical, greenish fruits that turn red when mature. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for wildlife."
