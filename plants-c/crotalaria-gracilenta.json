It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that are elongated and often curved, containing numerous tiny seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture, contributing to its identification. Crotalaria gracilenta is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
