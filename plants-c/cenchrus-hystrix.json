    "intro": "Cenchrus hystrix, commonly known as the spiked grass or needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and stiff, spiky leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is well adapted to dry and disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural fields. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, contributing to its ecological significance."
