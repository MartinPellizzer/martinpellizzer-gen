    "intro": "Celastrus tetramerus, commonly known as the four-toothed staff-vine, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cymes, followed by woody, four-angled capsules containing numerous seeds. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the genus Celastrus, often found in forest understories. The plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its medicinal properties remain under study."
