    "intro": "Carex globosa, commonly known as the globular sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown, arranged in spikelets. Carex globosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its compact, rounded growth habit makes it an attractive addition to wetland restoration projects and native plant gardens."
