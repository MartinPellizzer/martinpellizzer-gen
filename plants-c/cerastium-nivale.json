    "intro": "Cerastium nivale, commonly known as snow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the snow has fully melted. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold environments. Cerastium nivale is adapted to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
