It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its foliage is thick and waxy, which helps retain moisture in its natural habitat. The flowers, when present, are usually small and clustered, adding to the plant's ornamental appeal."
