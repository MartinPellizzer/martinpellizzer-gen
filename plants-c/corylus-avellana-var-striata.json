    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. striata, commonly known as the striated hazel, is a variant of the common hazel native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely striped bark and smaller, more compact growth habit compared to the standard hazel. The plant produces edible nuts enclosed in spiny husks, which are typically harvested in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable ornamental and edible plant for gardens. Its unique appearance and ecological value make it a valuable addition to both landscapes and wildlife habitats."
