    "intro": "Cyclophyllum ixoroides, commonly known as the African cycad, is a species of cycad native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Cyclophyllum ixoroides is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh climates. Its slow growth and long lifespan make it a valuable component of its native ecosystems."
