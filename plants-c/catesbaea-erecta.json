    "intro": "Catesbaea erecta, commonly known as the sweetgum or American sweetgum, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and striking, star-shaped leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by spiny, spherical fruit clusters. Its most distinctive feature is the exudation of a milky sap, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of latex. Catesbaea erecta thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular ornamental and shade tree in landscaping."
