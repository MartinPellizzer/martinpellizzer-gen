    "intro": "Coilostigma dregeanum, commonly known as the African bluebell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features striking blue to violet bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and drought tolerance."
