    "intro": "Carduus nutans var. stribrnyi, commonly known as the striped thistle, is a variant of the common thistle native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, and the flower heads are surrounded by a series of bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some historical use in traditional medicine."
