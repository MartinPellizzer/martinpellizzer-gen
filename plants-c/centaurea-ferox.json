    "intro": "Centaurea ferox, commonly known as the fierce centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its erect, spindly stems and striking purple or red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. Centaurea ferox is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and it produces small, seed-like structures called achenes. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand arid conditions."
