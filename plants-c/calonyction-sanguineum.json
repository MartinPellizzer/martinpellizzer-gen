    "intro": "Calonyction sanguineum, commonly known as the red sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of tiny, pink to red flowers during the spring and early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in its harsh environment. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in loose, sandy soils. Calonyction sanguineum is adapted to full sun and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
