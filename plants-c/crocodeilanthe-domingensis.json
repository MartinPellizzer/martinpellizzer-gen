    "intro": "Crocodeilanthe domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican bolete, is a species of bolete mushroom native to the Dominican Republic. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown cap and a pale yellow to cream-colored stem. The fruiting bodies typically appear in late summer and early autumn, growing in association with various tree species. Its spores are released from a unique, smooth, and often sticky pore surface on the underside of the cap. This mushroom is notable for its ecological role in forest ecosystems, contributing to nutrient cycling through decomposition."
