    "intro": "Campanula scheuchzeri var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and alpine tundra. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
