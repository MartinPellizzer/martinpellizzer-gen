It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and is often found growing on rocky outcrops and cliffs. The plant has dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing remarkable drought tolerance. Cheilanthes mysurensis is a valuable species for ecological studies due to its unique morphology and habitat specificity."
