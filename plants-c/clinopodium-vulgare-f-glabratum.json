    "intro": "Clinopodium vulgare f. glabratum, commonly known as slender woodruff, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to Europe. It features small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, though the 'glabratum' form is less hairy than the typical species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its botanical characteristics make it a valued plant in both horticulture and traditional herbal medicine."
