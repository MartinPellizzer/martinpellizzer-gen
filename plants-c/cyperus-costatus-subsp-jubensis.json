    "intro": "Cyperus costatus subsp. jubensis, commonly known as the swamp cyperus, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow flowers. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
