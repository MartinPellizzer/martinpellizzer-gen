    "intro": "Convolvulus dorycnium subsp. subhirsutus, commonly known as the hairy leaf morning glory, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and hairy stems and leaves, which give it its subspecific name. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue to violet in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and rocky areas. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Convolvulaceae family."
