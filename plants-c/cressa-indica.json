    "intro": "Cressa indica, commonly known as Indian cress, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and slightly hairy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. The plant is valued for its edible leaves and seeds, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
