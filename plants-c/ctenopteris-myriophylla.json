    "intro": "Ctenopteris myriophylla, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its fronds are divided into numerous small, feather-like segments called pinnae. Ctenopteris myriophylla plays an important ecological role by providing habitat for aquatic organisms and stabilizing water bodies."
