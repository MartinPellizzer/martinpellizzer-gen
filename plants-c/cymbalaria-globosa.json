    "intro": "Cymbalaria globosa, commonly known as the globular figwart, is a flowering plant in the family Scrophulariaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its fleshy, globular leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-purple flowers. Native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a notable species in ecological studies and horticulture."
