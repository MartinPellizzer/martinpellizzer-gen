It is characterized by its long, arching leaves that are typically variegated with white and green stripes. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright green, rope-like berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate to bright indirect light. Chlorophytum longum is popular as a houseplant due to its ease of care and air-purifying qualities."
