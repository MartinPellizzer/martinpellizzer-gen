    "intro": "Chorizanthe robusta var. robusta, commonly known as the robust choris, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months, which are followed by bristly, triangular seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
