    "intro": "Cryosophila argentea, commonly known as the silver frostflower, is a rare and delicate plant adapted to extreme cold environments. It is characterized by its silvery, feathery foliage that reflects light and helps reduce heat loss. This plant typically grows in high-altitude regions and tundra environments where temperatures remain consistently low. Its flowering period is brief, occurring during the short summer season when temperatures briefly rise. Due to its specialized habitat and sensitivity to climate change, Cryosophila argentea is considered a vulnerable species."
