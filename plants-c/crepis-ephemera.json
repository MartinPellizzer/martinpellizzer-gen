    "intro": "Crepis ephemera, commonly known as the ephemeral hawk's-beard, is a small annual flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in late summer, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its short lifespan and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species."
