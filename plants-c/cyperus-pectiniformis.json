    "intro": "Cyperus pectiniformis, commonly known as the feather sedge, is a flowering plant species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, feather-like inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Cyperus pectiniformis is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive appearance and adaptability to various soil conditions."
