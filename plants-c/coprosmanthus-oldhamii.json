It is characterized by its showy, orange-red to reddish-brown flowers that resemble small lanterns, which appear in late summer to early autumn. The plant has dark green, ovate leaves that provide a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for both garden beds and container planting. Coprosmanthus oldhamii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
