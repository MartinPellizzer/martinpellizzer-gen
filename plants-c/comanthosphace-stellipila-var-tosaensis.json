    "intro": "Comanthosphace stellipila var. tosaensis, commonly known as the Tosa variant of the star-shaped comanthosphace, is a rare and delicate aquatic plant native to Japan. It is characterized by its small, star-like spores that are typically found in freshwater environments. The plant is known for its unique morphology, with a short, branched stem and delicate, translucent spore capsules. It thrives in cool, nutrient-rich waters and is often found in shaded, still pools. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
