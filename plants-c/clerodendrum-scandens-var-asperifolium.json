    "intro": "Clerodendrum scandens var. asperifolium, commonly known as the rough-leaved glorybower, is a vigorous climbing shrub native to tropical regions of Asia. It features opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically rough to the touch due to their pubescent surface. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in clusters, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which attract pollinators like birds and bees. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its vibrant floral display."
