    "intro": "Callitriche palustris var. strumosa, commonly known as the marsh stitchwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to wetlands and slow-moving water bodies. It typically grows in shallow water, often forming dense mats on the surface or submerged in the sediment. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are usually arranged in whorls around the stem. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish."
