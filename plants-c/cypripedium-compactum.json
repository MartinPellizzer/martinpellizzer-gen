    "intro": "Cypripedium compactum, commonly known as the compact lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, grass-like foliage and a tall, slender stem that bears a spike of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. It is a herbaceous plant with a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. Due to its beauty and rarity, it is often protected in its natural habitat."
