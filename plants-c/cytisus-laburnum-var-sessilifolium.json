    "intro": "Cytisus laburnum var. sessilifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved laburnum, is a shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stems without stalks, giving the plant a compact appearance. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to temperate climates."
