    "intro": "Colymbada mariana, commonly known as the Florida marsh mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the wetlands of Florida. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of lakes and ponds. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is characterized by its hairy stems and fibrous roots, which help it thrive in waterlogged conditions. Colymbada mariana plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
