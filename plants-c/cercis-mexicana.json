    "intro": "Cercis mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican redbud, is a small deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The tree produces flat, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Cercis mexicana is well adapted to arid climates and is often found in rocky soils and limestone areas."
