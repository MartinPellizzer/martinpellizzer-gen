    "intro": "Caleana sullivanii, commonly known as the Sullivan's candleplant, is a striking orchid native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its unique, candle-like flower spike that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces vibrant red and orange flowers that resemble candles. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to hot, dry conditions. Caleana sullivanii is a protected species due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
