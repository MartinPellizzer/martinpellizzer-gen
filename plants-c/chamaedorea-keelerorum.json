    "intro": "Chamaedorea keelerorum, commonly known as the Keeler's bamboo palm, is a species of flowering plant in the Arecaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central America, particularly Belize and Guatemala. This plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and pinnate leaves that are often a deep green. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its air-purifying qualities and low maintenance requirements. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits."
