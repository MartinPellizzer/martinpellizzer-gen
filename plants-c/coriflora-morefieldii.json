    "intro": "Coriflora morefieldii, commonly known as the Morefield's coralflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its vibrant, coral-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along its slender stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
