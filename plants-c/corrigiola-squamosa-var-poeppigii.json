    "intro": "Corrigiola squamosa var. poeppigii, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, white or pink flowers. It thrives in rocky, arid, or coastal environments, often found in regions with well-drained soil. The plant's leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture in harsh conditions. It is native to parts of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy or rocky soils."
