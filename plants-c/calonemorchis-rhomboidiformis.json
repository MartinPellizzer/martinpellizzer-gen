    "intro": "Calonemorchis rhomboidiformis, commonly known as the rhomboid flatworm, is a parasitic flatworm belonging to the class Turbellaria. It is characterized by its elongated, flattened body with a distinctive rhomboid shape, which gives it its scientific name. This species is typically found in freshwater environments, where it inhabits the intestines of certain aquatic snails. Its body is covered in cilia, which aid in locomotion, and it lacks a true digestive system, relying on osmoregulation for nutrient absorption. Calonemorchis rhomboidiformis plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its host and environment as a parasitic organism."
