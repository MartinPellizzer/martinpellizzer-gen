    "intro": "Claytonia grayi, commonly known as the gray's springbeauty, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It belongs to the Portulacaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, cushion-like form. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are succulent and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Claytonia grayi is often found in rocky soils and open woodlands, thriving in partial shade to full sun."
