    "intro": "Clidemia boliviensis, commonly known as the Bolivian mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface and produces small, white to pale pink flowers clustered in cymes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests, where it contributes to the understory vegetation. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
