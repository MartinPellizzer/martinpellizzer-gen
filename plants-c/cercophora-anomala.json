    "intro": "Cercophora anomala, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Cercophora anomala is a carnivorous plant, supplementing its nutrient intake by digesting trapped prey."
