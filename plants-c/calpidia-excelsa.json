    "intro": "Calpidia excelsa, commonly known as the giant calpidia, is a striking member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, erect stature and finely divided leaves. It is native to high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family, and is often found growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Its fibrous roots and hollow stems make it an interesting subject for botanical study. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
