    "intro": "Cuscuta occidentalis, commonly known as the western dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that begins with seeds germinating on the surface of host plants. The plant forms a dense network of slender, thread-like stems that wrap around its host, penetrating its tissues to extract water and nutrients. It is native to North America and can be found on various plants such as tomatoes, beans, and grasses. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
