    "intro": "Chamaecytisus hirsutus subsp. pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf shrub rose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that are densely arranged along its stems. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact form and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, exhibiting drought tolerance once established."
