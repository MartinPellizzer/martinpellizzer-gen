    "intro": "Campium laciniatum, commonly known as the cut-leaved campion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Campium laciniatum is often found in open habitats and is relatively hardy, though it prefers well-drained soil."
