    "intro": "Catopsis inconspicua, commonly known as the miniature fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, clustered fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of tropical forests. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense mats, which help anchor it to its substrate. The leaves are pinnately divided with a soft, leathery texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
