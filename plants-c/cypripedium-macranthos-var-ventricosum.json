    "intro": "Cypripedium macranthos var. ventricosum, commonly known as the giant white lady's tresses, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and long, white to pale pink flower spikes that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces numerous small, showy flowers arranged in a loose, loose spiral along the stem, with three petals and three sepals. It thrives in cool, humid environments with partial shade and well-drained soil. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
