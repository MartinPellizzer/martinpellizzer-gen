    "intro": "Clematis pseudoconnata, commonly known as the purple clematis, is a flowering vine native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its climbing habit and clusters of small, fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound, palmately arranged leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are typically covered in fine, hairy pubescence. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Clematis pseudoconnata is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to climb trellises or other structures."
