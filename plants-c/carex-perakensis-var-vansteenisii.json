    "intro": "Carex perakensis var. vansteenisii, commonly known as the Vansteenis' sedge, is a variant of the Carex genus native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and compact, cylindrical flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and swampy areas. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its botanical significance lies in its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its use in horticultural settings for moisture-retentive soils."
