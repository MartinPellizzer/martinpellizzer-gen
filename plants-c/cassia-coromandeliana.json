    "intro": "Cassia coromandeliana, commonly known as the Indian laburnum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often have a yellowish-green hue. The plant produces bright yellow, pendulous flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in long, slender pods that split open to release the seeds. Cassia coromandeliana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
