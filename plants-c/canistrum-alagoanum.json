It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees, drawing water and nutrients from them. The plant has small, ovate leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers followed by red berries. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and other animals. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened and requires conservation efforts to survive."
