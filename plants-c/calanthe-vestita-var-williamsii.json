    "intro": "Calanthe vestita var. williamsii, commonly known as the Williams' calanthe, is a rare and elegant orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, upright pseudobulbs that support narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a violet or purple lip. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
