    "intro": "Cyathea neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonia tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, providing structural support and enabling it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Cyathea neocaledonica plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to forest biodiversity and soil stability."
