    "intro": "Colchicum alpinum var. parvulum, commonly known as the dwarf alpine colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It produces striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive spurred shape, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes. It is part of the Colchicaceae family and contains toxic alkaloids, making it important to handle with care. This variety is smaller than the typical Colchicum alpinum, with shorter stems and smaller flowers."
