    "intro": "Cephalomanes acranthum, commonly known as the red sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its succulent leaves and stems store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. Cephalomanes acranthum is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited rainfall."
