    "intro": "Canavalia obtusifolia f. macrophylla, commonly known as the giant horsegram or large-leaf cowpea, is a variant of the cowpea species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, ovate leaves and showy, purple-pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is a legume, meaning it has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Its seeds are typically small and edible, though the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than its yield. The species is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in arid conditions, making it a hardy and resilient plant."
