    "intro": "Carex lepageana, commonly known as the Lepage's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Carex genus, which is part of the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family. This plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It has grass-like leaves that are usually narrow and arranged in dense clusters, with spike-like flower clusters that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex lepageana is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
