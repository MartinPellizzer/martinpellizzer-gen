    "intro": "Calopogonium domingense, commonly known as the dwarf velvet bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and erect, branching stems that often grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by cylindrical pods containing several elliptical seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
