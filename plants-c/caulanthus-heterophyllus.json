It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and tall, branched flower stalks. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Caulanthus heterophyllus is often found in rocky, well-drained soils in coastal and mountainous regions. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it an important species in ecological studies of plant resilience."
