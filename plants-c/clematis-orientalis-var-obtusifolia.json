    "intro": "Clematis orientalis var. obtusifolia, commonly known as the Japanese climbing clematis, is a deciduous vine native to Japan. It features compound leaves with three to five oval, toothed leaflets that are generally broader than those of other clematis species. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners. Its vigorous growth habit requires support, such as trellises or fences, to climb and display its ornamental features."
