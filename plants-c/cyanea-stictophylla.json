    "intro": "Cyanea stictophylla, commonly known as the Hawaiian sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of Hawaii. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Cyanea stictophylla plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various native insects and birds."
