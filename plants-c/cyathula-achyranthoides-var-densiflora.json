    "intro": "Cyathula achyranthoides var. densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a basal rosette of fleshy, sparsely hairy leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cup-shaped cyathium, a characteristic feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its flowering period usually occurs during the warmer months, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
