    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 hardyanum, commonly known as the hardy lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid that exhibits a combination of traits from its parent species, Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium micranthum. It is characterized by its large, showy, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white with a distinctive yellow or orange lip. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and is adapted to grow in cool, moist environments with partial shade. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained, humus-rich soils. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and protected areas."
