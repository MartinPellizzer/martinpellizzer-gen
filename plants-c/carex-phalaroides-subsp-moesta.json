    "intro": "Carex phalaroides subsp. moesta, commonly known as the moody sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often pale green to reddish in color. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its preference for full sun to partial shade. This subspecies is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability."
