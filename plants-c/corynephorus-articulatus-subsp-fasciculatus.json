It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and dry grasslands. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
