    "intro": "Collomia debilis subsp. ipomoea, commonly known as the California morning glory, is a herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its botanical features reflect adaptations to arid environments, including hairy foliage and efficient water conservation mechanisms."
