    "intro": "Calawaya caulina, commonly known as the Philippine mountain fern, is a species of fern native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-draining soil. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Calawaya caulina plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to forest biodiversity and soil stability."
