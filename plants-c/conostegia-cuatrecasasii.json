    "intro": "Conostegia cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas's conostegia, is a rare and specialized shrub native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody capsules as its fruit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species. Its botanical features reflect adaptations to the humid, high-altitude environments of its native range."
