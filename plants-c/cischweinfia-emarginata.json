    "intro": "Cischweinfia emarginata, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The tree has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn bright red or orange in autumn. Its flowers are small and green, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring. Cischweinfia emarginata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and wetlands."
