    "intro": "Campylospermum subcordatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf campylospermum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climatic conditions."
