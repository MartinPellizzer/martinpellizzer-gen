    "intro": "Centaurea trifurcata, commonly known as the three-branched cornflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet petals and a distinctive three-lobed flower head. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in sunny environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Centaurea trifurcata is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas."
