    "intro": "Caladenia bartlettii, commonly known as the Bartlett's spider-orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family native to Western Australia. This terrestrial herbaceous plant features a single, slender stem that bears a single, intricate flower with a distinctive spider-like appearance. The orchid has a narrow, grass-like leaf and produces a vivid pink or purple flower with a long, narrow lip. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as heathlands and woodlands. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
