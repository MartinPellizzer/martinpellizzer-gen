    "intro": "Chorispora sabulosa, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often pink or purple in color, blooming from spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Chorispora sabulosa plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
