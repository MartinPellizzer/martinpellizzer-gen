    "intro": "Carpodinus foretiana, commonly known as the forest fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that grow in a compact, clustered form. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments, such as under the canopy of dense forests. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species."
