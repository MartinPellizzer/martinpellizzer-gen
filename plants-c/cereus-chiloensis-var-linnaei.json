    "intro": "Cereus chiloensis var. linnaei, commonly known as the Linnaean candleplant, is a succulent cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces white, night-blooming flowers that are often fragrant and attract nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stem. This variety is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
