    "intro": "Colletia tralhuen, commonly known as the desert candelabra, is a shrub native to arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its branching, cylindrical stems that resemble a candle. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often clustered at the ends of its branches. It has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with thick, waxy skin to reduce water loss. Colletia tralhuen is also known for its ability to store water in its stems, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems."
