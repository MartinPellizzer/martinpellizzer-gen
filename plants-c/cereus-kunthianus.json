    "intro": "Cereus kunthianus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and spiny, ribbed structure. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in arid environments with minimal water. Cereus kunthianus is often cultivated for its striking floral display and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
