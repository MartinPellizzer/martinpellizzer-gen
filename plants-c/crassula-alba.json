    "intro": "Crassula alba, commonly known as the white crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features small, fleshy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil and full sun. Crassula alba is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance."
