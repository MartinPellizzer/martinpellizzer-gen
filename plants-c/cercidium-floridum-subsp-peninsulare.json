    "intro": "Cercidium floridum subsp. peninsulare, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its ability to withstand drought conditions makes it an important species in desert ecosystems."
