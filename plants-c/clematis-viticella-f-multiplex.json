    "intro": "Clematis viticella f. multiplex, commonly known as the Dutch White Clematis, is a compact, vigorous climber with a dense growth habit. It produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom profusely in late spring to early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves with three heart-shaped leaflets, and its stems are covered in fine, silvery hairs. It is well-suited for training on trellises or arches and is relatively easy to maintain. This variety is particularly noted for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
