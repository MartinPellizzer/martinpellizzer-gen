    "intro": "Cryptadenia filicaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed cryptadenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of eastern Australia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in understorey habitats of subtropical and tropical rainforests."
