    "intro": "Cheilanthes erecta, commonly known as the upright rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to arid and rocky environments in North America. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched fronds that are typically 10\u201330 cm in length. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in crevices or on rocky outcrops. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in harsh conditions. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with lanceolate to ovate pinnae that are often covered in a fine, whitish tomentum."
