    "intro": "Carex pallescens var. neogaea, commonly known as the silver sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. This variant is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense, fine hairs covering the leaves. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats."
