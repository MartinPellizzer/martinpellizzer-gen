    "intro": "Cnicus argyracanthus var. nepalensis, commonly known as the silverleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal. It features small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
