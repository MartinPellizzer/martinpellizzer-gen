    "intro": "Cirsium undulatum f. album, commonly known as the white thistle, is a botanical variant of the common thistle. It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which contrast with the typical purple or pink hues of the species. This plant is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in meadows and grasslands. The leaves are spiny and lobed, typical of the Cirsium genus, while the stems are usually hairy. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
