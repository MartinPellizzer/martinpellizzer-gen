The plant typically grows as an annual herb, featuring slender stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. This variety is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its adaptation to harsh environmental conditions."
