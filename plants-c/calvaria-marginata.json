    "intro": "Calvaria marginata, commonly known as the margined calvaria, is a unique member of the Calvaria genus within the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often hairy and have a rough texture. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to orange flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Calvaria marginata is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in open woodlands or along riverbanks."
