    "intro": "Cleisostoma hansemannii, commonly known as the Hansemann's cleistostoma, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often hidden within the foliage. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with each new growth emerging from the base of the previous one. Its flowers are typically short-lived and are pollinated by small insects. Cleisostoma hansemannii is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
