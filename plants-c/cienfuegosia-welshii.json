    "intro": "Cienfuegosia welshii, commonly known as the Welsh's cienfuegosia, is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to a very limited geographic range in Mexico. It is a small shrub characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in its native ecosystem."
