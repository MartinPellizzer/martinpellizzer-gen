    "intro": "Cotoneaster persicus, commonly known as Persian cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the Caucasus region. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 5 meters, featuring dense, compact foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its flowers are small and white, appearing in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. Cotoneaster persicus is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
