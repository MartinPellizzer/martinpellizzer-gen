    "intro": "Crepis purpurea, commonly known as the purple hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are lance-shaped with rough edges, and the flowers are yellow with purple bracts that give it its common name. Crepis purpurea is often found in open habitats and is relatively easy to cultivate in gardens."
