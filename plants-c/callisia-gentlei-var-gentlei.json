It is characterized by its striking, silver-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental appeal and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
