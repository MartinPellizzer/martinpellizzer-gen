    "intro": "Campanula glomerata var. hispida, commonly known as the hairy bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and eastern Europe. It features dense clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered with fine, hairy glands, giving the plant its \"hispida\" designation. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, often found in meadows and woodland edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, clustered blossoms."
