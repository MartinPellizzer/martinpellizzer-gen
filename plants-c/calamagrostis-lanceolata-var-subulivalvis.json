The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its foliage is often blue-green in color, and it has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
