    "intro": "Cyanotis bulbifera, commonly known as the bulbous bluebell, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces bulb-like structures called bulbils, which are used for vegetative propagation. Its leaves are strap-shaped and often have a waxy texture, while its stems are erect and fibrous. Cyanotis bulbifera thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
