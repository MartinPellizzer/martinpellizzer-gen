    "intro": "Caesalpinia dalei, commonly known as the flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling flames, hence its common name. The plant has bipinnate leaves, which are divided into small, feather-like segments, and produces long, cylindrical pods that contain seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. The botanical features of Caesalpinia dalei make it both visually striking and ecologically valuable in its native habitats."
