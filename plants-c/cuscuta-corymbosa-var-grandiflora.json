    "intro": "Cuscuta corymbosa var. grandiflora, commonly known as giant dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its stems are slender and vine-like, allowing it to\u7f20\u7ed5 and attach to various host species. The plant is native to parts of Asia and is often found growing on crops such as rice and cotton. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a significant agricultural pest. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host plants if left unchecked."
