    "intro": "Comarum salessowii, commonly known as the lesser water crowfoot, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and ditches. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, with four to five petals, and are usually pale yellow or greenish in color. Comarum salessowii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through its filtration capabilities."
