    "intro": "Calamus palustris var. longistachys, commonly known as the marsh arrowroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features slender, creeping rhizomes and tall, erect stems that bear narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers arranged in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomes are often harvested for their starchy roots, which have been used traditionally for food. It thrives in moist soils and is an important species in wetland ecosystems."
