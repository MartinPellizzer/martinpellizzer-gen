It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods containing several elliptical seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species for agricultural use. Cicer turcicum is often used as a forage crop and for soil improvement due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
