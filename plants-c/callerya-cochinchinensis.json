    "intro": "Callerya cochinchinensis, commonly known as the Chinese callerya, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially grown."
