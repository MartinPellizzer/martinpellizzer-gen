It belongs to the family Calceolariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, slipper-shaped flowers that are often brightly colored. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to the harsh coastal conditions with its succulent leaves. It produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
