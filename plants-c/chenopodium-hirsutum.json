    "intro": "Chenopodium hirsutum, commonly known as prickly goosefoot, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically appear in clusters. The plant produces small, dry fruits called achenes, which are often surrounded by a pappus for wind dispersal. Chenopodium hirsutum thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and wastelands. It is valued in some regions for its edible leaves, though they are usually consumed when young and tender."
