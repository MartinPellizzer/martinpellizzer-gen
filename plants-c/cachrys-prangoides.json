    "intro": "Cachrys prangoides, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, dandelion-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has a basal rosette of broad, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its flowering stems are typically upright and branched, producing clusters of small, bright yellow blooms. Cachrys prangoides is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
