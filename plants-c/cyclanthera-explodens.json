    "intro": "Cyclanthera explodens, commonly known as the exploding cucumber, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often spiny fruits that mature into a yellow-orange color. The plant produces small, green, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that are typically borne in clusters. Its most notable feature is the explosive dispersal mechanism of its seeds, which are released with force when the fruit dries and splits open. This unique adaptation aids in seed dispersal across open habitats."
