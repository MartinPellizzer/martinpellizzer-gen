    "intro": "Croton subfragilis, commonly known as the fragile croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, often variegated leaves that display a mix of green, yellow, and red hues. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
