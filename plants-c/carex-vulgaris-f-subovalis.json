    "intro": "Carex vulgaris f. subovalis, commonly known as the broad-oval sedge, is a variant of the common sedge, characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike of small, three-ranked flowers. This subspecies is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
