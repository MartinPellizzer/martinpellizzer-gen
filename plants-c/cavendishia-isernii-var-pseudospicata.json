    "intro": "Cavendishia isernii var. pseudospicata, commonly known as the Spiny Cavendish, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of long, spiny bracts that enclose its small, showy flowers. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a dramatic visual impact. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
