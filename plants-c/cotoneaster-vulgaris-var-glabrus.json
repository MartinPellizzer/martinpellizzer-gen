    "intro": "Cotoneaster vulgaris var. glabrus, commonly known as the smooth cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features small, elliptical leaves that are usually smooth and glabrous. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. It is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and rocky soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
