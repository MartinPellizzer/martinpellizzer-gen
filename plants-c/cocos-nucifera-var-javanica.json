It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces coconuts that are typically smaller and have a higher oil content compared to the common coconut. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the production of coconut products."
