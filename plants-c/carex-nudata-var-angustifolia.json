    "intro": "Carex nudata var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually narrow and pointed, with a smooth texture. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, greenish flowers that are wind-pollinated. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
