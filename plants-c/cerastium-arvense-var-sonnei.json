    "intro": "Cerastium arvense var. sonnei, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to Europe. It features small, rounded leaves and clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has a shallow root system and spreads by stolons, making it a common weed in agricultural settings. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to temperate climates and poor soil conditions."
