    "intro": "Cyclosorus houi, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a rare aquatic fern species native to China. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that form a rosette shape on the water surface. The plant has a complex life cycle involving both aquatic and terrestrial phases. Its spores are released into the water, allowing for propagation in suitable wetland environments. Cyclosorus houi is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats, where it plays a role in maintaining ecological balance."
