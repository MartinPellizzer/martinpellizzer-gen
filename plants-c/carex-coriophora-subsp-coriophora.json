    "intro": "Carex coriophora subsp. coriophora, commonly known as the slender sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. This subspecies is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The plant is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates."
