    "intro": "Cyrtidiorchis, commonly known as the orchid of the genus Cyrtidiorchis, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. They are characterized by their small, delicate flowers that often display a range of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. Cyrtidiorchis species typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments. Their botanical significance lies in their unique floral structures and their role in the biodiversity of their native habitats."
