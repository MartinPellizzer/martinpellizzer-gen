    "intro": "Cochranea glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky cochranea, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, tropical environments and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its unique sticky secretions have led to its common name and may play a role in deterring herbivores. Cochranea glutinosa is often found in shaded areas under the canopy of tropical forests."
