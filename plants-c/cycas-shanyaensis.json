    "intro": "Cycas shanyaensis, commonly known as the Shanyan cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to China. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Cycas shanyaensis is notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, often exceeding several centuries. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is classified as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
