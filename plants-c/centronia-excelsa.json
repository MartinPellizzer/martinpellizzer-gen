    "intro": "Centronia excelsa, commonly known as the giant centronia, is a tall, evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by round, fleshy fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a shade tree in tropical landscapes."
