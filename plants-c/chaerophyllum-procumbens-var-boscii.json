    "intro": "Chaerophyllum procumbens var. boscii, commonly known as Bosci's ground-ivy, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic and edible plants. The plant features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its small, clustered white flowers appear in late spring to early summer, and the leaves are typically heart-shaped with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
