    "intro": "Catha transvaalensis, commonly known as the khat plant, is a shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is known for containing the stimulant compound cathinone, which contributes to its traditional use in social and cultural contexts. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in semi-arid environments. Due to its psychoactive properties, it is also subject to regulatory scrutiny in many regions."
