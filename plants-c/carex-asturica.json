    "intro": "Carex asturica, commonly known as the Asturian sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, followed by capsule fruits that disperse seeds. Due to its limited distribution, Carex asturica is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
