    "intro": "Cardamine impatiens var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, with a smooth, slightly glossy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it an effective ground cover in wetland habitats."
