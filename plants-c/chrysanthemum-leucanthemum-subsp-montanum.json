It features a rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves and produces white to pale yellow flowers with a central disc. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, high-altitude environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and often considered a specialist species."
