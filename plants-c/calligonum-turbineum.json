    "intro": "Calligonum turbineum, commonly known as the Turban spurge, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. It is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in harsh, saline conditions. Its unique, turban-shaped seed capsules are a distinguishing feature of the species."
