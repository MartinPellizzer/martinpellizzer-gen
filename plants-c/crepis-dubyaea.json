    "intro": "Crepis dubyaea, commonly known as the Dubyaea mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are typically small and yellow, arranged in a single head, and bloom in late summer. Crepis dubyaea is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates."
