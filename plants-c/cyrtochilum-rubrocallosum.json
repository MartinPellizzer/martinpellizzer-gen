    "intro": "Cyrtochilum rubrocallosum, commonly known as the red-calloused orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowers. The plant produces striking red and orange flowers with a distinctive callus on the lip, which is a notable botanical feature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Cyrtochilum rubrocallosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
