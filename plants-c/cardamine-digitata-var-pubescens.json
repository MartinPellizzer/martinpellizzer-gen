    "intro": "Cardamine digitata var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. It features a rosette of pinnately divided, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stems. Its root system consists of a taproot with lateral branches, allowing it to anchor in wet soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and early spring bloom."
