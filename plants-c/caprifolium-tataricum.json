    "intro": "Caprifolium tataricum, commonly known as Tatarian honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange, which bloom in early summer. Its berries are small, red, and edible, though they are generally not consumed by humans. Caprifolium tataricum is often found in woodland edges, stream banks, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators."
