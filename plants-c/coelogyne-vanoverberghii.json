    "intro": "Coelogyne vanoverberghii, commonly known as the Vanoverbergh's orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in its natural habitat. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, often with a distinctive yellow lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular among orchid enthusiasts and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
