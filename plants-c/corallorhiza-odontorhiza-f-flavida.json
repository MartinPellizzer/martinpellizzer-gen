    "intro": "Corallorhiza odontorhiza f. flavida, commonly known as the yellow beard tongue, is a flowering plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and woodlands. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is often found in association with certain host plants and is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
