It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. Crataegus vicana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, providing food for birds and insects."
