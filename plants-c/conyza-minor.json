    "intro": "Conyza minor, commonly known as lesser conyza, is an annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm and features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in composite heads, which are characteristic of the Asteraceae family. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it thrives in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. Conyza minor is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
