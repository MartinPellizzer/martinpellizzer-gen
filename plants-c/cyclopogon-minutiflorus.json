It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its compact growth habit. The plant features tiny, delicate flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it thrives in moist, tropical environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
