    "intro": "Coilochilus, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique, spirally twisted petals and sepals, which give them their distinctive appearance. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. Coilochilus species typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Their flowers are often brightly colored, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
