    "intro": "Chamomilla lasiocarpa, commonly known as roughleaf chamomile, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its finely hairy, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and thrives in temperate climates. It is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its aromatic properties. Despite its name, it is not closely related to the more familiar chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla)."
