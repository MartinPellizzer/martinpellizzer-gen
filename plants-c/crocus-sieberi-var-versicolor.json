    "intro": "Crocus sieberi var. versicolor, commonly known as the variable crocus, is a bulbous perennial plant native to Central Asia. It produces showy, colorful flowers that range from white to pink, purple, and yellow, often with a striking bicolor pattern. The plant typically blooms in early spring, with flowers emerging from narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming habit and the variability in flower color."
