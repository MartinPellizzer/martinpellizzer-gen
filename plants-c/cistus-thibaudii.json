    "intro": "Cistus thibaudii, commonly known as the Thibaud's rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Cistus thibaudii is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
