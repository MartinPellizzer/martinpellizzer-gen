    "intro": "Cyclopogon langei, commonly known as the Lange's cyclopogon, is a rare grass-like plant native to the island of Hispaniola. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit. The plant is typically found in humid, shaded environments, often in limestone soils. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it is known for its limited distribution and conservation status. Due to habitat loss, Cyclopogon langei is considered endangered, making it a subject of interest for botanical conservation efforts."
