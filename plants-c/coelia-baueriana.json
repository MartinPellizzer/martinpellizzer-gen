It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pale flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, Coelia baueriana is considered endangered, highlighting the need for its protection."
