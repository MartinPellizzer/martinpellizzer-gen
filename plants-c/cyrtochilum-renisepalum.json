    "intro": "Cyrtochilum renisepalum, commonly known as the kidney-spleen orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropics of South America. It is characterized by its compact, hairy pseudobulbs and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange-red, with a distinctive kidney-shaped lip. Cyrtochilum renisepalum thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is a subject of interest in both botanical research and horticulture."
