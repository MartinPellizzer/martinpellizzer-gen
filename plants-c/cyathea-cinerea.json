    "intro": "Cyathea cinerea, commonly known as the silver tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, trunk-like stem covered in a dense layer of dead fronds that give it a silvery appearance. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. Cyathea cinerea is a slow-growing plant that thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of New Zealand's native forests."
