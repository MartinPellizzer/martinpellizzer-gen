    "intro": "Cyperus coonoorensis, commonly known as the Coonoor sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, clayey soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. Due to its ecological significance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland gardens and conservation areas."
