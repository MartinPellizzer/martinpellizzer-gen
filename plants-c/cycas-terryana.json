    "intro": "Cycas terryana, commonly known as the Terry's cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with the female cones being more prominent and containing the seeds. Cycas terryana is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
