    "intro": "Cephalanthera pallens var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender white helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lanceolate leaves that are typically green with a faintly veined appearance. The plant produces pale yellow to white flowers with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows. This orchid is noted for its lack of a visible above-ground root system, relying instead on a network of rhizomes for nutrient absorption."
