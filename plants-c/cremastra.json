    "intro": "Cremastra, commonly known as the moonflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to North America and includes species such as Cremastra alba, which is known for its fragrant, white flowers that bloom at night. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in woodland areas. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while the flowers are tubular and emit a sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. Cremastra is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in supporting nighttime pollinators."
