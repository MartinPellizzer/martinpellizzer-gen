    "intro": "Celtis anfractuosa, commonly known as the burr maple, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Elaeocarpaceae family and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and distinctive, winged fruits. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges and a glossy upper surface. Celtis anfractuosa produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by spiny, berry-like fruits that mature in the fall. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is valued for its ornamental bark and ecological benefits."
