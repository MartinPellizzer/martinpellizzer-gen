    "intro": "Corymbia pachycarpa subsp. glabrescens, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bloodwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, flaky bark that becomes smoother with age, and its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often glabrous or nearly so. The tree produces distinctive crimson to pink flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, urn-shaped fruits. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
