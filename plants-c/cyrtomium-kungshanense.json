    "intro": "Cyrtomium kungshanense, commonly known as the Kungshan holly fern, is a rare evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive, finely serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
