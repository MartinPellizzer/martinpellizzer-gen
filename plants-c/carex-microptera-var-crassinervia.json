    "intro": "Carex microptera var. crassinervia, commonly known as the broad-veined sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly curved, with prominent, broad veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense spikes, which are typically arranged in a single, terminal cluster. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in areas with standing water or high humidity. This variety is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wetland ecosystems."
