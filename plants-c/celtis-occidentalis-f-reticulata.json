    "intro": "Celtis occidentalis f. reticulata, commonly known as the reticulate hackberry, is a variant of the common hackberry. It is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States, characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves with a reticulated or net-like pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by small, spherical fruits that mature to a dark purple color. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in a variety of soil types and light conditions. The reticulate hackberry is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
