It is characterized by its bright yellow, flame-like inflorescences that bloom in clusters, making it a visually striking plant. The leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces long, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Caesalpinia elata thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for warm, tropical climates."
