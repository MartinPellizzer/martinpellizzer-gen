    "intro": "Clivia robusta, commonly known as the Natal lily, is a striking evergreen perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features strap-shaped, dark green leaves that are broad and glossy, often with a reddish tint along the midrib. The plant produces tall, sturdy stems that bear clusters of bright orange-red flowers, which bloom in spring and summer. Clivia robusta is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance of low light and moderate watering. Its compact size and vibrant blooms make it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardens."
