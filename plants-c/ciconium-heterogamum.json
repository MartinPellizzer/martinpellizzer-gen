    "intro": "Ciconium heterogamum, commonly known as the African waterwheel, is a unique aquatic plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves that radiate from a central stem, creating a wheel-like appearance. The plant thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are typically green and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss. Ciconium heterogamum is often used in water gardens and wetland restoration projects due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
