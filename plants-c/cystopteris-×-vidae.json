    "intro": "Cystopteris \u00d7 vidae, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a fern species that results from the cross between Cystopteris bulbifera and Cystopteris fragilis. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, organic soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses as a decorative plant."
