    "intro": "Cephalocereus tweedyanus, commonly known as the Easter cactus, is a species of cactus native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and its ability to produce vibrant, showy flowers during the Easter season, hence its common name. The plant has thick, segmented stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically red, orange, or yellow, and they bloom in clusters at the ends of the stems. The plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and ornamental value."
