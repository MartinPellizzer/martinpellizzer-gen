    "intro": "Calamagrostis pseudophragmites f. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow reedgrass, is a variant of the common reed that exhibits distinct yellowish-green foliage. It is a perennial grass native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in wetland habitats such as marshes and along riverbanks. The plant features tall, slender culms that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, flat leaves that are often tinged with yellow. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color, rather than the typical brown of the species. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in moist environments."
