    "intro": "Cyperus pennellii, commonly known as the yellow nut sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family (Cyperaceae) and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense clusters of yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a common weed and an important component of wetland ecosystems. Cyperus pennellii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
