    "intro": "Calicotome spinosa f. ponsgueraui, commonly known as the Ponsgueraui calicotome, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its thorny stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, and its seeds are enclosed in pods. It is adapted to survive in dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. This species is often used in traditional medicine and for soil stabilization in degraded landscapes."
