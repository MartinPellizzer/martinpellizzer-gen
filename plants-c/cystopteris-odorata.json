    "intro": "Cystopteris odorata, commonly known as the fragrant water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used in ornamental gardening. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near water bodies such as ponds and streams. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that give it a lacy appearance. The plant produces spores in sporangia located on the undersides of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
