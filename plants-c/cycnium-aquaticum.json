    "intro": "Cycnium aquaticum, commonly known as water hibiscus, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland areas in the Americas. It features heart-shaped, broad leaves that are typically floating or submerged, depending on the water depth. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a yellow throat. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for aquatic environments, allowing it to thrive in marshes and ponds. Cycnium aquaticum plays a role in supporting aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small aquatic organisms."
