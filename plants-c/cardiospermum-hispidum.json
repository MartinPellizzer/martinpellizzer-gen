    "intro": "Cardiospermum hispidum, commonly known as the \"velvetleaf\" or \"horse heart plant,\" is a tropical vine native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into distinctive, inflated seed pods. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it an invasive species in many regions. Botanically, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine."
