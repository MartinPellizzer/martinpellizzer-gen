    "intro": "Cornus excelsa, commonly known as the Himalayan dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its showy, white or pink bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by red or orange berries that are edible for birds. Cornus excelsa thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens in temperate climates."
