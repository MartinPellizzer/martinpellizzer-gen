    "intro": "Coveniella poecilophlebia, commonly known as the silverleaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that give it a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for many decades, making it a long-lived component of its native ecosystem. Its fronds are often used in traditional M\u0101ori basket weaving, highlighting its cultural significance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is an important indicator species for forest health."
