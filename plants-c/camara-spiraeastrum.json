    "intro": "Camara spiraeastrum, commonly known as the spiral spirea, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Camara spiraeastrum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
