    "intro": "Ctenopteris cretata, commonly known as the Cretaceous water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as streams and ponds, where it attaches to rocks or submerged substrates. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, forming dense colonies that help stabilize aquatic ecosystems. The spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds."
