    "intro": "Cyclopogon goodyeroides, commonly known as the Goodyera-like cyclopogon, is a species of flowering plant in the family Orchidaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit. The plant features lanceolate leaves with a waxy surface and produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in a terminal inflorescence. It is often found in shaded, humid environments such as cloud forests and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its unique appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species."
