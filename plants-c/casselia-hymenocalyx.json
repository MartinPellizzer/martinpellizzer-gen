It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and showy, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Casselia hymenocalyx is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
