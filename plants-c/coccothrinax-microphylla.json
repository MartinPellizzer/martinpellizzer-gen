It is native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the Bahamas and the Greater Antilles. This palm is characterized by its compact stature, with short, clustered leaves and a slender trunk. The plant thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to salt spray and sandy soils. Its small, clustered leaves and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical regions."
