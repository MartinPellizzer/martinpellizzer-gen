    "intro": "Coelogyne latiloba, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender pseudobulbs and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces showy, lance-shaped leaves that are often broader than those of other Coelogyne species. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light and well-draining soil. Coelogyne latiloba is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its elegant blooms."
