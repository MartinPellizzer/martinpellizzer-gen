It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and bark. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by oval-shaped berries. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. The bark, while not as commercially valuable as true cinnamon, is also used in some local remedies."
