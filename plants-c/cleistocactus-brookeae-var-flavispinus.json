    "intro": "Cleistocactus brookeae var. flavispinus, commonly known as the yellow-spined cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of spines that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, adding a striking contrast to its spiny exterior. It is adapted to extreme desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated in succulent gardens."
