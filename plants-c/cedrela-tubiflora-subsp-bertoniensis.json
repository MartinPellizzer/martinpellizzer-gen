    "intro": "Cedrela tubiflora subsp. bertoniensis, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and compound leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by elongated, woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered threatened in many parts of its range."
