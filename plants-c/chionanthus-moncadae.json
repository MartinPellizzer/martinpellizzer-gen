    "intro": "Chionanthus moncadae, commonly known as the Monteverde whiteflower, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is characterized by its elegant, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a striking visual element to the understory vegetation. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. Its flowers emit a subtle fragrance, attracting pollinators such as moths and bees, which play a crucial role in its reproductive cycle. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Chionanthus moncadae is considered vulnerable, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
