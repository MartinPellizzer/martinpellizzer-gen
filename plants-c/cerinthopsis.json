It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has small, compound leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Cerinthopsis is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access groundwater. Its botanical features make it an important plant in ecological studies of desert flora."
