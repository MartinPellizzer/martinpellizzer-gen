    "intro": "Cyathea antioquensis, commonly known as the Antioquia tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its fronds can grow up to several meters in length, contributing to its dramatic appearance in the understory of tropical forests. Cyathea antioquensis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various forest organisms."
