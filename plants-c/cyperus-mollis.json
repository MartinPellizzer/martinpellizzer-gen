It belongs to the sedge family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically found in dense clusters at the base of the plant. Cyperus mollis thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along water bodies. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive, upright growth habit and ability to tolerate waterlogged soil."
