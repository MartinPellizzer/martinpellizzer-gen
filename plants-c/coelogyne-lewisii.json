    "intro": "Coelogyne lewisii, commonly known as the Lewis's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters of 10 to 20 on a tall, erect stem. The plant has strap-shaped, dark green leaves and is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees rather than in soil. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light. Coelogyne lewisii is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its beauty and fragrance."
