It is characterized by its distinctive red twigs that become prominent in winter, contrasting with its bright green foliage in spring. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by blue-black berries in the fall. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and turn yellow in the autumn, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its seasonal interest and ecological benefits."
