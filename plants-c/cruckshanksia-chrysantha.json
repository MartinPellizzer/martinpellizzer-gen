    "intro": "Cruckshanksia chrysantha, commonly known as the golden flame lily, is a striking flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of vibrant yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This plant thrives in humid, well-drained soil and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for both ornamental gardens and botanical collections."
