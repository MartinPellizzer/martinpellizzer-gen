    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 sinensis var. longifolia, commonly known as the pomelo or sometimes called the shaddock, is a citrus plant characterized by its large, thick-skinned fruits. It is native to Southeast Asia and is closely related to the grapefruit and orange. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, with glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant white flowers. Its fruit is generally larger than that of common citrus fruits and can weigh several pounds. The peel is thick and contains a high amount of essential oils, making it valuable for both culinary and aromatic uses."
