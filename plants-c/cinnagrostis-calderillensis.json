    "intro": "Cinnagrostis calderillensis, commonly known as the Caldeirinha grass, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, upright stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in rocky, high-altitude environments and is adapted to cold, arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
