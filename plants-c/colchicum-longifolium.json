    "intro": "Colchicum longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often mistaken for grasses, and it produces distinctive, waxy, purple berries that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
