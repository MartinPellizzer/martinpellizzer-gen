    "intro": "Ceratostylis gracilicaulis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed horned orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are linear and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The orchid's unique floral structure includes a distinctive, horn-like spur that houses the nectar, attracting specific pollinators."
