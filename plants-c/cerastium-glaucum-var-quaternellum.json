    "intro": "Cerastium glaucum var. quaternellum, commonly known as Quaternell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the British Isles. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has hairy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Quaternell is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
