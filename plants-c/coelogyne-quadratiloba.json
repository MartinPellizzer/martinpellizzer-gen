    "intro": "Coelogyne quadratiloba, commonly known as the square-leafed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy pseudobulbs and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and white, which are arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Coelogyne quadratiloba is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
