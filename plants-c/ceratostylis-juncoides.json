    "intro": "Ceratostylis juncoides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed spider-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, elongated flower spike that bears small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and swampy areas. Its flowers are pollinated by small flies, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. Ceratostylis juncoides is a rare and endangered species, requiring specific habitat conditions for successful growth."
