    "intro": "Coryanthes leferenziorum, commonly known as the Lef\u00e8r\u00e9nz orchid, is a rare and striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Ecuador. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its large, intricate, and often colorful floral structures. The plant's flowers are specifically adapted for pollination by specific insects, particularly beetles, which crawl into the flower and become temporarily trapped. Its unique morphology includes a specialized lip that guides the pollinators and a column that facilitates pollen transfer. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Coryanthes leferenziorum is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
