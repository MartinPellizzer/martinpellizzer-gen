    "intro": "Cogswellia brandegeei, commonly known as the Brandegee's cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
