    "intro": "Caenopteris odontites, commonly known as the toothed shield fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds. Native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive toothed margin that gives it its common name. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
