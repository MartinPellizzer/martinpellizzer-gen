The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which are often hairy and covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and disturbed areas. Crepis suffruticosa is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides, where it contributes to the local biodiversity."
