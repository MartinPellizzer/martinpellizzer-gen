    "intro": "Carex fuliginosa var. misandra, commonly known as the sooty sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves that form dense clumps, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along the edges of ponds. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Due to its preference for wet conditions, it is a valuable indicator species for assessing the health of wetland ecosystems."
