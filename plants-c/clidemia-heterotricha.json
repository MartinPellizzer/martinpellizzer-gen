    "intro": "Clidemia heterotricha, commonly known as the Hawaiian ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests, and is often found in the understory of native Hawaiian forests. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, are adapted for pollination by native bees and other insects. Clidemia heterotricha plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, though it can also be invasive in certain areas."
