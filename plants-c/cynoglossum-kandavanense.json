    "intro": "Cynoglossum kandavanense, commonly known as the Kandavan bellflower, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family, characterized by its hairy stems and showy flowers. The plant produces large, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, moist climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
