    "intro": "Carex sempervirens proles firma, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that features a striking silver-white coloration on the underside of the leaves. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form compact clumps, making it an excellent ground cover in woodland gardens. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds."
