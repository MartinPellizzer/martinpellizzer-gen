    "intro": "Cyclosorus microlonchus, commonly known as the small-leaf water clover, is a species of aquatic fern native to eastern Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has small, delicate fronds that are often clustered together, forming a dense, mat-like structure. Its rhizomes help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients from the water. Cyclosorus microlonchus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
