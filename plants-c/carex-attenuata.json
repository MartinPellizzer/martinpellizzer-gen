It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, rushes, and grass-like plants. This plant typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, bogs, and wet meadows. Its leaves are linear and tapering, with a distinct sheathing base, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets.
