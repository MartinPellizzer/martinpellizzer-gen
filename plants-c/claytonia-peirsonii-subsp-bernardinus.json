    "intro": "Claytonia peirsonii subsp. bernardinus, commonly known as the Sierra fairy shrimp plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Sierra Nevada foothills of California. It features rosettes of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring, which are clustered in a loose inflorescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
