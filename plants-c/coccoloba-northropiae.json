    "intro": "Coccoloba northropiae, commonly known as the Northrop's beautyberry, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its striking clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas of forests in the southeastern United States. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy texture with a bluish-green hue."
