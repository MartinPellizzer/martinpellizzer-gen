    "intro": "Carex cryptolepis var. prolifera, commonly known as the spreading sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually green or brown, and it spreads vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a common colonizer in disturbed soils. Its adaptability to wet conditions makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
