    "intro": "Canthium oligocarpum subsp. oligocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spurge, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually narrow and elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. The subspecies is distinguished by its reduced number of flowers and smaller fruit size compared to other Canthium species."
