It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rapid growth habit and trailing stems make it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover. The species is characterized by its fibrous roots and is often found in moist, disturbed habitats."
