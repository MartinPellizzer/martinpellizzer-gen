    "intro": "Campanula verbenifolia, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems that spread along the ground. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Campanula verbenifolia is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
