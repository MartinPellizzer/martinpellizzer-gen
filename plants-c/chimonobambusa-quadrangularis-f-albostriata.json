It is characterized by its distinctive white longitudinal stripes on the culms, which contrast sharply with its dark green background. The plant is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in humid, temperate climates. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green. This ornamental bamboo is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and is valued in both traditional and modern landscaping."
