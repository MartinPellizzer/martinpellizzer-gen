    "intro": "Capriola dactylon, commonly known as the creeping grass or dactylon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with slender, wiry stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or white, followed by small, three-lobed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along waterways. Its botanical characteristics make it an adaptable and resilient species in its native habitat."
