    "intro": "Centaurea paniculata nothovar. septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern spiked knapweed, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species. It is a perennial herb with slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flower heads that are typically arranged in panicles, which are branched clusters. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant hybridization and adaptation."
