    "intro": "Coilostylis cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, preferring moist soils and full sun to partial shade. Its narrow, pointed leaves are arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are often green or brown in color. Coilostylis cuspidata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
