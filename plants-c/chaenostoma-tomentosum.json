    "intro": "Chaenostoma tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly water starwort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and marshes. The plant has a creeping rhizome system with numerous stoloniferous branches, and its leaves are floating or submersed, often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, elongated fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Due to its preference for still or slow-moving water, it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems."
