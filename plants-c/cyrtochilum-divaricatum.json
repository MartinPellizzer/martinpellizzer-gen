    "intro": "Cyrtochilum divaricatum, commonly known as the variable slipper orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a pollination trap. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, with a distinct, recurved lip that aids in attracting specific pollinators. Cyrtochilum divaricatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its exotic appearance."
