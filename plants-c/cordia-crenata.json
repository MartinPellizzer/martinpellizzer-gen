    "intro": "Cordia crenata, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Its roots and leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The tree is also valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
