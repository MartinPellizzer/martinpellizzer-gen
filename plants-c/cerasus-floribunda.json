    "intro": "Cerasus floribunda, commonly known as the Japanese flowering cherry or weeping cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its weeping habit, with branches that cascade downward, creating a graceful, ornamental appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in early spring, which bloom before the leaves emerge. Its leaves are oval, serrated, and turn vibrant shades of red or orange in the fall. Cerasus floribunda is widely cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value and is often used in landscape design."
