    "intro": "Cerastium arvense f. minus, commonly known as the lesser mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant typically thrives in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and is often found in moist environments. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is a hardy species that can spread readily through both seed dispersal and vegetative propagation."
