    "intro": "Celosia eriantha, commonly known as flame flower, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant, spiky bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers at the base of the bracts, which are often overlooked. Celosia eriantha thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and floral arrangements. Its ability to retain color for extended periods makes it a favored plant in both horticulture and floral design."
