    "intro": "Cleome tenuis subsp. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf spiderflower, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground, with small, pale green leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that resemble spiders, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
