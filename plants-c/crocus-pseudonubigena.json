    "intro": "Crocus pseudonubigena, commonly known as the alpine crocus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet or blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, spherical corms for storage and reproduction. Due to its habitat preferences, it is often found in high-altitude meadows and is adapted to cold, harsh climates."
