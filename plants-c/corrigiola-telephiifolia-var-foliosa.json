    "intro": "Corrigiola telephiifolia var. foliosa, commonly known as the broadleaf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed sites. Due to its succulent nature, it is adapted to withstand drought and salt spray, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
