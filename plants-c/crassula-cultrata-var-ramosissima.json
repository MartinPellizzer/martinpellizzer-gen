    "intro": "Crassula cultrata var. ramosissima, commonly known as the Woolly Crassula, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink during the cooler months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental leaves make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
