    "intro": "Campanopsis annularis, commonly known as the ringed bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often with a distinctive ring-like pattern near the base of the petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are often hairy as well. Campanopsis annularis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated in gardens with partial shade."
