    "intro": "Cheilanthes trichomanoides f. subnuda, commonly known as the naked fern, is a variant of the rockcap fern. It is a compact, low-growing fern that typically forms dense clusters on rocky substrates. The fronds are usually short and stout, with a pale green coloration. This fern is characterized by its reduced indusia, which are smaller and less prominent compared to the typical form. It thrives in arid environments and is often found in crevices or on exposed rock surfaces."
