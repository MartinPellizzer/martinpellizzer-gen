It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant is often found growing in moist, shaded environments, typically along riverbanks or in dense undergrowth. Its seeds are encased in long, slender pods, and the plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various insects and animals. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
