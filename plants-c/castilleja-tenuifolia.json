    "intro": "Castilleja tenuifolia, commonly known as the slenderleaf paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, red-orange to yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Castilleja tenuifolia plays a role in supporting pollinators and is often found in association with grasses and forbs in its native range."
