    "intro": "Crateria capitata, commonly known as the golden cupplant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features a rosette of broad, waxy, dark green leaves that form a dense basal cluster. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in late summer, arranged in a single, terminal inflorescence that resembles a cup. Its flowering stems are hairy and can grow up to 3 feet tall, adding vertical interest to the garden. Crateria capitata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
