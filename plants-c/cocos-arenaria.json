    "intro": "Cocos arenaria, commonly known as the sand palm, is a small, slow-growing palm native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender trunk and a crown of narrow, feather-like leaves. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. Its flowering occurs in spring, producing small, yellowish-white flowers that develop into orange fruits. The species is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience in coastal and dry landscapes."
