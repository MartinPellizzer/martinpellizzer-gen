It is a member of the Cleomaceae family, which includes various species adapted to dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and its leaves are typically narrow and succulent to reduce water loss. It has a low-growing habit, often forming dense mats to conserve moisture and withstand harsh desert conditions. The species is characterized by its ability to thrive in poor soils and extreme temperatures, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
