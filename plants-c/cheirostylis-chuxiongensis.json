    "intro": "Cheirostylis chuxiongensis, commonly known as the Chuxiong orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its botanical features include strap-like leaves and a compact inflorescence with small, clustered blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
