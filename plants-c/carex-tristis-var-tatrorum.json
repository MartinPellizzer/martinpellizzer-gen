    "intro": "Carex tristis var. tatrorum, commonly known as the Tatrow's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for cold climate ecosystems."
