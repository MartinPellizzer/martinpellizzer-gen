    "intro": "Carex aa, commonly known as the Mauna Loa sedge, is a perennial plant native to Hawaii. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. Carex aa is an important component of the native flora of Hawaii's high-elevation regions."
