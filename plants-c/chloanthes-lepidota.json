    "intro": "Chloanthes lepidota, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, velvety purple flowers. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are elliptical and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Chloanthes lepidota thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
