    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris algida, commonly known as the cold hardy common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to temperate regions. It features small, alternate, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces tiny white or pink flowers in clusters. The plant thrives in cool climates and is often found in disturbed soils, lawns, and along pathways. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread easily in new areas. This species is notable for its resilience to cold temperatures and its ability to tolerate a wide range of soil conditions."
