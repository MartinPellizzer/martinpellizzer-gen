It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking, white, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
