    "intro": "Cyphokentia robusta, commonly known as the robust cycad, is a species of cycad native to Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or sandy environments. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
