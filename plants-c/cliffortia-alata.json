It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with white ray florets, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in sandy areas. Cliffortia alata is a hardy, drought-tolerant species suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
