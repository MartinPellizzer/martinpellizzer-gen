    "intro": "Cyrtorchis arcuata subsp. whytei, commonly known as the Whyte's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pale green to white, strap-like leaves and its distinctive, showy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as pine flatwoods and scrub habitats. Its flowers, which are usually pale green or white with a slight pinkish tinge, bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
