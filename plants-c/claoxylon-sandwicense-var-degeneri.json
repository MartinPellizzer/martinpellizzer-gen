It is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Hawaiian Islands, specifically found on the island of Molokai. This variant is characterized by its unique morphology, including its slender, woody stem and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in coastal areas with well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
