    "intro": "Cleistocactus colubrinus, commonly known as the blue moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a compact, rounded shape. The plant produces vibrant blue flowers that bloom at night, hence its common name. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
