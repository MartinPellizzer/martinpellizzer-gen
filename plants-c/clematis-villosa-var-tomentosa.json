    "intro": "Clematis villosa var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full sun and prefers well-drained, fertile soil. Its vigorous growth habit makes it an excellent choice for trellises or as a ground cover in shaded areas."
