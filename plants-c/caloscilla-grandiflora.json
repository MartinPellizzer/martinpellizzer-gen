    "intro": "Caloscilla grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered caloscilla, is a striking plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters, often reaching up to 10 centimeters in diameter. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and shrublands, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Caloscilla grandiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
