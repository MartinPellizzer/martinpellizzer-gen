    "intro": "Cnicus segetum, commonly known as the field sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by spherical, spiny seed heads. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Cnicus segetum is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction."
