    "intro": "Cistanche tinctoria f. lutea, commonly known as the yellow parasitic desert candle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized roots called haustoria. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia, including China, Mongolia, and Russia. It produces yellow-orange flowers and has a fleshy, spindle-shaped stem that resembles a candle. Due to its medicinal properties, it is often used in traditional Chinese medicine."
