    "intro": "Cereus flagelliformis var. minor, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored crown, which is typically a different hue than its green, stem-like body. The plant's stem is cylindrical and segmented, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. It produces night-blooming flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, adding to its ornamental appeal. This variety is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
