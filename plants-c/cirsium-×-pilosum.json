It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It has a rosette growth habit with a mat-forming structure, and its flowers are usually visited by various pollinators.
