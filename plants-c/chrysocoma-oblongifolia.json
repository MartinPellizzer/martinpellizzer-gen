    "intro": "Chrysocoma oblongifolia, commonly known as the African rock fig, is a small shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits that turn yellow when mature. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and agroforestry systems."
