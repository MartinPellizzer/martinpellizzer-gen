    "intro": "Cistus \u00d7 ledon nothosubsp. ledon, commonly known as the hybrid rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or limestone habitats. It is closely related to other species in the Cistus genus, and its hybrid origin suggests crossbreeding between Cistus ladaniferus and Cistus \u00d7 ledon. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
