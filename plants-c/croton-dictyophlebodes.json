It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that display a vibrant mix of green, red, and yellow hues. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by orange to red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. The plant's ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural displays in warm climates."
