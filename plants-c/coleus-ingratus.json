It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers and thick, velvety leaves. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, with upright stems and clusters of tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Coleus ingratus is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
