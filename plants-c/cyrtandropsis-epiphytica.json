    "intro": "Cyrtandropsis epiphytica, commonly known as the epiphytic shrub, is a rare and specialized plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant has small, clustered leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are often white or pale pink. Its botanical structure is adapted to its unique lifestyle, with specialized root systems that absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
