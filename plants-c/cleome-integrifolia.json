    "intro": "Cleome integrifolia, commonly known as the spider flower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Cleome integrifolia is a member of the Cleomaceae family and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It is an annual plant that thrives in full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant."
