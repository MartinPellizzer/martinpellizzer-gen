    "intro": "Caladium schomburgkii, commonly known as the Schomburgk's arrowleaf, is a tropical perennial plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often with contrasting green veins. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant foliage. Caladium schomburgkii is typically grown as a houseplant or in shaded garden beds where it can flourish without direct sunlight."
