    "intro": "Cheilanthes \u00d7 gryphus, commonly known as the hybrid rock fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Cheilanthes lanuginosa and Cheilanthes tomentosa. It is a perennial fern characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in rocky or crevice habitats, thriving in arid to semi-arid environments. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and as a houseplant."
