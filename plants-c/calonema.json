    "intro": "Calonema, commonly known as the false ivy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. It consists of about 10 species, most of which are native to Southeast Asia, particularly the Philippines. The plants are typically small, herbaceous perennials with opposite, simple leaves that are often hairy. They produce small, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, usually in shades of white, blue, or purple. Calonema species are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their attractive foliage and modest flowering."
