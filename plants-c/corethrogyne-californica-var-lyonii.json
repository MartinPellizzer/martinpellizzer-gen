    "intro": "Corethrogyne californica var. lyonii, commonly known as the Lyon's corethrogyne, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of California. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in open habitats such as chaparral and grasslands. Its leaves are finely divided and have a distinctive, fern-like appearance, while its small white flowers bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
