    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 axillaris, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a hybrid sedge species native to North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wetlands, and streambanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands. Carex \u00d7 axillaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
