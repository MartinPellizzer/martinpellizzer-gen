It features slender, branching stems and elongated, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Crotalaria linearis is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. It is also valued for its role in nitrogen fixation and as a forage crop in some regions."
