    "intro": "Cereus roemeri, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are typically green and covered in small, white spines. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. These flowers are usually short-lived, lasting only a single night. Cereus roemeri is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments."
