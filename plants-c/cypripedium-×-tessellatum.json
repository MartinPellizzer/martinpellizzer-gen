    "intro": "Cypripedium \u00d7 tessellatum, commonly known as the tessellated lady's slipper, is a hybrid orchid species that exhibits a unique combination of traits from its parent species, Cypripedium calceolus and Cypripedium micranthum. It is characterized by its large, showy, slipper-shaped pouch that is often adorned with intricate patterns of green and brown. The plant typically grows in cool, moist forest habitats, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are pollinated primarily by flies and beetles. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Cypripedium \u00d7 tessellatum is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
