It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by clustered, spiny fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas and forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
