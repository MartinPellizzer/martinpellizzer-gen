    "intro": "Cyclosorus fukienensis, commonly known as the Fukien cyclosorus, is a rare and delicate fern species native to southern China. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its intricate, fan-shaped fronds with a distinctive, wavy margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
