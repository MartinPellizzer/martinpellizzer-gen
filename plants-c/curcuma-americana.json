    "intro": "Curcuma americana, commonly known as the American turmeric, is a rhizomatous plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, yellowish rhizomes. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring lance-shaped leaves and small, pale yellow flowers. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to turmeric. Botanically, it is distinguished by its unique chemical composition, including curcuminoids, which contribute to its medicinal properties."
