    "intro": "Chlamydocarya, commonly known as the whitebark pine, is a genus of coniferous trees native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its distinctive bark, which is thick and scaly, providing protection against wildfires and extreme temperatures. The cones of Chlamydocarya are serotinous, meaning they remain closed until exposed to heat, typically from a forest fire, which aids in seed dispersal. The tree produces edible seeds that are a vital food source for various wildlife species. Due to its ecological importance and vulnerability to diseases like white pine blister rust, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
