It features compact, rounded rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and ease of care, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
