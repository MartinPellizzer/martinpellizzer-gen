    "intro": "Casuarina obtusa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved she-oak, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical, scaly bark and small, needle-like leaves that are clustered in groups of three. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often forming dense thickets. Casuarina obtusa is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
