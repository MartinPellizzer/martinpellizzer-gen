    "intro": "Caprifolium quercifolium, commonly known as the oak-leaved honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that resemble those of an oak tree, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically valuable plant in forest understories."
