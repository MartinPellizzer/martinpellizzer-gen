    "intro": "Cynorkis peyrotii, commonly known as the Peyrot's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to South Africa. It is a terrestrial herb with a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its flowers are typically arranged in a raceme and bloom during the summer months. Cynorkis peyrotii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
