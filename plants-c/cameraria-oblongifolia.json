    "intro": "Cameraria oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed miner, is a small, deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by spherical, dry fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Cameraria oblongifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
