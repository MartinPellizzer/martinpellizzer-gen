    "intro": "Cymodocea, commonly known as shoalgrass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. These plants are typically found in coastal and brackish water environments, often forming dense underwater meadows. Cymodocea species are important for stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms. They play a significant role in coastal ecosystems due to their ability to thrive in saline conditions."
