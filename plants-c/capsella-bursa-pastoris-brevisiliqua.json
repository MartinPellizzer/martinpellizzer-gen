    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris brevisiliqua, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb with alternate, ovate leaves that are typically hairy and have a pointed tip. It produces small, white or pink flowers with five petals, which are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. The plant has a taproot system and is often found in disturbed soils, such as gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Its seeds are enclosed in a three-lobed capsule that opens to release tiny seeds, aiding in its widespread distribution. This species is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
