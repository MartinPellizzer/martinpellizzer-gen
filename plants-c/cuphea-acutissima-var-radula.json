It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular red bracts that surround clusters of small, white flowers. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, adding contrast to the showy bracts. It is drought-tolerant and well-suited for xeriscaping due to its ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
