It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright orange to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open coniferous forests, often associated with pine trees, and can be found in moist, well-drained soils. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Castilleja pinetorum is an important component of its ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host for various insects."
