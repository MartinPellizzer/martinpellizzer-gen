    "intro": "Clematis bergeronii, commonly known as the white clematis, is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with three to five elliptical leaflets and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pale blue. The plant thrives in partial to full sun and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its climbing habit makes it suitable for trellises or arbors, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Clematis bergeronii is relatively low maintenance but benefits from regular pruning to maintain its shape and encourage blooming."
