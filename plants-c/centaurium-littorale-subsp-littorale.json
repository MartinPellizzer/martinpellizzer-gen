    "intro": "Centaurium littorale subsp. littorale, commonly known as sea centaury, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and northern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, often hairy stems that form dense mats. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in saline environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shores and is often found in maritime climates."
