It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, featuring a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, spiny areoles and is often grown as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance. Cogswellia leibergii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
