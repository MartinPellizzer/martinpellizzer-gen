    "intro": "Castilleja salticola, commonly known as the jumping broom. It is a hemiparasitic plant found in arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. The plant has bright orange to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are reduced to small scales, and it relies on a network of root hairs to connect with neighboring plants for nutrients. Castilleja salticola plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
