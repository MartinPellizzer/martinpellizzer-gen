It features slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are composed of ray florets surrounded by tubular disc florets. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils.
