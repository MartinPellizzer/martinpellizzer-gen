    "intro": "Coronilla coronata f. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved crownvetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are larger and more elongated compared to the typical form of Coronilla coronata. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment and erosion control."
