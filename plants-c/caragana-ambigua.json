    "intro": "Caragana ambigua, commonly known as the twinleaf shrub, is a deciduous shrub native to the arctic and alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are divided into two pairs of leaflets, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are followed by pods containing several seeds. It thrives in harsh, cold environments and is often found in tundra and rocky soils. Caragana ambigua is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
