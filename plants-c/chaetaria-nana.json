    "intro": "Chaetaria nana, commonly known as the dwarf chaetaria, is a low-growing plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically has finely divided leaves and produces tiny, white or greenish flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native habitats."
