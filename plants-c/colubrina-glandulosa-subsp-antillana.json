    "intro": "Colubrina glandulosa subsp. antillana, commonly known as the Antillean bluestem, is a shrub native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal. This species is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it resilient to salt spray and wind."
