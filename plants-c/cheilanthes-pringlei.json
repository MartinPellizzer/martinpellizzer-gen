    "intro": "Cheilanthes pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's rockcap, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in dry, shaded environments. The plant has dark green, leathery fronds with a rough, scaly texture that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in low-nutrient soils. Cheilanthes pringlei is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant that is well adapted to its specific ecological niche."
