    "intro": "Corchorus acutangulus, commonly known as Chinese broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nourishment. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is native to regions of Asia, including China, India, and parts of the Middle East. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and has a fibrous root system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is often found growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
