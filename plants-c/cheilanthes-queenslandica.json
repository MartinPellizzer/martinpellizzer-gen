    "intro": "Cheilanthes queenslandica, commonly known as the Queensland lip fern, is a terrestrial fern native to Australia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Cheilanthes queenslandica is well adapted to arid conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
