    "intro": "Chenopodium neglectum, commonly known as pigweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in many regions. Chenopodium neglectum thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. It is also known for its nutritional value, as it is edible and has been used in traditional cuisines."
