It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and large, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. Its fruits are an important food source for various bird species, particularly the kerer\u016b. The tree is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in subtropical gardens."
