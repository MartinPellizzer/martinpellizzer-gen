    "intro": "Castilleja taedifera, commonly known as the redstem Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red, brush-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its roots to parasitize the roots of neighboring plants, drawing nutrients from them. Its structure consists of a short, fibrous stem with clustered, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Castilleja taedifera is often found in open, sunny habitats like grasslands and sagebrush steppe."
