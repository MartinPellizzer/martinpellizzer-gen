It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often found in freshwater habitats. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread across the surface of ponds and streams. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with small, pointed pinnae that contribute to its intricate appearance. Coryphopteris japonica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in moist environments."
