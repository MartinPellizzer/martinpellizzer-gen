It is native to northern Australia and parts of New Guinea, where it grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The tree can reach heights of up to 20 meters and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and dense, spreading crown. Its flowers are typically white or pink, arranged in clusters, and are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. The plant is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also an important component of its native ecosystems."
