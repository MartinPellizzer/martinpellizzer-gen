These plants are native to southern and eastern South America, particularly in regions like Argentina, Chile, and Brazil. Cantua species are typically herbaceous perennials with showy, bell-shaped flowers that come in shades of pink, purple, and white. They often grow in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The genus includes several species, with Cantua buchii being one of the most well-known for its ornamental value."
