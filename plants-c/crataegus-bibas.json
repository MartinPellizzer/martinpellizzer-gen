    "intro": "Crataegus bibas, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawthorn, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its small, thorny branches and oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces white or pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Crataegus bibas is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found in woodlands and scrub habitats. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds, which feed on its berries."
