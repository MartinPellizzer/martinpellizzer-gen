    "intro": "Cardiopteris, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and consists of several species, most of which are aquatic or semi-aquatic. The plants typically have long, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water's surface, with roots submerged in the water. They are often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Cardiopteris species are valued for their ornamental appearance and are sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
