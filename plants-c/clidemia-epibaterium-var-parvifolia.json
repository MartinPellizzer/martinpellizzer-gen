    "intro": "Clidemia epibaterium var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and typically grows on the branches of host trees, deriving some of its nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers and is often found in humid, shaded forest environments. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and usually have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its moist habitat. Due to its parasitic nature, it can impact the health of its host trees if left unchecked."
