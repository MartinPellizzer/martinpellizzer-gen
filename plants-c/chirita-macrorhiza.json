    "intro": "Chirita macrorhiza, commonly known as the large-rooted ivy. It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, which help it store water and nutrients. Chirita macrorhiza is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
