    "intro": "Corytholoma fragile, commonly known as the brittle coralroot, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to various regions in the northern hemisphere. This plant is notable for its lack of chlorophyll, which means it relies entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its small, pale yellow or white flowers are clustered in a spike and are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. The plant's delicate, thin stems and leaves contribute to its common name, reflecting its fragile appearance. Corytholoma fragile thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and woodlands."
