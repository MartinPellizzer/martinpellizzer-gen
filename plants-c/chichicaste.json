    "intro": "Chichicaste, commonly known as the Mexican flame vine, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its striking orange-red tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is a vigorous climber, often used in ornamental landscaping due to its showy appearance. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and can grow quite long. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural spread in the wild."
