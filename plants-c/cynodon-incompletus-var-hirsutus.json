    "intro": "Cynodon incompletus var. hirsutus, commonly known as hairy carpetgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along waterways. Its growth habit makes it a common weed in agricultural and disturbed areas."
