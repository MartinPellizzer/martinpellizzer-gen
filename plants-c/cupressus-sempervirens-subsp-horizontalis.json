    "intro": "Cupressus sempervirens subsp. horizontalis, commonly known as the creeping cypress, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, scale-like foliage that forms a mat or carpet-like appearance, making it ideal for ground cover. The plant has aromatic, needle-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
