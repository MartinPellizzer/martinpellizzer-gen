    "intro": "Craspedodictyum spathulatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces striking, yellow to orange flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, with the photosynthetic function being carried out by the stems. It is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
