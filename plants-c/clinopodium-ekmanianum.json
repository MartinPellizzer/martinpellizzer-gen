    "intro": "Clinopodium ekmanianum, commonly known as Swedish savory, is a perennial herb native to northern Europe. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs such as mint and basil. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. Its small, pink or purple flowers are arranged in whorls along the stems, and it produces small, four-lobed nutlets as fruit. Clinopodium ekmanianum is valued for its aromatic leaves and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
