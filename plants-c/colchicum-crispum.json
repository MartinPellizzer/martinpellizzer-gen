It is characterized by its striking, pale purple to lilac-colored flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often curled or crinkled, giving it its common name. It produces distinctive, helmet-shaped corms that serve as its storage organs. Colchicum crispum is typically found in rocky or woodland habitats and is known for its ornamental value in gardens."
