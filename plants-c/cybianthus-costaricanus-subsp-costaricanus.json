    "intro": "Cybianthus costaricanus subsp. costaricanus, commonly known as the Costa Rican heather, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and evergreen foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming during the wet season. It thrives in high humidity and well-drained acidic soils, often growing at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
