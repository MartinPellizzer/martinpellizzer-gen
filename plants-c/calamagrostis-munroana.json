    "intro": "Calamagrostis munroana, commonly known as Munro's reed, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers that bloom in late summer. Calamagrostis munroana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
