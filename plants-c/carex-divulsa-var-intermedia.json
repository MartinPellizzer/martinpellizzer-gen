    "intro": "Carex divulsa var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in wet to moist environments such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. The plant has grass-like leaves that are generally narrow and somewhat stiff, with a bluish-green coloration. Its flowering spikes are usually short and cylindrical, producing small, greenish flowers that are wind-pollinated. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
