    "intro": "Caxamarca, commonly known as the \"water lily of the Andes,\" is a tropical aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in lakes and ponds. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, while its leaves provide habitat for aquatic life. The Caxamarca plays an important role in local ecosystems and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
