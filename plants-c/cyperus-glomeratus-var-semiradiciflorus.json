It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its grass-like appearance and dense, clustered flowering heads. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, sandy soils. Its inflorescence consists of small, spike-like clusters of flowers, which are often greenish or brownish in color. This variant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
