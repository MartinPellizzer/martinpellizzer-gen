    "intro": "Cyperus papyrus, commonly known as the sacred reed, is a tall, herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of Egypt and parts of Africa. It has slender, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clusters, forming a tall stalk that can reach up to 5 meters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically green or brown in color. Its rhizomes are fibrous and were historically used to make papyrus paper in ancient Egypt. The plant thrives in moist, marshy environments and is often found near freshwater sources."
