    "intro": "Carduus adpressus, commonly known as the creeping thistle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and leaves that are typically lobed and covered in fine, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by spherical, bristly seed heads. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
