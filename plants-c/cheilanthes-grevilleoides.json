    "intro": "Cheilanthes grevilleoides, commonly known as the Greville's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that often grow on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. The plant's rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a leathery texture, which helps it withstand dry conditions. Cheilanthes grevilleoides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
