    "intro": "Calliandra taxifolia, commonly known as the silky calliandra, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its feathery, palmate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences of pink or red flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is often used in landscaping and soil enrichment."
