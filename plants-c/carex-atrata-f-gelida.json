It is characterized by its dark green, narrow leaves and produces spikes of small, pale brown to black flowers. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and stream banks. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The frosty sedge is adapted to cooler climates and is often associated with alpine or subalpine habitats."
