    "intro": "Cecropia adenopus var. macrophylla, commonly known as the giant ceiba, is a fast-growing, deciduous tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, providing significant shade. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers that are arranged in terminal panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its roots form extensive networks with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. This species is often found in disturbed habitats and is valued for its ecological and economic importance in tropical ecosystems."
