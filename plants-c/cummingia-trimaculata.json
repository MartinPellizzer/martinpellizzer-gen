    "intro": "Cummingia trimaculata, commonly known as the three-spotted cummingia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
