    "intro": "Crinum angolense, commonly known as the Angola arum, is a striking tropical plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy, spatulate leaves and its tall, umbel-like inflorescence that bears numerous white or pale pink flowers. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its dramatic appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Crinum angolense is also known for its strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, which is typical of many members of the Amaryllidaceae family."
