    "intro": "Cieca bilobata, commonly known as the two-lobed cieca, is a unique plant species characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. Its leaves are bilobed, meaning they are divided into two distinct lobes, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered together, followed by fruit that contains several seeds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Cieca bilobata is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
