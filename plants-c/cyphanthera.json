    "intro": "Cyphanthera, commonly known as the bluebells or false bluebells, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their delicate, often blue or purple flowers. Cyphanthera species typically grow in open, sandy or rocky soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. They have trifoliate leaves and produce small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local insect populations."
