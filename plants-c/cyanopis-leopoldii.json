    "intro": "Cyanopis leopoldii, commonly known as the Leopold's blueberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of small, blue-black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its leaves are elliptical with a smooth texture and a slight waxy coating, while its flowers are small, white, and clustered in terminal inflorescences. Cyanopis leopoldii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and other wildlife."
