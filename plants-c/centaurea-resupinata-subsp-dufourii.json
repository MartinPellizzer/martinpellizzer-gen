    "intro": "Centaurea resupinata subsp. dufourii, commonly known as the Dufour's prostrate centaurea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with purple-brown centers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and gravelly areas. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soils in marginal environments."
