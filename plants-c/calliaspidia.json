It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that resemble small cups. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, oval-shaped fruits called cypsela. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Calliaspidia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
