    "intro": "Cacalia africana, commonly known as the African bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features hairy, branched stems and heart-shaped, serrated leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
