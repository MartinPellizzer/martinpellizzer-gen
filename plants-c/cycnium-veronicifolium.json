    "intro": "Cycnium veronicifolium, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often mistaken for those of the verbena plant, hence its common name. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Cycnium veronicifolium is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
