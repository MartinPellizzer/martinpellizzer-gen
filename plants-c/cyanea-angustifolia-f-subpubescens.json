    "intro": "Cyanea angustifolia f. subpubescens, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Cyanea, is a variant of the Cyanea angustifolia species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a small shrub characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered with a fine pubescence, giving it the \"subpubescens\" designation. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forest habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant species."
