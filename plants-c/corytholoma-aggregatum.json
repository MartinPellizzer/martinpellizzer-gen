    "intro": "Corytholoma aggregatum, commonly known as the clustered coral-tongue orchid, is a species of orchid native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of dense clusters of small, coral-like flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in humid forest environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and elongated, adapted for capturing moisture from the air. The flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer, are notable for their vibrant colors and intricate structure."
