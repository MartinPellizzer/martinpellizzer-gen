It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its dense mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its frost-resistant nature. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions."
