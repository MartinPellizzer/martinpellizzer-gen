It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and forms a mat-like growth habit, often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodland floors. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging soils. Cerastium tmoleum is also known for its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
