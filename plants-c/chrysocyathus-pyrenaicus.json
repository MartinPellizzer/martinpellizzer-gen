    "intro": "Chrysocyathus pyrenaicus, commonly known as the Pyrenean yellow cup, is a rare and specialized member of the Cupressaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, yellowish-green foliage and small, cone-like structures that produce seeds. This plant is typically found in high-altitude regions of the Pyrenees, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its botanical features include needle-like leaves and a compact growth form adapted to harsh mountain conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species."
