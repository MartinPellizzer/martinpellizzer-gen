    "intro": "Cercidiphyllum, commonly known as the Katsura tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn a striking golden yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that resemble samaras. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a distinct ridged texture. Cercidiphyllum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
