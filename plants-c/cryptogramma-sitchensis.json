    "intro": "Cryptogramma sitchensis, commonly known as the Sitka cryptogramma, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and dark green, glossy leaves that are often curled when dry. Native to the coastal regions of Alaska and western Canada, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a complex life cycle involving both gametophyte and sporophyte stages. Its ability to survive in harsh, maritime conditions makes it an important indicator species for coastal ecosystems."
