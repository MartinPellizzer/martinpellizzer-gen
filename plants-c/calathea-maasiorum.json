    "intro": "Calathea maasiorum, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage with intricate patterns and a deep green background. The leaves are known to fold shut at night, a behavior called nyctinasty, which is a response to changes in light. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. It is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
