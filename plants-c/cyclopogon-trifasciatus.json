    "intro": "Cyclopogon trifasciatus, commonly known as the three-banded cyclopogon, is a species of flowering plant native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive three-banded pattern on its stem, which gives it its scientific name. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils in coastal areas and is often found in dune environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
