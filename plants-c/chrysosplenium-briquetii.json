    "intro": "Chrysosplenium briquetii, commonly known as the Briquet's golden spleenwort, is a rare and delicate member of the Saxifragaceae family. It is a small, perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. The plant features basal leaves that are usually oval to lance-shaped with a waxy surface, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring. Its botanical characteristics reflect its adaptation to cool, humid climates, and it is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
