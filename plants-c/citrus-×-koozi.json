    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 koozi, commonly known as the koozi lime, is a hybrid citrus plant originating from the intersection of the kaffir lime (Citrus hystrix) and the lemon (Citrus limon). It is characterized by its small, aromatic fruits with a distinctive bumpy, greenish-yellow rind and a high concentration of essential oils. The leaves are glossy and dark green, often with a slightly serrated edge, typical of many citrus species. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is widely cultivated for both its ornamental value and its use in culinary and aromatic applications."
