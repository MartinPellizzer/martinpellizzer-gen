    "intro": "Carex jizogatakensis, commonly known as the Jizogata sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the eastern Himalayas, specifically in countries like Bhutan and northeastern India. The plant is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous meadows and stream sides. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
