    "intro": "Cycca, commonly known as the cycad, is a primitive plant that belongs to the order Cycadales. These plants are characterized by their tall, unbranched stems and large, compound leaves that resemble ferns. Cycca species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in well-drained soils. They reproduce through cones, with separate male and female plants, and have a long evolutionary history dating back to the Mesozoic era. Due to their slow growth and unique appearance, they are often cultivated as ornamental plants."
