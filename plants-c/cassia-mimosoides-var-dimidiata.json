    "intro": "Cassia mimosoides var. dimidiata, commonly known as the red-flowered cassia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are divided into numerous small, feather-like segments. The plant produces clusters of bright red or orange-yellow flowers, which are fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for ornamental gardening. The seeds are encased in long, slender pods that split open to release the seeds when mature."
