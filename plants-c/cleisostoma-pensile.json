    "intro": "Cleisostoma pensile, commonly known as the hanging cleisostoma, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pendulous, fleshy leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique growth habit makes it a popular choice for hanging baskets or terrariums. Cleisostoma pensile is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
