    "intro": "Coleus bifidus, commonly known as the shield leaf plant, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, colorful foliage with leaves that often display shades of red, orange, and purple. The plant belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is known for its ornamental value rather than its edible properties. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped or shield-like, which gives it its scientific name \"bifidus,\" referring to the split or divided leaf edges. Coleus bifidus thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens for its vibrant appearance."
