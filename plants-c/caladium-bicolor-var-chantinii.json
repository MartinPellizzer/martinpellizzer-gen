    "intro": "Caladium bicolor var. chantinii, commonly known as the \"Chantinii\" caladium, is a tropical perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that display vibrant shades of red, pink, and white. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is the primary ornamental feature, making it a popular choice for garden displays and container planting. Caladium bicolor var. chantinii is typically grown as an annual in colder regions due to its sensitivity to frost."
