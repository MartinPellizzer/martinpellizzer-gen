    "intro": "Chartolepis, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of several species native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in countries like Peru and Bolivia. The plants are evergreen shrubs characterized by their dense, leathery foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. Chartolepis species are often found in high-altitude environments, where they thrive in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil. Due to their ornamental value and ecological significance, they are sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
