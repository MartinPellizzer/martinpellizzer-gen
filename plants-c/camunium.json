    "intro": "Camunium, commonly known as sweet flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America and parts of Europe. It has aromatic, sword-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which bloom in early summer. Camunium is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils. It is also valued for its medicinal properties, including its use in treating digestive issues and respiratory conditions."
