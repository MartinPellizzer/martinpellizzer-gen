    "intro": "Cyrtochilum scaphochilum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its evergreen foliage. The plant produces inflorescences bearing small, fragrant flowers with a distinctive greenish-white coloration. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in greenhouse settings for conservation and ornamental purposes."
