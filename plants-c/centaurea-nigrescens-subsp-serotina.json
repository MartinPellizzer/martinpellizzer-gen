    "intro": "Centaurea nigrescens subsp. serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering common centaury, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands. The plant features upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer. Its flowers are arranged in dense, conical clusters, and the species is noted for its late blooming period. The subspecies serotina is distinguished by its delayed flowering and specific habitat preferences compared to other centaury species."
