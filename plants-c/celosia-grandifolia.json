    "intro": "Celosia grandifolia, commonly known as the flame flower, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant, plume-like inflorescences that range in color from red to orange and yellow, making it a popular choice for garden displays. The plant belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is known for its upright growth habit and drought tolerance. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Celosia grandifolia thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for both container gardening and in-ground planting."
