    "intro": "Carex volcanica, commonly known as the volcanic sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Carex volcanica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
