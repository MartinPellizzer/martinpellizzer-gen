    "intro": "Cynometra mayottensis, commonly known as the Mayotte ironwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the Comoros Islands. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, greyish bark. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in coastal and lowland forest areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
