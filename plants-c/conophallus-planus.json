    "intro": "Conophallus planus, commonly known as the flat conophallus, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and produces aerial roots that help it cling to tree trunks in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
