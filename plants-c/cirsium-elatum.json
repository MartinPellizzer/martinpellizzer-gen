    "intro": "Cirsium elatum, commonly known as the tall thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, purple-blue flower heads that bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves covered in fine hairs and sharp prickles, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. Cirsium elatum thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies."
