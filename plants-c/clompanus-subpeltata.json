    "intro": "Clompanus subpeltata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved clompanus, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
