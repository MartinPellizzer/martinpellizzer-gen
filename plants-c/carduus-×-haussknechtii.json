It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flower heads that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in grasslands and along roadsides. It has a taproot system and is perennial, with a lifespan of several years. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
