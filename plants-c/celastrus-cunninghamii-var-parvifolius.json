    "intro": "Celastrus cunninghamii var. parvifolius, commonly known as the small-leaved bindweed, is a climbing vine native to eastern Australia. It features opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical variety. The plant produces yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. It is often found in forest margins and along streams, where it thrives in moist, shaded conditions."
