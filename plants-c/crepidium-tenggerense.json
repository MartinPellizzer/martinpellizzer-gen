    "intro": "Crepidium tenggerense, commonly known as the Tengger Orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the Tengger Desert of Indonesia. It is characterized by its compact, hairy stems and small, clustered greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to extreme temperature fluctuations and limited water availability. Its root system is specialized for nutrient absorption in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
