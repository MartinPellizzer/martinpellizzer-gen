    "intro": "Crepidium distans, commonly known as the distant orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its often harsh and variable habitat. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by insects. Crepidium distans is a relatively rare species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
