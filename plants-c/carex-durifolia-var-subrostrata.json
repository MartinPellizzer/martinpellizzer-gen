    "intro": "Carex durifolia var. subrostrata, commonly known as the rough-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, three-ranked flowers, which are usually green to brown in color. The leaves are stiff and covered with a dense layer of short, rough hairs, giving the plant its common name."
