    "intro": "Caraipa antioquensis, commonly known as the Antioquian caraipa, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the Andean region of Colombia. It is a herbaceous plant with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within cloud forests, where it plays a role in maintaining local biodiversity. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are critical for its survival."
