    "intro": "Coffea grevei, commonly known as the Ethiopian coffee tree, is a species native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It is a small evergreen tree that typically grows to a height of 3 to 5 meters. The plant produces small, white flowers that eventually develop into red, fleshy berries containing two seeds, which are the coffee beans. These beans are used to make coffee and are known for their unique flavor profile. Coffea grevei thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil."
