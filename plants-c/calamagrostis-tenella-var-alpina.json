    "intro": "Calamagrostis tenella var. alpina, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features narrow, silver-blue blades that form dense, mat-like clumps, often reaching heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate ornamental touch. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Its fine texture and color make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
