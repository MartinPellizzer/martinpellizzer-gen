    "intro": "Calamagrostis \u00d7 ambigua, commonly known as the blue false panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking silver-blue foliage that turns coppery in the fall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often overlooked but contribute to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its attractive appearance and ecological benefits, it is a popular choice for wetland restoration and landscaping projects."
