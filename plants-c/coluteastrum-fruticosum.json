    "intro": "Coluteastrum fruticosum, commonly known as the creeping colutea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture and produces delicate, yellowish-white flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its seeds are encased in a hairy, pod-like structure that aids in wind dispersal. While not widely cultivated, it is valued in ecological gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil."
