    "intro": "Chamaedrys pumila, commonly known as the dwarf snowberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its small, white berries that remain on the plant throughout the winter, providing food for birds and other wildlife. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with short, woody stems that spread along the ground. Its leaves are small, ovate, and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Chamaedrys pumila is adapted to harsh, cold environments and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats."
