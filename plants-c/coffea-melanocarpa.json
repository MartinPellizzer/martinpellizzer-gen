    "intro": "Coffea melanocarpa, commonly known as the black coffee bean tree, is a species native to tropical Africa. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by elongated, woody fruits containing dark brown seeds. These seeds, while not widely cultivated for commercial coffee, are sometimes used in traditional medicine. The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in both horticulture and ethnobotany."
