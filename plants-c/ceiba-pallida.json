It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and a broad, umbrella-like canopy. The tree produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Its bark is thick and fibrous, and it is often used in traditional medicine. The white ceiba is also valued for its ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
