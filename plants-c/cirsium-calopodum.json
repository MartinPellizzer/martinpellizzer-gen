    "intro": "Cirsium calopodum, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on the stems and leaves, which provides protection against herbivores and environmental stress. The plant produces purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in dry, open habitats like grasslands and rocky soils. Cirsium calopodum is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates."
