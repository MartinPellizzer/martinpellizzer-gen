    "intro": "Ctenolepis welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia, is a unique plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia and Angola. It is one of the oldest living seed plants, with a lineage dating back over 140 million years. The plant has a distinctive appearance, featuring two large, leathery leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to survive in the extreme arid conditions of its habitat. The Welwitschia is also notable for its ability to store water in its thick, spongy stems, which helps it endure long periods of drought."
