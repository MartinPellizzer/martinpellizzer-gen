It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its slender, elongated stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically arranged in racemes. It thrives in coastal areas and salt marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms. Its morphology reflects its evolutionary adaptation to high-salinity conditions."
