It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, delicate flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, allowing it to store water efficiently. Candollea calcarata is often found in open, sun-exposed habitats such as coastal dunes and dry grasslands."
