    "intro": "Crotalaria subcapitata subsp. subcapitata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cowpea, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in certain areas."
