    "intro": "Curculigo janarthanamii, commonly known as the Janarthanan's arrowhead, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is characterized by its unique floral structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate light for photosynthesis. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a distinctive arrowhead shape that gives it its common name. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
