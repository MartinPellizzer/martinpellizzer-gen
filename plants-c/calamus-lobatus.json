It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several feet in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in branched clusters, followed by fibrous, palm-like fruits. Its rhizomes are often harvested for their starchy roots, which are used in traditional medicine and as a food source. The plant thrives in wet, swampy habitats and is native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands."
