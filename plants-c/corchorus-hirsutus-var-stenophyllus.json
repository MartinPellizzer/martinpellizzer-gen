    "intro": "Corchorus hirsutus var. stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf jute, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale green to yellow flowers. The plant produces fibrous capsules that contain numerous small, smooth seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its fibrous characteristics, it has been used traditionally for textile production and soil stabilization."
