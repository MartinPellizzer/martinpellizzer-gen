    "intro": "Carpanthus axillaris, commonly known as the silver leaf grass, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is widely cultivated in Mediterranean climates."
