    "intro": "Cynanchum leptophyllum, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which is known for its distinctive milkweed-like characteristics. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and opposite, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Cynanchum leptophyllum is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
