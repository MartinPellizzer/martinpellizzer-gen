    "intro": "Cyperus tribrachiatus, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features grass-like leaves and produces distinctive, umbrella-shaped clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in moist environments. Cyperus tribrachiatus is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive appearance and adaptability."
