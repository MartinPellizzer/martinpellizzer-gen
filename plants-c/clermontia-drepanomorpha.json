It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of white to pale pink flowers with five petals, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forests and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
