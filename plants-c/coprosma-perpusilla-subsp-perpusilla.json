    "intro": "Coprosma perpusilla subsp. perpusilla, commonly known as the silver coprosma, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine silvery or greyish pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which are followed by bright red berries that persist into winter. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in horticulture for its compact form and seasonal color changes."
