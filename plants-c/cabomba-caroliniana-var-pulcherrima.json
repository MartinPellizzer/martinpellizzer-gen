    "intro": "Cabomba caroliniana var. pulcherrima, commonly known as the fragrant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, often with a waxy texture and a subtle fragrance. The plant produces showy, white to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread through vegetative propagation in aquatic environments. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater, making it a popular choice for ornamental ponds and wetlands."
