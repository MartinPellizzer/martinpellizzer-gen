    "intro": "Ceratophyllum submersum subvar. muticum, commonly known as the spiked watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and small, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that are often submerged, contributing to its role in aquatic ecosystems. It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, impacting water quality and native plant communities."
