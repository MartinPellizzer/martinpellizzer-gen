    "intro": "Campanula rotundifolia subsp. linifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are round or kidney-shaped, with hairy surfaces, and produces bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The subspecies is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and smaller, more rounded leaves compared to the typical form of Campanula rotundifolia."
