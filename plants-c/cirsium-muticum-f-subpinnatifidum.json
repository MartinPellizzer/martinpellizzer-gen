    "intro": "Cirsium muticum f. subpinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thistle, is a variant of the common thistle with distinctive botanical features. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flower heads. The leaves are typically narrower and more deeply divided compared to the typical form, giving it a more refined appearance. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. The plant is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
