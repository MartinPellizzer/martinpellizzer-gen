    "intro": "Chlaenosciadium gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's chlaenosciadium, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its umbel-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30-60 centimeters and features finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its small white or greenish flowers appear in late spring, and it is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
