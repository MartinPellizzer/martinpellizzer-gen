    "intro": "Cousinia gnezdilloi, commonly known as the Gnezdilloi cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, arid environments. The plant features small, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in late summer, adding a striking visual element to its habitat. It is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor, rocky soils, making it a resilient species in alpine and steppe ecosystems. Cousinia gnezdilloi plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native range."
