    "intro": "Ctenitis blepharochlamys, commonly known as the veined tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive veining pattern that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The plant's slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular ornamental species in horticulture."
