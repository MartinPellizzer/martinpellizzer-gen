    "intro": "Claoxylon hirsutellum, commonly known as the hirsute tallowwood, is a tropical tree native to northern Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in wet, tropical climates and is often found in rainforests or along riverbanks. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used traditionally for construction and tool-making."
