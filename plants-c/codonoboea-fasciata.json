    "intro": "Codonoboea fasciata, commonly known as the striped morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with distinct white or pale green markings. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often appearing in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is often considered a problematic weed in some areas."
