    "intro": "Calophyllum palustre, commonly known as swamp calophyllum, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of yellowish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain a single seed, which is encased in a hard, spiky shell. It thrives in moist, swampy soils and is often found in mangrove ecosystems. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its native habitats."
