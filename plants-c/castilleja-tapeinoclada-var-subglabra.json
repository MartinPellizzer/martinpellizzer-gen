    "intro": "Castilleja tapeinoclada var. subglabra, commonly known as the smoothleaf Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has reduced leaves and relies on root connections to host plants for nutrients, making it a partial parasite. Its stems are usually unbranched and can grow up to 30 centimeters in height. This species is often found in open, disturbed sites such as grasslands and woodland edges."
