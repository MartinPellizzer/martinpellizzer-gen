    "intro": "Commiphora simplicifolia, commonly known as the simple-leaf myrrh tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces a resinous sap that has been historically used in traditional medicine and incense. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically greenish-yellow and borne in clusters. The plant is adapted to arid environments and has a slow growth rate, making it a valuable but rare species in its native habitat."
