    "intro": "Ceratozamia microstrobila, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a tropical plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its seeds are enclosed in a fibrous, fleshy sarcotesta, which is an important part of its reproductive cycle. Due to its slow growth and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
