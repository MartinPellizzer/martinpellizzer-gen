    "intro": "Cremanthodium ellisii var. ellisii, commonly known as the Ellis's cremanthodium, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the western United States. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
