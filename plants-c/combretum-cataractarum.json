    "intro": "Combretum cataractarum, commonly known as the water combretum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptical in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as along riverbanks and in swampy areas."
