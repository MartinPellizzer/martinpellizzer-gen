    "intro": "Cryptantha denticulata, commonly known as the toothed cryptantha, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and the pods that develop after flowering are slender and often hairy. Cryptantha denticulata is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
