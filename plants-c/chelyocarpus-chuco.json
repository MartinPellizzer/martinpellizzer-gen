    "intro": "Chelyocarpus chuco, commonly known as the mangrove apple, is a small evergreen tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers followed by fleshy, red berries that are edible for humans and animals. It thrives in brackish water environments and plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems. Its unique adaptations to saline conditions make it a key species in mangrove forests."
