    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum mundulum, commonly known as the moonflower orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its large, waxy petals that resemble moonlight, hence its common name. It produces fragrant, night-blooming flowers that attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, Cirrhopetalum mundulum is considered a botanical wonder and a subject of scientific interest."
