    "intro": "Chorizema varium f. chandleri, commonly known as the Chandler's chori, is a rare botanical variant native to specific regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its unique, daisy-like inflorescence. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
