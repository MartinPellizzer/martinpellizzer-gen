    "intro": "Cordiofontis flexuosa, commonly known as the wandering heart fern, is a delicate, epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features slender, arching fronds that are often adorned with small, delicate sori on the underside of the leaves. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil to prevent root rot. Its unique, heart-shaped fronds give it a distinctive appearance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Cordiofontis flexuosa is valued for its ornamental beauty and air-purifying qualities."
