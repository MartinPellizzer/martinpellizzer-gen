    "intro": "Crotalaria nubica, commonly known as the rock crotalaria, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that are often surrounded by leaf-like bracts. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and are covered in fine hairs. Crotalaria nubica is adapted to survive in poor soil conditions and can thrive in areas with limited water availability."
