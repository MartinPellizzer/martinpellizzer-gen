    "intro": "Cousinia brevicaulis, commonly known as the short-stemmed globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the western United States. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense clusters of yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves and a short, sturdy stem, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Cousinia brevicaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid landscapes."
