    "intro": "Cordyla pinnata, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and Southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody pods containing flat, edible seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a significant resource in local economies. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered in many regions."
