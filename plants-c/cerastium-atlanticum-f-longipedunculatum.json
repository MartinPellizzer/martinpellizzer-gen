    "intro": "Cerastium atlanticum f. longipedunculatum, commonly known as the Atlantic chickweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northeastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial with small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features slender, hairy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its inflorescence consists of elongated peduncles bearing clusters of flowers, which is a distinguishing characteristic of this form. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds along the coastline."
