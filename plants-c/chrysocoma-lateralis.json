    "intro": "Chrysocoma lateralis, commonly known as the narrowleaf chrysocoma, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
