    "intro": "Cacalia tournefortioides, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with hairy stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water conservation. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. The flowers are followed by small, rounded seed pods that disperse seeds via the wind."
