    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis gemelliflora, commonly known as the mountain ironwood, is a species of evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its hard, dense wood. The plant produces small, cupule-enclosed nuts that are typically dispersed by animals. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in mountainous regions with high humidity. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is considered a valuable but vulnerable species in its native habitat."
