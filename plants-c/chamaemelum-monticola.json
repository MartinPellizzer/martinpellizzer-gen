    "intro": "Chamaemelum monticola, commonly known as mountain everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. Chamaemelum monticola is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
