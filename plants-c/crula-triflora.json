    "intro": "Crula triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered crula, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing herb with small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters of three, giving it its common name. The plant typically has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands or stream banks. Crula triflora is known for its delicate appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes. It plays a minor role in local ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
