    "intro": "Carex macrostylos var. guthnickiana, commonly known as Guthnick's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. This variety is distinguished by its larger, more prominent floral bracts compared to the typical form of Carex macrostylos."
