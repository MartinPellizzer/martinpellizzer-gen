    "intro": "Colchicum polyphyllum, commonly known as the meadow colchicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a bulbous corm that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically in late summer. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, forming a basal rosette that helps conserve moisture. Colchicum polyphyllum is part of the Colchicaceae family and is known for its toxic properties, containing colchicine, a compound with medicinal and research applications."
