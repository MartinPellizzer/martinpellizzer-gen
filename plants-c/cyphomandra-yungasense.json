It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are similar in appearance to passionfruit but have a distinct, aromatic flavor. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, and its flowers are typically white with a purple throat. The fruit is often used in local cuisines and has potential for cultivation as a specialty crop."
