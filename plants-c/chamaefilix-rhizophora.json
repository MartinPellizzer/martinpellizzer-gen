    "intro": "Chamaefilix rhizophora, commonly known as the mangrove fern, is a unique plant adapted to saline environments. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its ability to thrive in coastal areas with high salt content. The plant has a rhizome-based structure that allows it to anchor firmly in tidal zones. Its fronds are typically leathery and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This species plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
