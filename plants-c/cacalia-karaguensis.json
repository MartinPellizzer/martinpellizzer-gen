    "intro": "Cacalia karaguensis, commonly known as the Karaguan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and is commonly known as the sunflower family. The plant features showy, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native arid environment. Cacalia karaguensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
