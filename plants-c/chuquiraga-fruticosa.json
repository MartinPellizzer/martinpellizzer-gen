    "intro": "Chuquiraga fruticosa, commonly known as the Andean bur plant, is a shrub native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive, hooked bracts that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, temperate climates. Chuquiraga fruticosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
