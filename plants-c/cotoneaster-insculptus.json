    "intro": "Cotoneaster insculptus, commonly known as the sculpted cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, red berries that are clustered in groups of three, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its unique foliage and seasonal color changes, it is valued for its aesthetic appeal in landscape design."
