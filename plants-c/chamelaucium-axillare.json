    "intro": "Chamelaucium axillare, commonly known as the coastal banksia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that typically bloom in winter and spring. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid or coastal habitat. It produces small, woody follicles that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Chamelaucium axillare is well adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden environments, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems."
