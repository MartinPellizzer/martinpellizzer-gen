    "intro": "Corynophallus afzelii, commonly known as the giant puffball, is a large, non-photosynthetic fungus that belongs to the family Lepiota. It is characterized by its massive, white, fleshy cap that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter, with a thick, spongy stem. The fungus lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on decomposing organic matter for nutrients. It is typically found in grassy areas and is often mistaken for edible mushrooms due to its appearance. However, it is not edible and can be toxic if consumed."
