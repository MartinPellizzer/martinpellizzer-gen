    "intro": "Calanthe padangensis, commonly known as the Padang orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces a single, showy inflorescence with several flowers, each featuring three sepals and three petals, typically in shades of white and pink. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Calanthe padangensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
