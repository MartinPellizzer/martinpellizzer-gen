It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its climbing habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by distinctive, inflated fruit pods. Its leaves are typically elongated and have a prominent midrib, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Cocculus lonchophyllus is often cultivated for its foliage rather than its flowers."
