    "intro": "Celastrus stylosus var. puberulus, commonly known as the pubescent staff-vine, is a climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and borne in clusters, while the fruit is a fleshy, orange-red capsule that splits open to release seeds. It thrives in moist, wooded habitats and is often found in the understory of forests. The plant has smooth, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in length, and its leaves are usually covered in fine pubescence."
