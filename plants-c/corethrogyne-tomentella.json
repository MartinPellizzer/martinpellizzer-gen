    "intro": "Corethrogyne tomentella, commonly known as the woolly corethrogyne, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers its stems and leaves, providing a unique texture and appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it access water from deeper soil layers. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
