    "intro": "Canthium puberulum, commonly known as the hairy spurge or hairy bladderpod, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, a typical feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. Canthium puberulum produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals."
