    "intro": "Cocos nucifera var. subcandida, commonly known as the dwarf coconut palm, is a variety of the coconut tree characterized by its smaller stature and unique foliage. It features narrow, feather-like leaves that are typically lighter in color compared to the standard coconut palm. The plant produces coconuts that are smaller and have a thinner husk, making them distinct from the typical coconut variety. It thrives in tropical climates and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal. This variant is also valued for its resilience to coastal conditions and salt spray."
