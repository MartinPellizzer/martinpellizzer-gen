    "intro": "Crepidomanes paucinervium, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy, often blue or purple flowers. The plant has a creeping stem system with numerous short, erect branches that bear the flowers. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Crepidomanes paucinervium is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with limited moisture availability."
