    "intro": "Ceanothus dentatus, commonly known as the Coast Daisybush, is a shrub native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It features bright blue to purple flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Ceanothus dentatus plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
