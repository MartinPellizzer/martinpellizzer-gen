    "intro": "Colletia valenzuela, commonly known as the Valenzuela's candelabra cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its branched, cylindrical stems that form a candelabra-like structure. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in its harsh environment. Colletia valenzuela is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems."
