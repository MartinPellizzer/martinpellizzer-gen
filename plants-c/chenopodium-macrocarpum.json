    "intro": "Chenopodium macrocarpum, commonly known as lambsquarters, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, and its seeds are enclosed in small, bead-like fruits. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Chenopodium macrocarpum is considered a weed but is also a food source for various wildlife species."
