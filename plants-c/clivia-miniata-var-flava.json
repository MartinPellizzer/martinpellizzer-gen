It features strap-like, dark green leaves that are broad and lance-shaped, providing a lush backdrop for its vibrant yellow flowers. The flowers are tubular and clustered in loose inflorescences, blooming in spring and early summer. This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance of low light and moderate watering.
