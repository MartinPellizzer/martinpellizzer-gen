    "intro": "Cyanothamnus acanthocladus, commonly known as the coastal bluebottle, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often near the shoreline. The plant produces striking blue or violet flowers that are clustered in dense, showy inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy texture, and it is well adapted to salt-laden environments. Cyanothamnus acanthocladus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
