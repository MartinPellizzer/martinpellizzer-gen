    "intro": "Chamaecrista mississippiensis, commonly known as Mississippi burrbean, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow to reddish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces distinctive, spiny seed pods that remain on the plant throughout the winter, providing structural interest. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open woodlands and along roadsides. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it beneficial for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
