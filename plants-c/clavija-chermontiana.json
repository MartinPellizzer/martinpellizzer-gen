    "intro": "Clavija chermontiana, commonly known as the Chermontian clavija, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or along riverbanks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers range in color from white to pale yellow. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
