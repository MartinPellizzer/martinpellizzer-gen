    "intro": "Citrus \u00d7 aurantium var. ilicifolia, commonly known as the sour orange, is a citrus plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, yellow-orange fruits that are typically used for their high acidity in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant has dark green, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. It produces fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. The sour orange is often used as a rootstock for other citrus varieties due to its hardiness and disease resistance."
