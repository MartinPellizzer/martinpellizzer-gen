It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves, which are often lobed and have a velvety texture. The flowers are small and clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Cardiochlaena species are typically found in moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partially sunny conditions."
