    "intro": "Cyperus inselbergensis, commonly known as the rock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often found on inselbergs, which are isolated rock formations. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions and has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize the soil. Cyperus inselbergensis plays a role in preventing soil erosion in its native habitats."
