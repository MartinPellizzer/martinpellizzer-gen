    "intro": "Crocus indivisus, commonly known as the dwarf crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, showy flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its hardiness and early blooming habit, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
