    "intro": "Campanula cervicaria var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, white flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of soft, grayish-white hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or woodland environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, ethereal blooms."
