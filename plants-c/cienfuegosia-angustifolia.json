    "intro": "Cienfuegosia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cienfuegosia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and humid conditions. It is often found in the understory of tropical dry forests and is valued for its ornamental qualities. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
