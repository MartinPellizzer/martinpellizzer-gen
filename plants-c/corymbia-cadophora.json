    "intro": "Corymbia cadophora, commonly known as the slender bloodwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey to white bark that peels in thin, vertical strips. The tree produces striking red or pink flowers in clusters during the wet season, which attract a variety of pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. Corymbia cadophora is often found in coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
