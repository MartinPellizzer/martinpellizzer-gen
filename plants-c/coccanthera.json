    "intro": "Coccanthera, commonly known as the white-flowered cress, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are small annual herbs with alternate, pinnately divided leaves. The flowers are typically small, white or yellow, and arranged in racemes, attracting various pollinators. These plants thrive in moist, temperate climates and are often found in disturbed soils or along streambanks. Their seed pods are usually siliques, which split open to release the seeds when mature."
