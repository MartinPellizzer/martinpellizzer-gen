It is characterized by its clusters of small, bright red berries that mature in the fall. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. The berries are not only ornamental but also serve as a food source for birds and small mammals."
