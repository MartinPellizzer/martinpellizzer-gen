    "intro": "Clavulium pedunculosum, commonly known as the clustered false indigo, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of blue to purple flowers in late spring, which are clustered in peduncles, giving it its scientific name. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in woodland edges and open wetlands, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
