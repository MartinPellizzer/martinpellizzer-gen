    "intro": "Commiphora buraensis, commonly known as the Bura myrrh tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes frankincense and myrrh-producing plants. The plant is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and aromatic resinous exudates that have been used traditionally for medicinal and incense purposes. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in humid, tropical climates. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
