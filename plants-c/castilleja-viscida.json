    "intro": "Castilleja viscida, commonly known as the sticky castilleja, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces showy, red-orange or yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a sticky substance, which helps in deterring herbivores. Castilleja viscida is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges."
