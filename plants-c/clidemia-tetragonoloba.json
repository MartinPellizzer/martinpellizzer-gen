    "intro": "Clidemia tetragonoloba, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and thickets. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems."
