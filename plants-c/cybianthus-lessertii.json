    "intro": "Cybianthus lessertii, commonly known as the Lessert's cybianthus, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, showcasing a unique adaptation to its arid environment. Its flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets, with the central disk being particularly dense and vibrant. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Cybianthus lessertii is considered a species of conservation concern."
