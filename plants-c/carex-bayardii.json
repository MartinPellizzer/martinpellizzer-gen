    "intro": "Carex bayardii, commonly known as Bayard's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in full to partial sunlight. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late spring to early summer, produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex bayardii plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
