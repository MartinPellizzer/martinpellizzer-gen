    "intro": "Ctenitis bullescens, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, tree-like fronds that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant has a thick, fibrous trunk that supports its expansive crown of feathery leaves. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Ctenitis bullescens thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in rainforests and along riverbanks."
