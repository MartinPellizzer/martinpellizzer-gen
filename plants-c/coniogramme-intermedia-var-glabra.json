    "intro": "Coniogramme intermedia var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth coniogramme, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically glabrous, meaning they lack hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological studies and native plant gardens."
