    "intro": "Conyza varthemioides, commonly known as the common weed or goatweed, is an annual flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. It produces numerous small seeds that are easily dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in certain regions. The species is native to Africa but has spread to various parts of the world, including Asia and the Americas."
