    "intro": "Calanthe mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican calanthe, is a terrestrial orchid native to the highlands of Mexico. It features a rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces upright spikes bearing white to pale purple flowers with three sepals and three petals, often with a distinctive lip. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in shaded forest understories. Calanthe mexicana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in specialty gardens."
