    "intro": "Claoxylon samoense, commonly known as the Samoan ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the islands of Samoa and nearby Pacific regions. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Claoxylon samoense is often found in coastal and lowland forests, where it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
