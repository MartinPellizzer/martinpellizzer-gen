    "intro": "Chlora serotina var. balearica, commonly known as the Balearic chlora, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the Balearic Islands. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in shaded, moist habitats. Its delicate structure and limited distribution make it an important subject for botanical study and conservation efforts. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful management to ensure its survival."
