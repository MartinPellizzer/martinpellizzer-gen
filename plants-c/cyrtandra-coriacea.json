    "intro": "Cyrtandra coriacea, commonly known as the rough cyrtandra, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that give it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale purple, often clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests, and is often found growing on rocky or clayey soils. Cyrtandra coriacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
