    "intro": "Crepidium gibbosum, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, hairy stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for nutrient uptake. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
