    "intro": "Corymbia ptychocarpa subsp. aptycha, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often grey-green in color. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in loose groups, typically in late winter to early spring. Its bark is smooth and pale, often with a flaky or peeling appearance. This subspecies is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient and drought-tolerant species."
