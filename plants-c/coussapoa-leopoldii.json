It is a succulent cactus characterized by its cylindrical stem and dense clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows at high elevations, often in rocky or well-drained soil. It has adapted to the harsh climate with thick, fleshy stems that store water. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
