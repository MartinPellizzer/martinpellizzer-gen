    "intro": "Cardamomum uliginosum, commonly known as the bog cardamom, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wet, marshy environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It features erect, slender stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom during the wet season. Its aromatic seeds, enclosed in three-lobed pods, are used in traditional medicine and as a spice. Cardamomum uliginosum thrives in poorly drained soils and requires high humidity for optimal growth."
