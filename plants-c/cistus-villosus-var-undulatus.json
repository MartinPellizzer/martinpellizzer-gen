    "intro": "Cistus villosus var. undulatus, commonly known as the undulating hairy rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its grayish-green, softly hairy leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to arid environments. Its aromatic leaves release a resinous scent when crushed, a trait common among many Cistus species. This variety is often found in coastal and mountainous areas, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
