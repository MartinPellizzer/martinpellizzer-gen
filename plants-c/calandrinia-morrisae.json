    "intro": "Calandrinia morrisae, commonly known as the Morris's portulaca, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Portulacaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, pink, and orange. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Calandrinia morrisae is often found in rocky soils and is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
