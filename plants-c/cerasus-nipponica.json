    "intro": "Cerasus nipponica, commonly known as the Japanese cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its showy, pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, preceding the foliage. The plant produces small, sweet berries that are edible but not widely cultivated for consumption. It thrives in temperate climates and is often used in ornamental horticulture. The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and wildlife."
