    "intro": "Cleistocactus smaragdiflorus var. flavispinus, commonly known as the yellow-spined green-flowered cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, a feature that aids in pollination by nocturnal insects. Its spines are yellowish in color, giving it its common name, and it is well adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions. This cactus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
