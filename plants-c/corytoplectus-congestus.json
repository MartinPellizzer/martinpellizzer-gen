    "intro": "Corytoplectus congestus, commonly known as the dense cluster sponge, is a marine sponge belonging to the family Spongiidae. It is characterized by its dense, compact structure and is typically found in shallow coastal waters. The sponge has a rough, calcareous skeleton composed of spicules, which provide structural support. It plays an important role in marine ecosystems by filtering water and providing habitat for small organisms. Its distribution is mainly in the Atlantic Ocean, particularly around the coasts of Europe and North America."
