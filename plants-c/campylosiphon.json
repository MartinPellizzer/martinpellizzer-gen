    "intro": "Campylosiphon, commonly known as the \"tongue fern,\" is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, tongue-shaped fronds that are often drooping or arching. The plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky areas. They have rhizomes that spread horizontally, allowing them to colonize new areas. Campylosiphon species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens."
