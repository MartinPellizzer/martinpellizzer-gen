It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that resemble stars. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are elliptical and arranged in a rosette, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Coelogyne stella is prized in horticulture for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
