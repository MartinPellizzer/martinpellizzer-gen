    "intro": "Cheilanthes vestita, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a terrestrial fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in desert environments. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. Cheilanthes vestita is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species."
