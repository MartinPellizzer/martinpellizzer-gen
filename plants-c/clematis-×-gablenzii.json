    "intro": "Clematis \u00d7 gablenzii, commonly known as the Gabelnzii Clematis, is a hybrid plant that combines traits from its parent species, typically Clematis viticella and Clematis lanuginosa. It is a vigorous climber with long, flexible stems that can reach lengths of up to 20 feet, making it ideal for trellises or arbors. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is dark green and dense, providing a lush backdrop to the blossoms. Clematis \u00d7 gablenzii thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
