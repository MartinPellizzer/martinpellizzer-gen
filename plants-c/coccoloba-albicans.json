    "intro": "Coccoloba albicans, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a flowering plant species native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as coastal areas and mangrove swamps. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink and are clustered in small inflorescences. The fruit is a small, round drupe that contains a single seed, aiding in its dispersal by water or animals."
