    "intro": "Ceropegia cumingiana, commonly known as the African violet or the string of hearts, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green or white, with a unique structure that resembles a bird's beak. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a houseplant."
