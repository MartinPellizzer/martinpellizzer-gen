It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or near freshwater sources. Its intricate leaf patterns and ability to stabilize soil make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
