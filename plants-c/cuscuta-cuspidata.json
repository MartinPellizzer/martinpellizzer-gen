    "intro": "Cuscuta cuspidata, commonly known as the common dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive appearance with its thread-like, yellowish stems that wrap around its host. The plant is widespread in temperate regions and can parasitize a variety of plants, including crops and ornamentals. Its life cycle involves germination, attachment to a host, and the formation of specialized structures called haustoria to extract nutrients. Despite its parasitic nature, Cuscuta cuspidata plays a role in ecological systems by influencing plant community dynamics."
