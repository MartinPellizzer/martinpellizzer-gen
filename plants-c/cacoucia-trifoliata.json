It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet being oval-shaped with a slightly hairy surface.

Its growth habit is typically herbaceous, with a climbing or trailing structure that allows it to thrive in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
