    "intro": "Convolvulus blanchetii, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial that produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has a climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend structures or other vegetation. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. The flowers open in the morning and close by midday, adapting to the hot desert environment."
