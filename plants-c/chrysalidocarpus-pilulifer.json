    "intro": "Chrysalidocarpus pilulifer, commonly known as the pandanus palm, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into spiky, round fruits called \"pilulifer\" or \"pili nuts.\" These fruits are edible and contain a nutritious seed kernel. The plant is well adapted to coastal and wetland environments, thriving in humid, saline conditions."
