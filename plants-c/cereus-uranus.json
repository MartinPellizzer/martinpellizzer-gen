    "intro": "Cereus uranus, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a striking plant with a unique botanical structure. It is a hybrid of two different cactus species, combining the vibrant colors of the Hylocereus genus with the hardy root system of the Cereus genus. The plant features a swollen, segmented stem that stores water, typical of cacti adapted to arid environments. Its flowers are large, showy, and typically appear at night, adding to its dramatic appearance. Despite its ornamental appeal, it requires careful watering and well-draining soil to thrive."
