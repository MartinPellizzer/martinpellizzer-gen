    "intro": "Carduus colchicus, commonly known as the greater thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with a rosette of basal leaves. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, and it produces achene seeds that are dispersed by wind. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including meadows and roadsides."
