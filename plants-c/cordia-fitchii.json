    "intro": "Cordia fitchii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a shrub or small tree native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often blooming in summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Cordia fitchii is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species."
