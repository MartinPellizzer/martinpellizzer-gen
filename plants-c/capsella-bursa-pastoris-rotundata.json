    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris rotundata, commonly known as the common chickweed, is a low-growing annual plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers with four petals, which are followed by rounded, bladder-like seed pods. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it a common weed in many regions."
