    "intro": "Crepis \u00d7 curiensis, commonly known as the meadow crabgrass, is a hybrid species within the genus Crepis, belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and basal leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces small, yellow flower heads that are typically arranged in clusters, with ray florets that are usually shorter than the disk florets. It is commonly found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Its hybrid origin suggests it may result from crosses between different species of Crepis, contributing to its adaptability and variability."
