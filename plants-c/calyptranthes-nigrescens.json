It typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the understory of tropical forests. The plant features elliptical, dark green leaves that turn a deep blackish hue when mature, giving it its common name. Its small, fragrant white flowers are borne in clusters and bloom during the wet season. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
