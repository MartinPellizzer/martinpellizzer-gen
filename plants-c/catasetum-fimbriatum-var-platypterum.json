    "intro": "Catasetum fimbriatum var. platypterum, commonly known as the flat-winged cattleya, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are unique for their specialized structure, which includes a modified lip that aids in pollination by specific insects. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
