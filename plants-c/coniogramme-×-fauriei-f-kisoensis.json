    "intro": "Coniogramme \u00d7 fauriei f. kisoensis, commonly known as the Kiso conifer, is a rare and ornamental evergreen shrub native to Japan. It belongs to the family Cupressaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green foliage. The plant features scale-like leaves that are tightly packed along the stems, giving it a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. It is typically found in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
