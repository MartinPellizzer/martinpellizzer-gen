    "intro": "Cynanchum leucanthum subsp. elongatum, commonly known as the long-stalked milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry environments through deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area. This species is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils in degraded landscapes."
