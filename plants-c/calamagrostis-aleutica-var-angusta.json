    "intro": "Calamagrostis aleutica var. angusta, commonly known as narrowleaf cottongrass, is a perennial grass native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and dense clusters of fluffy, white or pale pink seed heads that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy habitats and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its narrow leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This species is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
