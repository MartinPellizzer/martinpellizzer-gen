    "intro": "Carex ferruginea f. spadicea, commonly known as the red-stemmed sedge, is a variant of the common sedge species Carex ferruginea. It is characterized by its reddish-brown stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. This plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, wetlands, and along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are usually pale green to brown in color. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
