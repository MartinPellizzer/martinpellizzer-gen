    "intro": "Cinchona peruviana var. vera, commonly known as the Peruvian quinine tree, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its evergreen, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant produces dark red, egg-shaped berries that contain the seeds. It is particularly noted for its high concentration of quinine, a compound historically used in the treatment of malaria. This variety is often cultivated for both its medicinal properties and ornamental value."
