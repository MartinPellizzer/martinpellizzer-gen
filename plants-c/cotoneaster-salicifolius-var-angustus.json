    "intro": "Cotoneaster salicifolius var. angustus, commonly known as narrowleaf cotoneaster, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, arching stems that bear opposite, elliptical leaves with a pointed tip and a finely toothed margin. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by red-orange berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and persistent berries, which add visual interest throughout the year."
