    "intro": "Clerodendrum cuneiforme, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a flowering shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, papery bracts that resemble small lanterns, which are often brightly colored in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered within the bracts, and it is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. Its leaves are typically ovate to lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it prefers well-drained soil and full sun. Clerodendrum cuneiforme is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
