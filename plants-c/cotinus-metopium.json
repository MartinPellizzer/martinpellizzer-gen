    "intro": "Cotinus metopium, commonly known as the smoke bush, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking, feathery panicles that turn from pink to red in the fall, giving it a smoky appearance. The plant has simple, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by red, fluffy fruits. Cotinus metopium thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental landscaping for its vibrant fall color."
