It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss. The flowers, which are pale yellow to greenish-white, are adapted for pollination by insects."
