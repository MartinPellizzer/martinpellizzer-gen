    "intro": "Crocus bertiscensis, commonly known as the Bertiscensis crocus, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with a distinctive, intricate pattern on the petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
