It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellowish-green foliage and yellow flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer. Chrysothamnus attenuatus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
