It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with short petioles and showy, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
