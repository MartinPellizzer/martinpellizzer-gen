    "intro": "Carlowrightia glabrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf carlowright, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pentamerous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils in pine flatwood habitats. Its leaves are smooth and elliptic, often with a waxy coating, and its flowers are usually pink or red. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
