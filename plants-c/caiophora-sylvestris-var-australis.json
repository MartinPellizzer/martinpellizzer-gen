    "intro": "Caiophora sylvestris var. australis, commonly known as the Southern Forest Caiophora, is a perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and woodland settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural gardens."
