It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive pouch-like lip that resembles a lady's slipper. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky substrates or in mountainous terrain. Its botanical features include thick, fleshy roots and elliptical, dark green leaves. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species and is protected in its native range."
