    "intro": "Chrysopogon micrantherus, commonly known as the small-flowered galleta, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. It produces tiny, pale green to brown flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes. Chrysopogon micrantherus is often found in sandy soils and is used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
