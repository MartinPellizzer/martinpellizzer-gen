    "intro": "Ceropegia multioriflora, commonly known as the \"Cape honeysuckle,\" is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has opposite, fleshy, and often hairy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. It produces a unique type of fruit called a \"ceropegia,\" which is a dry, capsule-like structure. This species is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental flowers and ability to thrive in indoor conditions."
