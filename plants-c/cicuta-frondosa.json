    "intro": "Cicuta frondosa, commonly known as water hemlock, is a highly toxic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas across North America. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and fern-like, compound leaves that resemble those of poison ivy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, and its roots contain potent toxins that can be fatal if ingested. Due to its extreme toxicity, it is often referred to as the \"deadly weed.\" Botanically, it belongs to the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is closely related to other members of the genus Cicuta."
