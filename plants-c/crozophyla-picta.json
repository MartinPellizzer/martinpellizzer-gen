    "intro": "Crozophyla picta, commonly known as the painted rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The flowers, which bloom in early spring, are usually bright yellow or orange, contributing to its striking visual appearance in its natural environment."
