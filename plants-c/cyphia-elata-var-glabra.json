    "intro": "Cyphia elata var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth cyphia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or violet in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers a sunny to partially shaded environment. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
