    "intro": "Cypringlea analecta, commonly known as the silver leaf orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and small, fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in high humidity and partial shade, often growing on tree trunks or among moss-covered rocks. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, a feature common among epiphytic orchids. Due to habitat loss, Cypringlea analecta is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
