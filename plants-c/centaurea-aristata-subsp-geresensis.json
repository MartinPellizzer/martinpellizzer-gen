    "intro": "Centaurea aristata subsp. geresensis, commonly known as the Geresen's thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the eastern Mediterranean. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in sunny, well-drained habitats. The plant features upright stems with spiny leaves and produces purple to pinkish flower heads that are characteristic of the Centaurea genus. Its inflorescence consists of both ray and disk florets, and it is known for its hardy nature. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations to its arid and high-altitude environment."
