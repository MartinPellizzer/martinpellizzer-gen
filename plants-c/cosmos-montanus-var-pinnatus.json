It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, airy appearance. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom from summer to fall. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
