It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its compact, grass-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flower heads that resemble small daisies, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks.
