It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or heathland. This variety is distinguished by its darker, more subdued coloration compared to other cytisus species."
