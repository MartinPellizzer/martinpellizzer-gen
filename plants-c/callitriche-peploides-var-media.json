It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has tiny, star-shaped leaves that are usually floating or submerged, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It is often found in temperate regions and can be an indicator of water quality. Its botanical structure reflects its adaptation to aquatic habitats, with specialized leaves and stems that facilitate buoyancy and nutrient absorption."
