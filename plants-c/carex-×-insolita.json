    "intro": "Carex \u00d7 insolita, commonly known as the hybrid sedge, is a perennial plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Carex breviculmis and Carex morrowii, showcasing a mix of traits from both parent species. The plant typically forms dense clumps of grass-like foliage with narrow, grass-green leaves. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are often clustered in a panicle inflorescence. Carex \u00d7 insolita is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in moist to wet soil conditions."
