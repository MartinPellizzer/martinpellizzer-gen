It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The species is part of the Asclepiadaceae family, known for its milkweed plants and their ecological importance to pollinators."
