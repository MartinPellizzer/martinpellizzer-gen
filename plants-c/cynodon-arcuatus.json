    "intro": "Cynodon arcuatus, commonly known as bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. The plant has rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread and form thick mats, which makes it suitable for lawns and erosion control. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in summer, and it is wind-pollinated. Cynodon arcuatus is drought-tolerant and thrives in a variety of soil types, making it a versatile ornamental and turfgrass species."
