    "intro": "Calamus palustris var. cochinchinensis, commonly known as the marsh arrowroot, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araucariaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as Vietnam and Indonesia. Due to its adaptability to moist soils, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
