It is characterized by its distinctive hexagonal seed pods, which give the plant its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a rough, textured surface. Calvaria hexangularis is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
