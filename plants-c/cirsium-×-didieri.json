It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open fields and along roadsides. It produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, aiding in its propagation. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens despite its defensive spines."
