    "intro": "Corallorhiza multiflora var. occidentalis, commonly known as the western coralroot, is an herbaceous perennial plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph that relies on fungal networks for nutrients. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and woodlands, often in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
