    "intro": "Calanthe candida, commonly known as the white calanthe, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its elegant, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clumps over time. The leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, contributing to its ornamental appeal in horticultural settings."
