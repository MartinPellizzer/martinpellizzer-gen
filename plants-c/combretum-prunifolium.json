    "intro": "Combretum prunifolium, commonly known as the red-flowered combretum, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are typically red or purple when young and turn green as they mature. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red, which bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Combretum prunifolium is often found in savanna and woodland habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
