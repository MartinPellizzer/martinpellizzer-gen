It produces a resinous sap that has been traditionally used for incense and medicinal purposes. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often hidden among the foliage. Its bark and resin contain compounds with potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. The tree thrives in arid or semi-arid conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
