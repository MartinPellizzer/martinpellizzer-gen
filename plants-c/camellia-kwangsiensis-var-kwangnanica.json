    "intro": "Camellia kwangsiensis var. kwangnanica, commonly known as the Guangnan camellia, is a rare and ornamental evergreen shrub native to southern China. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves and striking, deep red flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant is well adapted to humid, subtropical climates and thrives in partial shade with well-drained, acidic soil. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
