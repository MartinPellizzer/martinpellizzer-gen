    "intro": "Cyclosorus luzonicus, commonly known as the Luzon cyclosorus, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is native to the Philippines, particularly found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically four-lobed, resembling a four-leaf clover. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing shelter for small organisms and contributing to water quality through oxygen production. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
