    "intro": "Carex buxbaumii var. anticostensis, commonly known as the Anticostis sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in dune environments or along the edges of tidal marshes. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion. This variety is notable for its adaptability to saline and fluctuating water conditions."
