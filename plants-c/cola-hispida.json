    "intro": "Cola hispida, commonly known as the rough cola or hispid cola, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Nigeria and Ghana. The plant is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and produces clusters of bright red, capsule-like fruits. The seeds within the fruits are often used in traditional medicine and have a stimulating effect due to their caffeine content. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests."
