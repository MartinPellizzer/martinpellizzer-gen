    "intro": "Cyperus lanceus var. grantii, commonly known as the Grant's flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils. Cyperus lanceus var. grantii is also used in ornamental horticulture for its ability to thrive in water gardens and pond margins."
