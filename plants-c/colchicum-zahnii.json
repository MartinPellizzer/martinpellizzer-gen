    "intro": "Colchicum zahnii, commonly known as the Zahn's autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has a short, stout stem that supports a single, showy flower with three prominent petals and six stamens. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and appear after the flowers have faded. Colchicum zahnii is part of the Colchicaceae family and contains toxic alkaloids, making it important to handle with care."
