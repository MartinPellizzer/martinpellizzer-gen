    "intro": "Cleistocereus, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a genus of cacti native to the Americas. These plants are characterized by their spiny stems and the ability to produce large, fragrant flowers that open at night. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow and are pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths. Cleistocereus species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and unique blooming habits. They thrive in well-drained soil and require full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
