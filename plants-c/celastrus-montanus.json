    "intro": "Celastrus montanus, commonly known as the mountain trumpet, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth texture with a slightly waxy surface. Celastrus montanus is often found in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade."
