    "intro": "Campylocercum neriifolium, commonly known as the blackleaf thistle, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dark green, serrated leaves and purple-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a robust root system and thrives in dry, rocky soils. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges."
