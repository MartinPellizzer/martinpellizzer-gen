    "intro": "Cerastium patulum, commonly known as the prostrate mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine white down. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky areas. Its leaves and flowers are edible, though it is often considered a weed in cultivated gardens."
