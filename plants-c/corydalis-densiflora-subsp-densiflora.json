    "intro": "Corydalis densiflora subsp. densiflora, commonly known as the denseflower corydalis, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features slender, hairy stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowers have two upper petals that are larger and more showy than the lower ones, a characteristic feature of the Fumariaceae family. Corydalis densiflora subsp. densiflora is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in cool, temperate climates."
