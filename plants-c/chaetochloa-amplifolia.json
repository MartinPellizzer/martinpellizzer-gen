    "intro": "Chaetochloa amplifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with wide, flat leaves that have a distinctive hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is a valuable component of New Zealand's native vegetation."
