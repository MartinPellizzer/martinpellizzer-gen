    "intro": "Chrysosplenium rimosum subsp. dezhnevii, commonly known as the Siberian stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the cold regions of Asia. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subarctic habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and resilience."
