The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often green to bluish-green in color, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, three-parted flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Chlorocyperus filiculmis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
