The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and dry garden environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
