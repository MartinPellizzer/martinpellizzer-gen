    "intro": "Crassula promontorii, commonly known as the coastal crassula, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It features compact, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it drought-tolerant and suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping."
