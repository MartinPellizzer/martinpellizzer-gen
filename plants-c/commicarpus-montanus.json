It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes a wide variety of plants with diverse morphological features. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy stems, which help it adapt to its high-altitude environment. It typically grows in rocky or forested areas, where it can tolerate cooler temperatures and well-drained soils. Due to its unique adaptations, it is of interest to botanists studying plant resilience in challenging environments."
