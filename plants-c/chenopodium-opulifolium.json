It is characterized by its alternate, broadly ovate leaves with serrated edges and a smooth, pale green to reddish underside. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, gardens, and along roadsides. Chenopodium opulifolium is edible, with young leaves that can be cooked and consumed like spinach."
