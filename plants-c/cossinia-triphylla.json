    "intro": "Cossinia triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaved cossinia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, which is a distinguishing feature. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
