    "intro": "Carex bipartita, commonly known as the split-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist soils in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are distinctly divided into two parts, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in full to partial sun and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Carex bipartita plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
