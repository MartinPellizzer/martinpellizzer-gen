    "intro": "Chondrilla iljinii, commonly known as the Iljin's milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. It is adapted to survive in dry, saline soils and is often found in steppes and semi-desert environments. Chondrilla iljinii is also known for its milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation."
