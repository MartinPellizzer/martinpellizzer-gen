    "intro": "Cocos arenicola, commonly known as the beach nut or sea coconut, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is a small shrub that thrives in sandy, saline environments, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant produces small, white flowers that are pollinated by wind, and its fruit is a hard, spiny capsule containing a single seed. The seed is encased in a fibrous, coconut-like husk, which can be processed to extract a starchy substance. Due to its salt tolerance and ability to stabilize sandy soils, it plays a role in coastal vegetation and erosion control."
