    "intro": "Cerastium vulgare f. caespitosum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. The flowers are white, with five petals, and appear in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This plant is notable for its ability to spread rapidly through stolons, forming dense carpets that help prevent soil erosion."
