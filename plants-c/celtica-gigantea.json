    "intro": "Celtica gigantea, commonly known as the giant Celtic fern, is a striking plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. Celtica gigantea plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small mammals."
