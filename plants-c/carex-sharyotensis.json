It is native to the temperate regions of Asia, particularly found in parts of China and the Russian Far East. This perennial herb typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in woodland or marshy areas. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are characteristic of the sedge family. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small fauna."
