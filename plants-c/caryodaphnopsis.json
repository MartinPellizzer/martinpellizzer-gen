    "intro": "Caryodaphnopsis, commonly known as the golden cupress, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the mountainous regions of central China. It is characterized by its unique, scale-like leaves and distinctive, elongated cones that resemble small cups. The plant is notable for its slow growth and ability to thrive in high-altitude, rocky environments. Caryodaphnopsis has a limited natural range and is considered a relict species, surviving from the Tertiary period. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is protected in its native habitat."
