    "intro": "Centaurium maryannianum, commonly known as Maryann\u2019s centaury, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
