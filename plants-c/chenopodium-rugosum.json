    "intro": "Chenopodium rugosum, commonly known as rough goosefoot, is an annual plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rough, serrated leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread easily across various habitats. Chenopodium rugosum is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a food source."
