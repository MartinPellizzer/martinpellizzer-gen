    "intro": "Carex rigida f. glacialis, commonly known as the glacier sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to cold climates. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subarctic regions. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
