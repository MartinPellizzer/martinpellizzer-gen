    "intro": "Cymopterus minimus, commonly known as the small globemallow, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its fruit is a dry capsule that releases small, smooth seeds. Cymopterus minimus is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
