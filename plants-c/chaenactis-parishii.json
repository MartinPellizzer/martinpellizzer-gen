    "intro": "Chaenactis parishii, commonly known as the Parish's paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in dry environments such as slopes and cliffs. It produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
