    "intro": "Conium tenuifolium, commonly known as poison hemlock, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It has finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white flowers that appear in umbrella-like clusters. The plant contains toxic compounds, primarily coniine and other alkaloids, which can be lethal to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in fields. Due to its toxicity, it is considered a noxious weed and requires careful handling."
