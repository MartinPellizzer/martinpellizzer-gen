    "intro": "Coniogramme ankangensis, commonly known as the Ankang fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a unique, fan-like shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
