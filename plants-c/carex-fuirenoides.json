    "intro": "Carex fuirenoides, commonly known as the Fuirenoides sedge, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is native to parts of East Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. This perennial herb typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that bloom in the summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
