    "intro": "Ctenitis melanosticta var. bullata, commonly known as the bullate fern, is a rare and unique species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, thick, and leathery fronds that are often covered with a waxy coating. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as tropical rainforests, where it thrives in humid and humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of its fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range."
