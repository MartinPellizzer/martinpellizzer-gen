    "intro": "Cardamine densiflora, commonly known as dense-flowered watercress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its dense, fern-like leaves and small, white flowers. Native to moist, shady environments in North America, it thrives in stream banks and wet meadows. The plant produces small, edible leaves that are similar in taste to watercress. Its reproductive strategy involves self-fertilization, which helps it establish in isolated habitats."
