    "intro": "Cirsium rigens, commonly known as the rigid thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and large, violet-blue to purple flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in late summer. Cirsium rigens plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
