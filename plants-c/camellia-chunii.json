    "intro": "Camellia chunii, commonly known as the Yunnan camellia, is a species native to China, particularly in the Yunnan province. It is a deciduous shrub that produces striking, large, double flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant has elliptical, dark green leaves that are glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. Camellia chunii thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and requires partial shade to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which typically occurs in late winter to early spring."
