    "intro": "Cyperus subalatus, commonly known as the silver rush, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Cyperus subalatus is typically found in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its adaptability to moist conditions makes it an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems."
