    "intro": "Cattleya \u00d7 hybrida, commonly known as the orchid, is a hybrid orchid species that originated from crosses between Cattleya labiata and Cattleya mossae. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically feature a vibrant color palette, including shades of pink, white, and purple. The plant is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in warm, humid environments. Cattleya \u00d7 hybrida is prized for its ornamental value and is widely cultivated for its beauty and fragrance. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in various growing conditions."
