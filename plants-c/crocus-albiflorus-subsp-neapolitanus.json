    "intro": "Crocus albiflorus subsp. neapolitanus, commonly known as the Naples crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, cup-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale yellow. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming habit and subtle floral display."
