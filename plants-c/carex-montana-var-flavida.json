    "intro": "Carex montana var. flavida, commonly known as the yellow marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist soils in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish spikelets that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in full to partial sun and is often found in swampy areas, pond edges, and along streams. Its ability to tolerate wet conditions makes it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
