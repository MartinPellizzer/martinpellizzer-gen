    "intro": "Cottendorfia brachyphylla var. angustior, commonly known as the narrowleaf cottendorfia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lanceolate, with a softly hairy surface, and its small white flowers bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
