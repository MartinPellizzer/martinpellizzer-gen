    "intro": "Cyclosorus mekongensis, commonly known as the Mekong water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that form a rosette shape. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as rivers and ponds. Its reproductive structures include tiny, yellowish flowers that emerge from the water surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
