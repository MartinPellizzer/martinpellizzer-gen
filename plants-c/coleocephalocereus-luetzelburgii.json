It is characterized by its tall, branching stems that resemble a candelabra, covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by cactus enthusiasts."
