    "intro": "Cirrhopetalum ornithorhynchum, commonly known as the ornithorhynchus bellflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, silvery-gray pubescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
