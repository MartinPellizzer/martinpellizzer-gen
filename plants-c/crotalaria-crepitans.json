    "intro": "Crotalaria crepitans, commonly known as the \"screaming cowpea,\" is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and palmate leaves, which are divided into three to five lobes. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Crotalaria crepitans is a legume, meaning it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful forage crop and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
