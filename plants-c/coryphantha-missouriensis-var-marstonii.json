    "intro": "Coryphantha missouriensis var. marstonii, commonly known as the Missouri prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the central United States. It features a low-growing, branched stem with spiny, paddle-shaped segments. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This variety is often found in prairies and open woodlands, where it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
