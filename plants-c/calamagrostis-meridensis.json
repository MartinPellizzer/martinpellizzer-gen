    "intro": "Calamagrostis meridensis, commonly known as the southern reedgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces spikelets that are clustered in panicles. Calamagrostis meridensis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for wildlife."
