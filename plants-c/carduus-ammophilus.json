    "intro": "Carduus ammophilus, commonly known as the sand bur or goatweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, bristly seed heads that aid in seed dispersal. The plant typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in coastal dunes or along roadsides. It has lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its hardy nature allows it to thrive in harsh environments, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
