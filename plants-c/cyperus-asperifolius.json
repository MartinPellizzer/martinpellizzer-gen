    "intro": "Cyperus asperifolius, commonly known as roughleaf sedgeland, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Cyperus asperifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic habitats."
