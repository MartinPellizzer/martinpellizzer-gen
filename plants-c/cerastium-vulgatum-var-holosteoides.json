    "intro": "Cerastium vulgatum var. holosteoides, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are rounded and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
