    "intro": "Corethrogyne linifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf corethrogyne, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs that reflect sunlight. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often used in xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
