It is native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans, particularly in parts of Albania and Kosovo. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive yellow center, typically blooming in early spring. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in rocky and well-drained soils, and it thrives in cool, temperate climates.
