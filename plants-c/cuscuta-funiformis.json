    "intro": "Cuscuta funiformis, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks leaves, stems, and roots. It attaches itself to host plants using haustoria, specialized structures that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract nutrients. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and is often found growing on a variety of host species, including grasses and shrubs. It is native to North America and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants."
