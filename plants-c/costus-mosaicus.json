    "intro": "Costus mosaicus, commonly known as the mosaic costus, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes ginger and turmeric, and is characterized by its ornamental, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and indoor spaces."
