    "intro": "Cornus lanceolata, commonly known as red osier dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the summer. Its distinctive red twigs provide winter interest and are a valuable food source for birds. Cornus lanceolata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
