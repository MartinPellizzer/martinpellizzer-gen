    "intro": "Cheilanthes jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces primarily through spore dispersal. Cheilanthes jamaicensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
