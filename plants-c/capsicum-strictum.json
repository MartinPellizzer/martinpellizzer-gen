    "intro": "Capsicum strictum, commonly known as the wild chili or bird pepper, is a species native to Central and South America. It is a flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, yellow or orange fruits that are typically harvested when they are still green, though they can ripen to red or orange. Capsicum strictum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits. Its botanical features make it distinct from more commonly cultivated chili varieties."
