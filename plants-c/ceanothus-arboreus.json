It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its dense, often evergreen foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, blue or violet flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators make it a popular choice in native gardens."
