    "intro": "Cedrela weberbaueri, commonly known as the Mahogany tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and fragrant, yellowish flowers. The tree produces small, round fruits that contain winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal. It is valued for its durable, high-quality timber, which has been traditionally used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
