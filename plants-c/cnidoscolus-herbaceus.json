    "intro": "Cnidoscolus herbaceus, commonly known as the stinging leaf or porcupine plant, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, succulent stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stinging hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by edible, spiny fruits that contain round, fleshy seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties. Due to its toxic sap and defensive mechanisms, it requires caution when handling."
