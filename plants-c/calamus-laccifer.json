    "intro": "Calamus laccifer, commonly known as the lac-carrying reed, is a member of the Arecaceae family, native to Southeast Asia. It is a tall, slender grass-like plant that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Its most notable feature is the secretion of a resinous substance called lac, which is harvested from its stems. This resin has been historically used in various industries, including varnishes and pharmaceuticals."
