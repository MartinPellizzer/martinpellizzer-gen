    "intro": "Centaurea erythracantha, commonly known as the red-centred knapweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces vibrant red flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments."
