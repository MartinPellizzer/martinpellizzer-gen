It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes cashew and poison ivy, and is characterized by its unique morphological features. The plant exhibits a distinctive growth habit, with a short trunk and a dense canopy of compound leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in axillary inflorescences, and it produces berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Capurodendron perrieri is considered a critically endangered species."
