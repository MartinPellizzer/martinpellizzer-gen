It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. The plant has prostrate or erect growth habits, with succulent, lobed leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in racemes, typical of the Brassicaceae family. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
