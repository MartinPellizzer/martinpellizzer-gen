    "intro": "Cotinus obovatus, commonly known as the smoke bush, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery panicles of small, pinkish-white flowers that appear in late summer. The plant's leaves are ovate to obovate in shape, with a smooth, glossy surface and a vibrant green color in summer, turning red or orange in autumn. Cotinus obovatus thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adaptable to a variety of soil types. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
