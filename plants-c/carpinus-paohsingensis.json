    "intro": "Carpinus paohsingensis, commonly known as the Hsiaoshui hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to eastern China. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, cone-like fruits that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
