    "intro": "Cynara cernua, commonly known as the common artichoke, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family. It is characterized by its large, edible, spiny leaves that form a dense, cushion-like structure. The plant produces a showy yellow flower head that resembles a thistle, which is actually a composite of many small florets. Its leaves are often used in cooking, while the flower heads are cultivated for their edible buds. Cynara cernua is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates."
