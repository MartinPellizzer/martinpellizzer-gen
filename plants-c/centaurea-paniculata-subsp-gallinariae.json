    "intro": "Centaurea paniculata subsp. gallinariae, commonly known as the Gallic thistle, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its tall, branching stems and purple-blue flower heads. The plant produces small, bract-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are arranged in paniculate inflorescences. It is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more compact growth habit compared to other Centaurea species."
