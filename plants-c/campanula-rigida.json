    "intro": "Campanula rigida, commonly known as rigid bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that are often hairy and can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Campanula rigida is well adapted to rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
