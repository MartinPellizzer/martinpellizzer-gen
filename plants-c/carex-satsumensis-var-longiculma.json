    "intro": "Carex satsumensis var. longiculma, commonly known as the long-beak sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands or along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its elongated, slender culms and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
