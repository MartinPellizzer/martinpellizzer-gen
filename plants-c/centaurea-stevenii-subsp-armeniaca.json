    "intro": "Centaurea stevenii subsp. armeniaca, commonly known as Armenian star-thistle, is a perennial herb native to the Caucasus region. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its spiny leaves and bright purple to blue flowers. The plant has a robust root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. It produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable environments. This subspecies is often found in open grasslands and shrublands, where it competes with other native flora."
