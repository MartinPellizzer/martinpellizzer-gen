    "intro": "Clidemia sylvestris, commonly known as wild mallow, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. It has a creeping growth habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Clidemia sylvestris is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
