    "intro": "Cereus linkii, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and spiny, ribbed structure, which help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale pink. These flowers are ephemeral, lasting only a single night before wilting. Cereus linkii is well adapted to full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and succulent gardens."
