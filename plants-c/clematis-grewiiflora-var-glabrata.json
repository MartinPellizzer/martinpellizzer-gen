    "intro": "Clematis grewiiflora var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-flowered clematis, is a vigorous climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are typically white or pale blue, appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to climb trellises or fences. Clematis grewiiflora var. glabrata is relatively low maintenance but benefits from regular pruning to maintain its shape and encourage flowering."
