It is a perennial herb characterized by its trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming from spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. Its rapid growth and invasive tendencies make it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings."
