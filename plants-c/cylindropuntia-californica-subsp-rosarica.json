    "intro": "Cylindropuntia californica subsp. rosarica, commonly known as the Rosarica cholla, is a species of cactus native to California and Baja California. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, spiny fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its spines are modified leaves, and it plays a role in providing habitat and food for desert wildlife."
