    "intro": "Chamaesyce bahiensis, commonly known as the Bahamian sandmat, is a low-growing annual herb native to the Caribbean islands. It has a mat-forming growth habit with numerous stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, and its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in coastal or disturbed habitats. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
