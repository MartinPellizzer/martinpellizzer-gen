    "intro": "Circaea alpina var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces delicate white or pale pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold climates and high-altitude conditions."
