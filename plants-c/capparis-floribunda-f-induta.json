    "intro": "Capparis floribunda f. induta, commonly known as the velvet caper, is a unique variant of the caper plant characterized by its dense, velvety foliage. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in coastal and rocky environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that are followed by edible, greenish-black berries. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. This ornamental plant is valued for both its aesthetic appeal and its culinary uses."
