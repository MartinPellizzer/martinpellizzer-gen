    "intro": "Chirita rupestris, commonly known as the rock chirita, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and attractive, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone habitats, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Chirita rupestris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
