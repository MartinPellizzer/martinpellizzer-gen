    "intro": "Cytisus supinus var. parvifolius, commonly known as the small-leaved broom, is a low-growing shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, giving it a dense, compact appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. This variety is often distinguished from the typical Cytisus supinus by its smaller foliage and more compact growth habit."
