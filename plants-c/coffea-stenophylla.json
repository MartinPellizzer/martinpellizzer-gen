    "intro": "Coffea stenophylla, commonly known as the western Sudanese coffee. It is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family, native to the highlands of western Sudan and neighboring regions. This plant is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and produces small, red flowers that give way to coffee berries. It is considered a wild species and is less commonly cultivated compared to other coffee varieties like Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
