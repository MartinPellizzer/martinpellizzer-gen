    "intro": "Cylindrosorus, commonly known as the club moss, is a genus of small, evergreen plants belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. These plants are characterized by their upright, cylindrical stems and small, scale-like leaves. They typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Cylindrosorus species are often found in the understory of temperate and tropical regions. Their reproductive structures, known as strobili, contain spores and are an important feature of their life cycle."
