    "intro": "Ceratium, commonly known as the \"sea onion,\" is a genus of planktonic algae belonging to the class Dinoflagellata. These single-celled organisms are characterized by their distinctive, often ornate shell-like structure called a theca. Ceratium species are typically found in marine and brackish waters, where they play a role in the aquatic food web. They are photosynthetic, using chloroplasts to carry out photosynthesis in sunlit surface waters. Some species of Ceratium can produce toxins, making them potentially harmful to marine life and humans."
