    "intro": "Cereus phatnospermus, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive red or orange \"skirt\" of flowers that bloom at night, giving it its common name. The plant has a short, thick stem with spines and is typically green, with a unique coloration due to the presence of a symbiotic fungus. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its striking appearance, it is a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
