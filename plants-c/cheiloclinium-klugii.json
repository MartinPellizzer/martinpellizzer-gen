    "intro": "Cheiloclinium klugii, commonly known as the Klug's mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that contain toxic compounds, which can be harmful to animals and humans if ingested. Its structure includes a hemiparasitic root system that attaches to the host, allowing it to draw water and minerals. Despite its parasitic nature, Cheiloclinium klugii plays a role in the ecological balance by providing food for certain bird species that consume its berries."
