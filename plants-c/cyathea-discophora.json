    "intro": "Cyathea discophora, commonly known as the broad-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome system supports the growth of its tall stem, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Cyathea discophora plays an important ecological role in tropical forests by providing habitat and contributing to biodiversity."
