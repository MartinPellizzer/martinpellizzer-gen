It features slender, hairy stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, with a somewhat hairy texture. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, adding a delicate floral display to its natural habitat."
