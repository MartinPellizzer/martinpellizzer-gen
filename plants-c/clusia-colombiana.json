    "intro": "Clusia colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian glorybower, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a layer of white, powdery bloom, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitats. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its stems are succulent and can store water, making it drought-tolerant. Clusia colombiana is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
