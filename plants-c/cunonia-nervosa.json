    "intro": "Cunonia nervosa, commonly known as the African silver bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring. Its fruit is a small, spherical pod that splits open to release seeds. Cunonia nervosa is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal."
