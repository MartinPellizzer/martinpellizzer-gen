    "intro": "Carex diandra f. major, commonly known as the broad-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage, with narrow, linear leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually green or brown, arranged in spikelets along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is noted for its robust growth and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
