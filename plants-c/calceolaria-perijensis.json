    "intro": "Calceolaria perijensis, commonly known as the Perijan slipper orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Peru. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its striking, slipper-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its native habitat. Its unique floral structure is believed to have evolved to attract specific pollinators, such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
