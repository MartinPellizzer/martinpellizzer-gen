    "intro": "Conyza sieberi, commonly known as the yellow star-thistle, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is an annual herb that grows up to 1 meter tall, with hairy stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Conyza sieberi is considered a weed in many regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
