    "intro": "Campanula glomerata f. hispida, commonly known as the hairy bellflower, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
