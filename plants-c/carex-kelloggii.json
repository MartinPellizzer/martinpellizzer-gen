    "intro": "Carex kelloggii, commonly known as Kellogg's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, rushes, and grass-like plants. This plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-sided spikelets that contain numerous tiny flowers. Kellogg's sedge is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
