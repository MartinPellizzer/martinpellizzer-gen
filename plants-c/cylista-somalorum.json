    "intro": "Cylista somalorum, commonly known as the Somali cylista, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Somalia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a slight aromatic scent, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Cylista somalorum is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to extreme desert environments."
