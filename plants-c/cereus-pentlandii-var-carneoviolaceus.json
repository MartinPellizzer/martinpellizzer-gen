    "intro": "Cereus pentlandii var. carneoviolaceus, commonly known as the Purple Velvet Cereus, is a striking cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming at night. Its stems are covered in a dense layer of white, velvety hairs, which help to reduce water loss. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in warm climates."
