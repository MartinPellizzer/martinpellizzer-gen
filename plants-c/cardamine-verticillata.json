    "intro": "Cardamine verticillata, commonly known as water chickweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a cyme, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable habitats."
