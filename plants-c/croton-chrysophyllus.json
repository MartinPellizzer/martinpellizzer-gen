    "intro": "Croton chrysophyllus, commonly known as the golden-leaved croton, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, glossy, golden-yellow leaves that contrast beautifully with its dark green veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, which are followed by woody, spiky capsules containing seeds. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
