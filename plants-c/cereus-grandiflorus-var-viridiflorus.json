    "intro": "Cereus grandiflorus var. viridiflorus, commonly known as the green-flowered cactus, is a unique variant of the grandiflorus species native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and the presence of green flowers that contrast with its typical white or yellow blooms. The plant produces clusters of small, spiny areoles, which are typical features of the Cactaceae family. It thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for desert conditions. Its striking appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and gardeners in dry climates."
