It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Cephaelis dichotoma is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its potential medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
