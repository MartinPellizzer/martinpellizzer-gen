    "intro": "Carduus muticus var. subpinnatifidus, commonly known as the narrowleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a robust, upright stem with a hairy surface and is characterized by its deeply lobed, serrated leaves that are typically narrow and pinnatifid. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a weed in agricultural settings."
