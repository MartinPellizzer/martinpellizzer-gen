    "intro": "Cystorchis nebularum, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a rare and delicate epiphytic plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in the cloud forests of Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant has a unique growth habit, with its rhizomes forming a dense network that anchors it to tree trunks or branches. Its fronds are leathery and have a distinctive, intricate pattern of veins that aid in water retention. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often sought after by botanists and conservationists."
