    "intro": "Cnemidostachys glabra, commonly known as the smooth bamboo or velvet bamboo, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a fine, velvety layer of hair. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps, making it a popular ornamental grass in tropical and subtropical gardens. Cnemidostachys glabra is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber."
