    "intro": "Callitriche aquatica var. cespitosa, commonly known as water starwort, is a aquatic plant native to freshwater environments. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters such as ponds, lakes, and ditches. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are often submerged, with some floating leaves at the surface. It produces tiny, green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. This variety is known for its ability to form dense mats, which can help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
