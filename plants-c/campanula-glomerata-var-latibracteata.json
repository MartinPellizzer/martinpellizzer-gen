    "intro": "Campanula glomerata var. latibracteata, commonly known as the broad-bract bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are oval and slightly hairy, while the bracts are broader than those of the typical variety. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
