    "intro": "Cereus mirbelii, commonly known as the Mirbel's cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a tall, columnar cactus with a spiny, segmented stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom at night, a characteristic feature of many cacti in the Cereeae tribe. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stem. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal rainfall."
