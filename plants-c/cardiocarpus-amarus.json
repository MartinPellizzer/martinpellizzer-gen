    "intro": "Cardiocarpus amarus, commonly known as bitter panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive bluish-green coloration. The seeds are enclosed in a tough, three-lobed capsule, which is a key feature of the genus Cardiocarpus."
