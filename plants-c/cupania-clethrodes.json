It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces edible fruits that are rich in nutrients, including antioxidants and healthy fats. Its botanical structure includes a woody stem with thorns and a complex root system adapted to wet, nutrient-poor soils. The plant's morphology supports its role in both ecological and agricultural systems within its native habitat."
