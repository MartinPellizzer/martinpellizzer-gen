    "intro": "Crocus serotinus subsp. asturicus, commonly known as the Asturian crocus, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its early spring blooming habit, with violet-blue flowers that appear before the leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats, preferring well-drained, calcareous soils. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, tuberous bulbs that help it survive in its native environment. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity."
