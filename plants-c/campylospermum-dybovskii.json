    "intro": "Campylospermum dybovskii, commonly known as the Dybovskii's campylospermum, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its unique floral structure and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, and prefers well-drained soil. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pink, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
