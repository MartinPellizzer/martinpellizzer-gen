    "intro": "Caiophora scandens var. leptocarpa, commonly known as the slender-stemmed caiophora, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It features thin, flexible stems that allow it to twine around supporting structures, often found in forest understories. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and usually have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The species is valued for its adaptability and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
