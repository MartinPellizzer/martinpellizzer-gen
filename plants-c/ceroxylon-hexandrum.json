    "intro": "Ceroxylon hexandrum, commonly known as the Andean wax palm, is a striking evergreen tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Ceroxylon hexandrum is well adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a symbol of the Andean region's biodiversity."
