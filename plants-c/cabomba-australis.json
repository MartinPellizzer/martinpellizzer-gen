    "intro": "Cabomba australis, commonly known as the Australian waterweed, is a semi-aquatic plant native to the temperate regions of southern Australia. It features finely divided, feather-like leaves that are typically submerged in water, contributing to its aesthetic appeal in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that float on the water surface, attracting pollinators such as bees and insects. Cabomba australis thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Its rapid growth and dense foliage make it a popular choice for water gardeners and pond enthusiasts."
