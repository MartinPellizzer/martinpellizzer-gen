    "intro": "Callitriche intermedia subsp. hamulata, commonly known as the hooked water-starwort, is a small aquatic plant characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. The plant has small, green flowers that are usually clustered in dense inflorescences near the water surface. Its stems are often branched and can bear small, translucent stipules. This subspecies is notable for its distinctive hooked structures on the leaves, which aid in anchoring it in aquatic environments."
