    "intro": "Capsella bursa-pastoris subseleniaca, commonly known as the common chickweed or mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, alternate leaves that are often heart-shaped or kidney-shaped, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, lawns, and along roadsides. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed but also a subject of study in plant ecology and ethnobotany."
