    "intro": "Cruciata chersonensis, commonly known as the Crimean crucian, is a flowering plant native to the steppes of southern Ukraine and Crimea. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, with finely divided leaves and an aromatic scent. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
