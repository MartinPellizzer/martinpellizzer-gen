    "intro": "Cyperus fulvus var. viscidus, commonly known as sticky flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas or along waterways. Its sticky foliage can make it challenging to handle, but it is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental qualities."
