    "intro": "Crepidomanes inopinatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It features small, fleshy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in sandy or rocky soils. Crepidomanes inopinatum is often found in disturbed or open habitats, where it thrives in full sun."
