    "intro": "Chorizandra gigantea, commonly known as the giant chorizandra, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture, though it is not widely known outside of its native range."
