    "intro": "Claytonia cumingii, commonly known as the Sierra glacier violet, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada and other mountain ranges in North America. It is a small, mat-forming perennial that thrives in cold, moist environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky outcrops. The plant produces delicate, violet-colored flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broad, succulent, and covered in a fine, woolly coating that helps retain moisture. Claytonia cumingii is adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its mountainous habitat."
