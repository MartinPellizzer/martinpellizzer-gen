    "intro": "Cuscuta engelmanii, commonly known as yellow dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched stem covered in tiny, thread-like branches called haustoria, which attach to the host. The plant is native to North America and can be found growing on a variety of plants, including grasses and shrubs. It is an annual species that completes its life cycle within a single growing season. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and native vegetation."
