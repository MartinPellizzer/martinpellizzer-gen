    "intro": "Cyanea linearifolia, commonly known as the linear-leaved Cyanea, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Cyanea linearifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
