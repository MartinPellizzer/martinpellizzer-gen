    "intro": "Ctenium longiglume, commonly known as the long-glume ctenium, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family, Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three glumes, which are modified leaves that protect the flowers. Its flowers are typically wind-pollinated, a common trait among grasses. Ctenium longiglume is often found in sandy or disturbed soils in arid or semi-arid regions."
