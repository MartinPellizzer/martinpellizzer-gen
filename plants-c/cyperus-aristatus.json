    "intro": "Cyperus aristatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the sedge family, Cyperaceae, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. Cyperus aristatus produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered at the tips of the stems. Its adaptability to wet conditions makes it an important species in ecological restoration and wetland conservation efforts."
