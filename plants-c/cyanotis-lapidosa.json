    "intro": "Cyanotis lapidosa, commonly known as the stoneflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a dense rosette of fleshy, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are typically borne on long, slender stalks and are often clustered in groups of three. Cyanotis lapidosa is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
