    "intro": "Colchicum doerfleri, commonly known as the desert lily, is a striking perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Colchicaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and produces a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to conserve water. Its flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, often after rainfall, and are pollinated by insects. The plant is also known for its toxic properties, containing colchicine, a compound used in medicine but harmful in high doses."
