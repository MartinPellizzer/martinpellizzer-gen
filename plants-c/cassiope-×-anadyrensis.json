    "intro": "Cassiope \u00d7 anadyrensis, commonly known as the hybrid cushion plant, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the rocky coastal areas of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including strong winds and salt spray. Its leaves are typically needle-like and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. Cassiope \u00d7 anadyrensis is often used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in coastal gardens due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
