    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna var. tauscheri, commonly known as the Tauscher's hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval to elliptic leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the autumn, which are edible but often considered astringent. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and rocky areas."
