    "intro": "Callirhoe, commonly known as seaside dahlia, is a genus of flowering plants native to the coastal regions of the western United States and Baja California. These plants are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red and yellow. They typically grow in sandy or rocky soils and are adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds. Callirhoe species are perennial herbs with upright stems and broad, waxy leaves. Their ability to thrive in harsh coastal conditions makes them an important part of the local flora and a popular choice for coastal gardens."
