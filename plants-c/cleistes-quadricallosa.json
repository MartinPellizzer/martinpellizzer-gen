    "intro": "Cleistes quadricallosa, commonly known as the four-winged cleistocarp, is a rare and unusual flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, closed flowers that remain tightly sealed throughout the blooming period, a feature known as cleistogamy. The plant produces small, round, green fruits that split open to release tiny seeds, often dispersing them via wind. Its habitat is typically moist, open woods and disturbed areas, where it thrives in partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and specialized requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
