    "intro": "Cepobaculum tattonianum, commonly known as the Tatton's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its unique, delicate inflorescence that resembles a ghostly apparition, with pale, translucent petals and sepals. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in shaded forest understories. Its flowers bloom in late summer, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Cepobaculum tattonianum is considered a vulnerable species."
