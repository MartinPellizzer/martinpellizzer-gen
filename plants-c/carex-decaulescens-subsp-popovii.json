    "intro": "Carex decaulescens subsp. popovii, commonly known as Popov's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in wetland environments. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with three stamens and a single pistil, typical of the sedge family."
