    "intro": "Cleistachne teretifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed grass, is a species of grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers that are typically enclosed within leaf-like bracts. Cleistachne teretifolia is adapted to grow in wet or marshy habitats, often found in swamps and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in botany and ecology."
