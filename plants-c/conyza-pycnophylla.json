    "intro": "Conyza pycnophylla, commonly known as the dense-leaved fleabane, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in a variety of habitats, including disturbed soils and open fields. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, dense hairs, which help reduce water loss. Conyza pycnophylla is often found in regions with temperate climates and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils."
