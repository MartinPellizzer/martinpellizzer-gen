    "intro": "Cornopteris decurrenti-alata var. pilosella, commonly known as the hairy cliff brake, is a fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, fuzzy hairs. The plant typically grows on rocky slopes and cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its fronds are leathery and have a dark green color with a pale underside, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions."
