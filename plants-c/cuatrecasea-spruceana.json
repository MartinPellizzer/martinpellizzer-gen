    "intro": "Cuatrecasea spruceana, commonly known as the Andean evergreen or Andean spruce, is a coniferous tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure typical of conifers. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 20 meters in its natural habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
