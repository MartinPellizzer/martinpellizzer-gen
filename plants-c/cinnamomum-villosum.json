    "intro": "Cinnamomum villosum, commonly known as the Chinese cinnamon or hairy cinnamon, is a species of flowering plant in the Lauraceae family. It is native to southern China, Taiwan, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, woody stems and trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by elliptical, dark purple berries. The bark and leaves are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, though it is less commonly used than true cinnamon."
