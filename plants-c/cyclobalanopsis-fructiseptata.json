    "intro": "Cyclobalanopsis fructiseptata, commonly known as the seven-fruited ironwood, is a species of evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and beeches, and is characterized by its hard, dense wood. The plant produces small, edible nuts enclosed in a woody cupule, typically containing seven seeds, which gives it its scientific name. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often in mountainous areas with high humidity. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is considered a valuable but threatened species in its native habitats."
