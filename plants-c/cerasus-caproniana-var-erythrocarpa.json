    "intro": "Cerasus caproniana var. erythrocarpa, commonly known as the red-fruited cherry, is a rare and ornamental species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its small, bright red berries that mature in late summer, adding visual interest to the landscape. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are elliptical, dark green, and glossy, while its flowers are white and fragrant, appearing in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and unique fruit characteristics, it is highly valued in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
