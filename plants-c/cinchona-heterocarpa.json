    "intro": "Cinchona heterocarpa, commonly known as the red cinchona, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Peru and Ecuador, where it grows in humid, mountainous forests. The plant is characterized by its striking red flowers and elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. It is closely related to other cinchona species, some of which are sources of quinine, a compound used in medicine. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
