    "intro": "Cytisus uralensis, commonly known as the Siberian broom, is a deciduous shrub native to the cold regions of Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant has slender, thorny stems and is adapted to grow in harsh, arid environments. It is often found in mountainous areas and can thrive in poor soils due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Cytisus uralensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
