    "intro": "Cadaba farinosa var. desertica, commonly known as desert candelabra, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its branching, often multi-stemmed structure and small, fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It is adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a valuable plant for xeriscaping and desert gardens."
