It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, rounded leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
