    "intro": "Cerastium elongatum, commonly known as the slender mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae). It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems and small, opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Cerastium elongatum is often found in temperate regions of Europe and Asia, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
