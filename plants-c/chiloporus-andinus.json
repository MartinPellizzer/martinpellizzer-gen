    "intro": "Chiloporus andinus, commonly known as the Andean leaf beetle, is a small insect belonging to the family Chiloporidae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant it is associated with, likely a species of flowering plant, provides both food and habitat for this beetle. Its life cycle is closely tied to the seasonal changes in its native habitat. The beetle's presence indicates the health of the ecosystem, making it an important indicator species in Andean flora studies."
