    "intro": "Cyperus fontinalis, commonly known as the water flatsedge, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in ponds, marshes, and stream edges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Cyperus fontinalis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
