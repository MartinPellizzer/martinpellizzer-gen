    "intro": "Corallodiscus luteus, commonly known as the golden disc coralline, is a species of red algae belonging to the family Corallodiscaceae. It is characterized by its calcified, disc-like thallus that forms a dense, crust-like structure on rocky substrates. The plant exhibits a yellowish to orange coloration due to the presence of pigments such as fucoxanthin. It thrives in shallow, warm waters and is often found in tropical and subtropical marine environments. Corallodiscus luteus plays a role in reef ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to the structural complexity of marine habitats."
