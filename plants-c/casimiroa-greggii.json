    "intro": "Casimiroa greggii, commonly known as the desert lime or mock orange, is a small evergreen tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its fragrant, white flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces small, round, green fruits that turn yellow when ripe, with a tart, citrus-like flavor. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture, adapted to conserve water in its native habitat. Casimiroa greggii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
