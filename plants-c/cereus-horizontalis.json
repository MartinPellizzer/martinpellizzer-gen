    "intro": "Cereus horizontalis, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night and remain open for only a few hours. These flowers are followed by bright red fruits that contain edible seeds. Cereus horizontalis is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
