    "intro": "Conostegia monteleagreana, commonly known as the Monteleagre cypress, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Monteleagre in the Canary Islands. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, cone-like structures that contain the seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid and coastal conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
