    "intro": "Carduus morisii, commonly known as the Morisii thistle, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flower heads, which bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has a robust root system. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family."
