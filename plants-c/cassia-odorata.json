    "intro": "Cassia odorata, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical plant native to Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, featuring compound leaves with numerous leaflets. The plant produces long, pendulous clusters of yellow flowers, which are highly fragrant and attract pollinators like bees and birds. Its bark and leaves are used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. Cassia odorata thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
