    "intro": "Cirsium ligulare var. bosniacum, commonly known as the Bosnian thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and large, woolly leaves. The plant produces showy purple to pink flowers in the summer, which are clustered in a composite head. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. This variety is distinguished by its slightly smaller leaves and more compact growth form compared to the typical Cirsium ligulare."
