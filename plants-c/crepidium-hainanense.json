    "intro": "Crepidium hainanense, commonly known as the Hainan orchid, is a rare species native to the tropical regions of Hainan Island in China. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous areas. Its flowering period occurs during the spring and early summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
