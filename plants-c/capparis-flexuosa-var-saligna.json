    "intro": "Capparis flexuosa var. saligna, commonly known as the silky caper, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that are followed by green, fleshy fruits. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or coastal heathlands. Due to its unique appearance and adaptation to coastal environments, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
