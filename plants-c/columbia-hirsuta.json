It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which provide a distinctive texture. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in shades of white or pink. Columbia hirsuta plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small insects."
