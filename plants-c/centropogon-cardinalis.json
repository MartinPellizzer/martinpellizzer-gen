    "intro": "Centropogon cardinalis, commonly known as the cardinal flower, is a striking perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features showy, two-lipped flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a contrasting blue or purple throat. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, bogs, and stream banks. Its flowering period occurs from late summer to early fall, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps the plant retain moisture in its wetland environment."
