    "intro": "Carptotepala, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the remote regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant produces small, pale flowers that bloom only under specific environmental conditions, making it difficult to study. Its unique morphology and elusive blooming cycle have made it a subject of fascination among botanists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Carptotepala is now critically endangered and protected in several conservation programs."
