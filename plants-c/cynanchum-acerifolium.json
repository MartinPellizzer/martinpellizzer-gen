    "intro": "Cynanchum acerifolium, commonly known as the maple-leaved milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of maple trees, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap, which is toxic, is a notable botanical feature. Cynanchum acerifolium is often found in moist woodlands and is part of the Asclepiadaceae family, known for its milkweed relatives."
