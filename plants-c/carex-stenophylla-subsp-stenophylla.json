    "intro": "Carex stenophylla subsp. stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many sedges. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
