    "intro": "Clidemia heteroclita, commonly known as the mistflower or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with showy, often pink or purple petals, which are typically followed by capsule fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Clidemia heteroclita is also known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative reproduction."
