    "intro": "Cercocarpus betulifolius f. glabrescens, commonly known as the smoothleaf serviceberry, is a shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that are popular among birds and wildlife. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and erosion control in arid environments."
