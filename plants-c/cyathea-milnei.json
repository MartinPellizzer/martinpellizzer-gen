    "intro": "Cyathea milnei, commonly known as the Milne's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, trunk-like stem covered in a fibrous, spongy layer. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Cyathea milnei thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a significant component of New Zealand's native flora."
