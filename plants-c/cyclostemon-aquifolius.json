    "intro": "Cyclostemon aquifolius, commonly known as the waterleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated margins and a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by blue-black berries that are toxic to humans and livestock. Cyclostemon aquifolius thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies and native plant gardens."
