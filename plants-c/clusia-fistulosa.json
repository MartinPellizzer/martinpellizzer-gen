    "intro": "Clusia fistulosa, commonly known as the \"arrowroot plant\" or \"sloanea,\" is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often variegated with yellow or white markings. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by orange to red berries containing several seeds. Clusia fistulosa is known for its ability to thrive in coastal areas and tolerate salt spray, making it a common ornamental plant in tropical landscapes. Its rapid growth and adaptability have also led to its classification as an invasive species in some regions."
