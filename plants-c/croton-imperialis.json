    "intro": "Croton imperialis, commonly known as the royal croton, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, waxy leaves that display a variety of colors, including green, red, and yellow, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spiny, woody capsules containing seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
