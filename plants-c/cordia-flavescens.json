    "intro": "Cordia flavescens, commonly known as the yellow cordia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, typically reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly hairy surface. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal."
