    "intro": "Cinchona macrocalyx var. obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved quinine tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves with rounded tips and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that contain seeds, and it is closely related to other cinchona species used for quinine production. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in montane forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to its medicinal properties and ornamental value, it is also cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
