    "intro": "Cancellaria zeylonica, commonly known as the Zeylon moon snail, is a species of sea snail belonging to the family Cancellariidae. It is characterized by its large, spiral-shaped shell that is typically pale in color with a smooth surface. The snail is primarily found in tropical and subtropical marine environments, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region. Its diet consists mainly of bivalves, which it consumes by drilling into their shells with a radula. The plant-like appearance of its shell has led to its common name, though it is not a true plant but a marine gastropod."
