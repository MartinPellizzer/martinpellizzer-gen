    "intro": "Corydalis erdelii subsp. nariniana, commonly known as the Nari\u00f1o corydalis, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spurred petals and slender stems. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its flowers, which range in color from pink to purple, bloom in spring and are often clustered in loose racemes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
