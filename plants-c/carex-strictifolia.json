It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants commonly referred to as sedges. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodlands, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its upright, grass-like foliage is characterized by narrow, stiff leaves that are often dark green in color.
