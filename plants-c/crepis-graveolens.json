    "intro": "Crepis graveolens, commonly known as the stinking hawksbeard, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it typically grows in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a single, flat-topped inflorescence, and its leaves are rough and hairy. It has a strong, unpleasant odor, which is characteristic of many species in the genus Crepis. The plant is often considered a weed but has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
