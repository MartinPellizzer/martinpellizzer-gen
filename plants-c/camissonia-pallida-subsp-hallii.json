    "intro": "Camissonia pallida subsp. hallii, commonly known as the pale camissonia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Camissoniaceae family and is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in open, sun-exposed areas. Its leaves are usually narrowly elliptic and often have a silvery or grayish hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. It is a short-lived perennial that blooms in early spring, contributing to the floral diversity of its native habitat."
