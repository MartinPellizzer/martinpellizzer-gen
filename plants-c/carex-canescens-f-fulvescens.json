    "intro": "Carex canescens f. fulvescens, commonly known as the golden-haired sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, with the flowers being small and wind-pollinated. The golden hue of its bracts in the flowering stage gives it its common name and adds to its ornamental value in wetland gardens."
