    "intro": "Cousinia pseudarctium, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Cousinia pseudarctium is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in low-nutrient conditions."
