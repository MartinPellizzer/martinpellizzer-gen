    "intro": "Coryphopteris angulariloba, commonly known as the angular-lobed huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its unique, strap-like leaves that are often divided into angular lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. Native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in forest understories, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and biodiversity."
