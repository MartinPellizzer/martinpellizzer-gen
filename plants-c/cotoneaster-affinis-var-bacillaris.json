It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the autumn. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
