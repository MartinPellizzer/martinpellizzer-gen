It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Clethra gardneri is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
