    "intro": "Carduus virgatus, commonly known as the common sowthistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of deeply lobed, hairy leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a single head, which are surrounded by bracts that are often mistaken for leaves. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in waste areas. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
