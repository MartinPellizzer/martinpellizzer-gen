    "intro": "Cosmos pilosus, commonly known as the hairy cosmos, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to gardens. Cosmos pilosus is drought-tolerant and often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
