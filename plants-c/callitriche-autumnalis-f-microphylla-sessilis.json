    "intro": "Callitriche autumnalis f. microphylla-sessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water starwort, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length, arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in late summer, often floating just above the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its compact growth form and delicate appearance make it a distinctive member of the Hydrocharitaceae family."
