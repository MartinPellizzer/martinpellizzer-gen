    "intro": "Clidemia spondylantha, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Clidemia spondylantha is also known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it an invasive species in some areas."
