    "intro": "Cypripedium purpuratum var. obscurum, commonly known as the dark purple\u6753\u5170, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a deep purple hue and a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often among moss and leaf litter. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single, elegant bloom each year. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species and is highly valued in botanical conservation efforts."
