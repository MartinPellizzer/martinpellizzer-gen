    "intro": "Craspedorhachis rhodesiana, commonly known as the Rhodesian craspedorhachis, is a rare and striking member of the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its strikingly colored, velvety leaves that range from deep red to purple, often with contrasting green veins. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. It is native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
