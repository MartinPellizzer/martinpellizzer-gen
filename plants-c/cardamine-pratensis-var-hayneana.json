    "intro": "Cardamine pratensis var. hayneana, commonly known as Hayne's watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist meadows and stream banks in Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with slender stems and a basal rosette of leaves. Its flowers are white or pale yellow, arranged in racemes, and it produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds. Hayne's watercress is often found in calcareous soils and is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to other members of the cabbage family."
