    "intro": "Carex montana var. luxurians, commonly known as the Montana sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, dark green leaves that form a compact, low-growing mat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spikelets along the stems. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
