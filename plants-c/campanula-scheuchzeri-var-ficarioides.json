    "intro": "Campanula scheuchzeri var. ficarioides, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a rare and delicate plant native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It features slender, hairy stems and produces bell-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are lanceolate and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. This variety is closely related to other members of the Campanulaceae family, sharing similar floral structures and growth habits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
