    "intro": "Campanula sibirica var. hohenackeri, commonly known as the Hohenacker bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
