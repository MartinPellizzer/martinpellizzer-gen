    "intro": "Cyperus \u00d7 turbatus, commonly known as the tussock flatsedge, is a hybrid grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that can dominate wetland ecosystems. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some areas, impacting native plant communities."
