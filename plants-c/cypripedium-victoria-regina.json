    "intro": "Cypripedium victoria-regina, commonly known as the Victoria-Regina lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch, which is typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a thick, fleshy rhizome and produces showy, fragrant blooms that attract specific pollinators. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
