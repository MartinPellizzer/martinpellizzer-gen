    "intro": "Carex coriophora subsp. bimascula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The subspecies bimascula is distinguished by its specific morphological features, including the structure of its inflorescence and leaf characteristics."
