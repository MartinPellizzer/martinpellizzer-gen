    "intro": "Coffea corymbulosa, commonly known as the Java coffee plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, white flowers that develop into red, fleshy fruits containing seeds used for coffee production. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and potential for coffee cultivation, it is often grown in botanical gardens and specialty nurseries."
