    "intro": "Cnicus heterolepis, commonly known as the hairy sandbur, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive bracts. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and roadsides. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture, and its flowers are yellow with prominent white ray florets. Cnicus heterolepis is adapted to dry conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
