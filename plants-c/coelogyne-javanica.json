    "intro": "Coelogyne javanica, commonly known as the Java orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with intricate patterns. Its roots are adapted for attachment to trees and can absorb moisture from the air. Coelogyne javanica is valued for its ornamental beauty and is cultivated for both horticultural and traditional medicinal purposes."
