It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer, adding visual interest to its appearance. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and ability to adapt to dry environments."
