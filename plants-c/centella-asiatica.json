    "intro": "Centella asiatica, commonly known as gotu kola, is a creeping herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white or pink flowers followed by dark berries. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands, forests, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily and form dense mats. Centella asiatica is valued for its medicinal properties and is widely used in traditional medicine systems."
