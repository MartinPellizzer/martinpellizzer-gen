It is characterized by its erect growth habit and distinctive, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color, which bloom during the warmer months. Cladomyza erecta is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
