    "intro": "Cinna pendula var. glomerulata, commonly known as the clustered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to brownish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in wetland areas. This variety is often distinguished by its compact inflorescence and is valued for its ecological role in wetland habitats."
