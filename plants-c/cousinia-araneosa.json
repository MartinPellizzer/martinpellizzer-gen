    "intro": "Cousinia araneosa, commonly known as the spider plant or woolly cousinia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance, with its hairy leaves and delicate flowers, makes it a striking addition to gardens in suitable climates. Cousinia araneosa is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal."
