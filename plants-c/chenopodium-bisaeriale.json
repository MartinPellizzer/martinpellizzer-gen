    "intro": "Chenopodium bisaeriale, commonly known as tumbleweed, is an annual plant belonging to the Amaranthaceae family. It is characterized by its branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces dry, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily, it is considered a weed in many agricultural areas."
