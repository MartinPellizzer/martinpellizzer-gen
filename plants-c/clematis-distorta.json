    "intro": "Clematis distorta, commonly known as the twisted clematis, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, typically arranged in a zigzag pattern along its stems. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are wiry and can become woody with age, and it thrives in partial to full sun with well-drained soil. Clematis distorta is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to climb trellises or other structures."
