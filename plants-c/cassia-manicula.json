    "intro": "Cassia manicula, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its long, pendulous clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has feathery, bipinnate leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Cassia manicula is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
