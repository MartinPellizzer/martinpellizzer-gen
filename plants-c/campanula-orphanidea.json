    "intro": "Campanula orphanidea, commonly known as the rare orchid bellflower, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, preferring well-drained conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Campanula orphanidea is considered a rare and endangered species."
