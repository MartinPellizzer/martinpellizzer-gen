    "intro": "Cereus geometrizans var. cochal, commonly known as the Christmas star cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Mexico. It is characterized by its branched, cylindrical stems that bear clusters of bright red flowers during the holiday season. The plant has thick, fleshy stems adapted for storing water, typical of desert plants. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in bright, indirect light. It is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
