It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale to brownish flowers. This subspecies is typically found in moist, calcareous soils in mountainous regions of Central Europe. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. The plant exhibits rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands."
