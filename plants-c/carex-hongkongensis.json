    "intro": "Carex hongkongensis, commonly known as Hong Kong sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and spike-like inflorescences, which contain small, three-ranked flowers. Native to eastern Asia, particularly China, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in dense, grass-like clusters. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, a common trait among sedges."
