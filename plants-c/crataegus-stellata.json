    "intro": "Crataegus stellata, commonly known as the starburst hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red-orange berries in the fall. The plant has small, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces thorny branches, which are typical of the Crataegus genus. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and full sun to partial shade. Crataegus stellata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing food for birds and other wildlife."
