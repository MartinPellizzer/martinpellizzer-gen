    "intro": "Castilleja racemosa, commonly known as the Indian paintbrush, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright red, brush-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its specialized roots from host plants such as grasses and shrubs. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its striking appearance, it is a popular ornamental plant in gardens and natural areas."
