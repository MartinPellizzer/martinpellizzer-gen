    "intro": "Cactus chloranthus, commonly known as the green cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. Despite its name, it is not a true cactus but a member of the Chloranthaceae family, which is closely related to the cacti."
