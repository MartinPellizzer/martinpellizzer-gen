    "intro": "Campanula filiflora, commonly known as the threadleaf bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered with fine, thread-like hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often hairy, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Campanula filiflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to dry, sunny environments."
