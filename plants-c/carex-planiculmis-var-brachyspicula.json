    "intro": "Carex planiculmis var. brachyspicula, commonly known as the narrow-spike sedges, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and stream sides, and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a single spike of small, three-ranked flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more compact spikelets compared to other Carex species."
