    "intro": "Carex capitata, commonly known as the purple moor grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered spikes of pale purple flowers in the summer. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often found in bogs, fens, and other wetland habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Carex capitata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting diverse wildlife."
