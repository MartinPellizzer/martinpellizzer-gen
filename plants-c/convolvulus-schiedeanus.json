    "intro": "Convolvulus schiedeanus, commonly known as the Schiedea convolvulus, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the bindweed family, Convolvulaceae, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically produces bright yellow or orange blooms, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in coastal and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
