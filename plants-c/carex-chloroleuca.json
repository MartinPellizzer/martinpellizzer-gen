    "intro": "Carex chloroleuca, commonly known as the white-leaved sedge, is a herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are pale green to white, giving it a distinctive appearance, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Carex chloroleuca is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
