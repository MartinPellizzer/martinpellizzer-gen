    "intro": "Combretum obovatum, commonly known as the African flame bush, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of bright red or orange flowers that appear in summer, making it a striking ornamental plant. The leaves are simple, opposite, and ovate to obovate in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in savannas and woodland areas. The plant is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
