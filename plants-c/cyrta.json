    "intro": "Cyrta, commonly known as the Cyrtophora spider plant, is a member of the family Araneae, though it is not a true plant but rather a type of spider. It is characterized by its delicate, silk-like webs that it spins to catch prey. The spider's body is typically small, with a distinctive coloration that can range from brown to yellowish. It is often found in gardens and shrubs, where it can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Despite its name, the Cyrta spider plays an important role in controlling insect populations in its habitat."
