    "intro": "Carex lasiocarpa subsp. occultans, commonly known as the hidden-haired sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it produces distinctive, spiky seed heads. The subspecies occultans is distinguished by its fine, hairy texture and subtle appearance, making it less conspicuous than other Carex species."
