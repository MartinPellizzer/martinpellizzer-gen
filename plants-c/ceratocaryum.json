These plants are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. The genus includes several species, many of which are characterized by their unique, spirally twisted inflorescences. Ceratocaryum species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded conditions. They play an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
