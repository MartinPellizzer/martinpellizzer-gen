    "intro": "Croton phlomoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved croton, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It features opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
