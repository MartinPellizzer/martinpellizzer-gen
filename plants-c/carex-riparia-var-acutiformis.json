It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically sharp-tipped, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are usually clustered in a loose panicle. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
