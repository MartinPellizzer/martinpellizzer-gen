    "intro": "Crocus sativus, commonly known as the saffron crocus, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is renowned for its striking purple flowers and is cultivated primarily for its stigmas, which are the source of the spice saffron. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped blooms with three petals and three sepals, typically in the autumn. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, growing from a bulbous underground stem. The plant's botanical significance lies in its role as one of the most expensive spices in the world due to the labor-intensive harvesting process of its stigmas."
