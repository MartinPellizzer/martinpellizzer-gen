It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers. Its seeds are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source by various indigenous cultures. Coix palustris plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
