    "intro": "Cousinia xanthiocephala, commonly known as the yellow-headed cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its propagation across rocky and sandy soils. Cousinia xanthiocephala is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds."
