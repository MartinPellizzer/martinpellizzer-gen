    "intro": "Cheilanthes odora, commonly known as the fragrant rock fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive, sweet-smelling scent when crushed. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Cheilanthes odora is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping."
