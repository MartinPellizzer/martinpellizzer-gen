    "intro": "Cephalotaxus pedunculata var. sphaeralis, commonly known as the Sphaeralis yew, is a rare and ornamental coniferous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of scale-like leaves arranged in dense, flat sprays. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for various bird species. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
