    "intro": "Cypripedium mastersianum, commonly known as the Masters' lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive pouch-like structure. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its flowers bloom in late summer, and it is pollinated primarily by bees. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
