    "intro": "Calamagrostis sylvatica var. breviseta, commonly known as the dwarf woodland reed, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver on the underside. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging, wet conditions."
