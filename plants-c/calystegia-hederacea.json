    "intro": "Calystegia hederacea, commonly known as creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often opening in the morning. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in fields, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
