    "intro": "Campanulorchis pseudoleiophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bell orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers, which are typically pale green to yellowish in color, adapted for specific pollinators. The plant exhibits a sympodial growth habit, with its roots forming a dense network that helps it survive in its often humid and shaded habitats. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
