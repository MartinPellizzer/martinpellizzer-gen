    "intro": "Cerastium decalvans f. pseudolanatum, commonly known as the pale-stemmed mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the European Alps. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically rounded and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky slopes. This variant is notable for its reduced leaf hair compared to the typical form, giving it a more delicate appearance."
