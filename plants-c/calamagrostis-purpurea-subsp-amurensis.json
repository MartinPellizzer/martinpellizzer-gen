    "intro": "Calamagrostis purpurea subsp. amurensis, commonly known as the Amur reed, is a perennial grass native to eastern Asia. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often silver-white in color. The plant produces dense, spike-like panicles of small, fluffy flowers, typically in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and marshy areas. Its botanical structure makes it well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments."
