    "intro": "Caralluma longecornuta, commonly known as the horned nightshade, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible but have a bitter taste. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. Caralluma longecornuta is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
