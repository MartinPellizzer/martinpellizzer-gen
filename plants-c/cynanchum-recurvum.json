    "intro": "Cynanchum recurvum, commonly known as the Chinese milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is a perennial vine characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
