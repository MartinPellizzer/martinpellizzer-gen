    "intro": "Cereus strictus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and spiny, ribbed structure. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night and remain open for only one night. These flowers are typically followed by red, berry-like fruits. Cereus strictus is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
