    "intro": "Cyanea acuminata f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved Cyanea, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Campanulaceae. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. This plant is native to the Hawaiian Islands, where it grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and rocky areas. It is a rare and endemic species, often found in specific microhabitats on the islands of Maui and Hawaii. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and invasive species."
