    "intro": "Coleus succulentus, commonly known as the Jerusalem artichoke, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often hairy and green to purple in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in the summer, which are followed by edible tubers that are rich in inulin. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy and resilient species. The tubers are not only a food source but also have medicinal properties due to their high inulin content."
