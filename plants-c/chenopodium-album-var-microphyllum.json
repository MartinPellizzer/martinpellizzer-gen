It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with small, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces greenish-white flowers in dense, terminal clusters, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. This variant is distinguished by its smaller leaves compared to the typical var. album."
