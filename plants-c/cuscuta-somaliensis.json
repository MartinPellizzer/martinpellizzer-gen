    "intro": "Cuscuta somaliensis, commonly known as the Somali dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a rapid growth rate, allowing it to quickly colonize new hosts. The plant's stems are covered in tiny, hair-like structures that help it adhere to its host. It is native to arid regions of Africa, particularly Somalia, and thrives in dry, disturbed environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken or even kill its host plants."
