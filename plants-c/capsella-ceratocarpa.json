    "intro": "Capsella ceratocarpa, commonly known as mouse-ear or mouse-ear cress, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 20\u201360 cm, with small, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by distinctive seed pods that are inflated and shaped like a crown. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Capsella ceratocarpa is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and fields."
