    "intro": "Cybianthus vasquezii, commonly known as the Vasquez's lily, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in areas with moderate to high humidity. Its foliage consists of narrow, strap-like leaves that are often evergreen, and it blooms during the spring and early summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Cybianthus vasquezii is considered a vulnerable species."
