    "intro": "Carex pteroloma, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedgewort, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flower heads. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled, spike-like fruits. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable habitats."
