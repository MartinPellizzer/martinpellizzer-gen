    "intro": "Carex fuscula var. pseudextensa, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, thriving in environments with consistent moisture. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its tolerance of nutrient-rich conditions and ability to improve water quality."
