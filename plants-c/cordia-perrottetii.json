It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or lowland areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and as a landscape plant."
