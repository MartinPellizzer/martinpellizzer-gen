    "intro": "Cicuta douglasii, commonly known as the water hemlock, is a highly toxic member of the parsley family (Apiaceae). It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes and stream banks. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters. Its roots contain potent toxins, including cicutoxin, which can be fatal if ingested. Due to its extreme toxicity, it is considered one of the most dangerous plants in North America."
