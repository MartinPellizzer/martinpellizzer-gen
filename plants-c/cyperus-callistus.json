    "intro": "Cyperus callistus, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Cyperus callistus is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments. It is also used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive appearance and adaptability."
