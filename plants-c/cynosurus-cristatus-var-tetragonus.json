    "intro": "Cynosurus cristatus var. tetragonus, commonly known as the four-awned bentgrass, is a grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with four awns on each lemma, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
