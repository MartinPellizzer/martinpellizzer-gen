    "intro": "Cracca rigida, commonly known as rigid cracca, is a species of flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cracca rigida is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment."
