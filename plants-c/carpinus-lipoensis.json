    "intro": "Carpinus lipoensis, commonly known as the Chinese hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its fruit is a small, two-lobed nut enclosed in a spiky husk. Carpinus lipoensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
