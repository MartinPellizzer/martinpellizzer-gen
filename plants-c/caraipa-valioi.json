    "intro": "Caraipa valioi, commonly known as the Caraipa orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andean region of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive inflorescence. The plant typically produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil, often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Caraipa valioi is considered a vulnerable species."
