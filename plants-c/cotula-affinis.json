    "intro": "Cotula affinis, commonly known as the common buttonweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom from spring to summer. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Cotula affinis is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, making it both a common weed and a valuable source of nectar for pollinators."
