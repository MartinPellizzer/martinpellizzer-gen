    "intro": "Cortusa himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Cortusa himalaica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
