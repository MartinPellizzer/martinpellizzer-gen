    "intro": "Chromolaena lepidodisca, commonly known as the roughleaf chromolaena, is a shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. It is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its botanical features make it adaptable to a variety of soil types and environmental conditions."
