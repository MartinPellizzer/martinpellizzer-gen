    "intro": "Carduus helleri, commonly known as Heller's thistle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and large, purple to pink flower heads that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in dry, rocky soils. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Heller's thistle is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological benefits."
