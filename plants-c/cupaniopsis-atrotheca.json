    "intro": "Cupaniopsis atrotheca, commonly known as the black-leafed cupaniopsis, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
