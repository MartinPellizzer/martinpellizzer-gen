    "intro": "Chamaedaphne calyculata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved leatherleaf, is a variant of the evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are broader than the typical variety, often with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white, four-petaled flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its botanical features include a woody stem and the ability to thrive in acidic, wet environments such as bogs and swamps. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
