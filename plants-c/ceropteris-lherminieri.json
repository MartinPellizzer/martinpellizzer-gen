It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used in ornamental water gardens. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Ceropteris lherminieri plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic life."
