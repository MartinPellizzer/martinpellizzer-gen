    "intro": "Carex sendaica var. pseudosendaica, commonly known as the coastal sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in tidal wetlands and coastal areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. The plant plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining wetland habitats."
