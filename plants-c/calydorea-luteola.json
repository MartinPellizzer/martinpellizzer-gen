It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants such as philodendrons and peace lilies. The plant is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which are typically clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Calydorea luteola thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense forests. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and ecological studies."
