    "intro": "Ceanothus pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf ceanothus, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It typically reaches heights of only a few inches, forming dense, mat-like growth patterns. The plant features small, narrow leaves that are often gray-green in color, and it produces clusters of blue or purple flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to rocky or dry environments. Ceanothus pumilus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in arid landscapes."
