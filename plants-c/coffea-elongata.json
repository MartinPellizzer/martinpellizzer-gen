It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy in appearance. Its flowers are white and fragrant, followed by red berries containing the seeds used for coffee production. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of particular interest to botanists and coffee enthusiasts."
