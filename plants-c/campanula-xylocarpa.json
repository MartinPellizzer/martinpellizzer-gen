    "intro": "Campanula xylocarpa, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are usually hairy as well. Campanula xylocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive flowers and hardy nature."
