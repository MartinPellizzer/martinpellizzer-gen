    "intro": "Carex circinata, commonly known as the curled sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Carex circinata typically grows in wet or moist soils, such as marshes and along stream banks. Its distinctive curled leaves and adaptability to wetland environments make it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
