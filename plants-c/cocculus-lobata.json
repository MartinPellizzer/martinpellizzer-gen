    "intro": "Cocculus lobata, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features woody stems with distinctive, spiny nodes and heart-shaped leaves that are palmately lobed. The plant produces showy, pale yellow flowers followed by large, egg-shaped berries that turn from green to bright red as they mature. Its berries contain a single large seed enclosed in a fleshy, orange aril. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is cultivated in some regions for its unique appearance and potential medicinal properties."
