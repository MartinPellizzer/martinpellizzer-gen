It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features fleshy, triangular leaves that are often covered in a whitish coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. Conophytum umdausense is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water to thrive."
