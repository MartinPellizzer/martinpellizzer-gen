    "intro": "Crataegus monogyna plena, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries known as haws, which are edible but typically consumed by birds. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and along coastal areas. The common hawthorn is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
