    "intro": "Claytonia humifusa, commonly known as the Pacific trailing pink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to western North America. It features fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its often rocky or sandy habitats. The plant produces small, showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and is well adapted to cool, moist environments. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for woodland gardens and rockeries."
