    "intro": "Caladium vellozianum, commonly known as the red-tailed caladium, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright red or orange with a contrasting green or white underside. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are not particularly showy. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Caladium vellozianum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant foliage."
