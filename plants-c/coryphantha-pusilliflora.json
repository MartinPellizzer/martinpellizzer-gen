    "intro": "Coryphantha pusilliflora, commonly known as the small-flowered pincushion cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a globular or cylindrical stem that often branches at the base. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. Its succulent leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in arid conditions. Coryphantha pusilliflora is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in desert environments."
