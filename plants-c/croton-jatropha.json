    "intro": "Croton jatropha, commonly known as the poisonwood tree, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, colorful foliage, with leaves that can range from green to red, orange, or even purple, depending on the variety. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing toxic seeds. Its latex sap is highly poisonous and can cause severe skin irritation or more serious health issues if ingested. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided as a food source and is more valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties."
