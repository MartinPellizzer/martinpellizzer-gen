    "intro": "Carex lanuginosa var. americana, commonly known as the American cotton sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early to mid-summer, which are clustered in dense spikes. The species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife."
