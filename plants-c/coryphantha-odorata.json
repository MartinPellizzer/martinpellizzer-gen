    "intro": "Coryphantha odorata, commonly known as the fragrant coryphantha, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in fine, white to grayish spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch of color to its desert habitat. Its leaves are reduced to spines, a common adaptation to minimize water loss in arid environments. Coryphantha odorata is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
