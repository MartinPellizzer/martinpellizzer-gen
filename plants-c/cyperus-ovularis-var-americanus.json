It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. It is often found in disturbed or flooded soils and can form dense stands in suitable conditions. Its botanical features make it a common indicator species for wetland environments."
