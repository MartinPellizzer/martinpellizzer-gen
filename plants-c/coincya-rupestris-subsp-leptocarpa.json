    "intro": "Coincya rupestris subsp. leptocarpa, commonly known as the slender-stemmed waterwheel plant, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, ribbon-like leaves. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. The plant's submerged stems are typically slender and flexible, allowing it to sway with water currents. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is notable for its ability to form dense vegetation, contributing to water clarity and providing habitat for aquatic life."
