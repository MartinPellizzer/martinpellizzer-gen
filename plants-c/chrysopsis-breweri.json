    "intro": "Chrysopsis breweri, commonly known as the Arizona sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its yellow, daisy-like flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, dark seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across open landscapes. Chrysopsis breweri is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
