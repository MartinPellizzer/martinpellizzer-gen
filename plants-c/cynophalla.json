It consists of several species, most of which are native to southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers with bright yellow centers and white or pink petals. Cynophalla species typically grow in dry, rocky habitats and are often used in ornamental gardening. They are also valued for their ability to thrive in arid conditions with minimal water requirements."
