    "intro": "Castilleja lithospermoides var. pastorei, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant features showy, red to orange-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
