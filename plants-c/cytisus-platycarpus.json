    "intro": "Cytisus platycarpus, commonly known as the narrow-fruit broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, oval fruits that mature to a dark brown color, containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Cytisus platycarpus is notable for its hardy nature and ability to colonize disturbed sites."
