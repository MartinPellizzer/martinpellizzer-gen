    "intro": "Cynosurus giganteus, commonly known as giant tussock grass, is a tall, perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It forms dense, tufted clumps with long, narrow leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its robust growth makes it an important component of the local ecosystem and a valuable forage plant for livestock."
