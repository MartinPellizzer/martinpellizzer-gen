    "intro": "Cotinus cotinus, commonly known as the smoke bush, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery panicles that resemble swirling smoke, especially in late summer and early autumn. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early summer, which are followed by red or purple berries. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptical, with a coarsely toothed margin and a smooth, waxy surface. Cotinus cotinus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
