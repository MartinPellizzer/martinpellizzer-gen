    "intro": "Cyclopia capensis, commonly known as the Cape tulip, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, seed-containing structures called cypellets. Cyclopia capensis is also valued for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional African medicine."
