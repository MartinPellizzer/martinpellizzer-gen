    "intro": "Corymbia papillosa, commonly known as the silky gum, is a species of eucalyptus native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a silvery underside that reflects light. Corymbia papillosa is typically found in sandy soils and is adapted to dry, coastal environments."
