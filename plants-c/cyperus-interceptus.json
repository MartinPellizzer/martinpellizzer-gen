    "intro": "Cyperus interceptus, commonly known as the swamp cyperus, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with tall, slender stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Cyperus interceptus thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
