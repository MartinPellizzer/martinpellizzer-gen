    "intro": "Cassiope membranifolia, commonly known as the paperleaf mountain heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a thin, waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its arid or rocky habitats. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
