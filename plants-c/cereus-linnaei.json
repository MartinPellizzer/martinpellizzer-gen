    "intro": "Cereus linnaei, commonly known as the Linnaean cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a columnar cactus with a tall, spiny stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming at night. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry environments. Cereus linnaei is well-suited for xerophytic gardens due to its low water requirements and hardy nature."
