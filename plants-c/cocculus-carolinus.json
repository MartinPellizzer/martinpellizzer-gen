    "intro": "Cocculus carolinus, commonly known as the Carolina cocculus, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and can reach heights of up to six feet. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in racemes, and it produces distinctive, warty fruits that split open to release seeds. The plant has been used historically for its medicinal properties, though its use is now largely restricted due to its toxicity."
