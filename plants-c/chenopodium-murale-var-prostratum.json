It grows prostrate or semi-prostrate, forming dense mats on the ground, and has alternate, ovate leaves with a rough, sandpapery texture. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and is considered a common weed in agricultural settings."
