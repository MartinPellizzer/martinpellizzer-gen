    "intro": "Cardamine flexuosa, commonly known as zigzag watercress, is a small flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its small white or greenish flowers appear in early spring and are clustered in umbels. The species is characterized by its flexible, twisting stems that help it navigate through aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
