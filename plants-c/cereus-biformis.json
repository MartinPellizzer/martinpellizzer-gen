    "intro": "Cereus biformis, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, a feature that attracts nocturnal pollinators. Its flowers are usually short-lived, lasting only a few hours. Cereus biformis is often cultivated for its striking appearance and unique blooming behavior."
