    "intro": "Chrysophyllum longepedicellatum, commonly known as the African star fruit or yellow star apple, is a tropical evergreen tree native to West Africa. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape with a smooth margin. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, star-shaped fruits with a sweet and tangy flavor. The fruit's pericarp is thin and fleshy, containing a single, large, white, starchy seed. It is valued not only for its fruit but also for its ornamental qualities and potential medicinal uses."
