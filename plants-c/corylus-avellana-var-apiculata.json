    "intro": "Corylus avellana var. apiculata, commonly known as the horned hazel, is a variant of the hazelnut tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, pointed nuts that resemble small horns, hence its common name. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers are catkins, typical of the hazel genus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and open forests. The nuts are edible and have been used historically for both culinary and medicinal purposes."
