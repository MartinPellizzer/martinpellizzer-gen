    "intro": "Cordia macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered cordia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of branches. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Cordia macrantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
