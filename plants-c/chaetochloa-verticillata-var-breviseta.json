    "intro": "Chaetochloa verticillata var. breviseta, commonly known as the narrow-settled hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense clusters of small, narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands or along water margins. Its inflorescence consists of compact, cylindrical spikelets that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
