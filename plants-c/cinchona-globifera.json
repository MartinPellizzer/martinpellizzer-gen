    "intro": "Cinchona globifera, commonly known as the globular cinchona, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and large, palmate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and floral display. However, it is not widely used for medicinal purposes like its close relative, Cinchona officinalis."
