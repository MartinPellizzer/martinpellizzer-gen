    "intro": "Cymbidium ixioides, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of China, Korea, and Japan. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces fragrant, lance-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. The plant typically blooms in spring, with the inflorescence consisting of several to many flowers clustered at the end of each stem. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to grow in rocky or well-drained soils. Cymbidium ixioides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
