    "intro": "Cardamine tianqingiae, commonly known as the Tianqingia watercress, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to specific regions in China, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and rocky crevices. Its leaves are often used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
