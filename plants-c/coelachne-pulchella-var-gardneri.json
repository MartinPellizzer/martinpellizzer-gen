    "intro": "Coelachne pulchella var. gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's purplegrass, is a flowering plant species native to southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and striking purple to violet-colored inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its small, spike-like flowers are arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, three-angled seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
