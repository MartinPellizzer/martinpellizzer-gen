    "intro": "Cynanchum carolinense, commonly known as Carolina snakeplant, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright, ridged stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. Its name is derived from the snake-like appearance of its twisted leaves."
