    "intro": "Cladorhiza maculata, commonly known as the spotted sea pen, is a colonial cnidarian found in marine environments. It consists of a central axis with polyps arranged in a feathery pattern, giving it a distinctive appearance. The polyps are capable of extending and retracting to capture prey, primarily small planktonic organisms. Its colonies often form dense clusters on sandy or muddy substrates in shallow coastal waters. The species is characterized by its pale coloration with scattered dark spots, which may serve as camouflage or for species recognition."
