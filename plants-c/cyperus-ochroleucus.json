    "intro": "Cyperus ochroleucus, commonly known as the yellow flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. Its slender, grass-like stems are usually green or reddish, and it produces small, clustered spikelets that are often pale yellow or greenish in color. Cyperus ochroleucus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
