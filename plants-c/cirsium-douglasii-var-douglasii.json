    "intro": "Cirsium douglasii var. douglasii, commonly known as Douglas's thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and large, violet-blue flowering heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and meadows. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in stiff, bristly hairs, which help reduce water loss. The showy flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance."
