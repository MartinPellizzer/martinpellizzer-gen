    "intro": "Conyza salviifolia, commonly known as silverleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Conyza salviifolia is often found in disturbed soils and open areas, making it a common weed in agricultural and roadside environments."
