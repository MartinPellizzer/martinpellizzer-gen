    "intro": "Curcuma glauca, commonly known as blue ginger, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like ginger and turmeric. The plant is characterized by its ornamental leaves, which are broad, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and bloom in clusters, adding visual interest to gardens. Curcuma glauca is often cultivated for its aesthetic value rather than for its culinary or medicinal properties."
