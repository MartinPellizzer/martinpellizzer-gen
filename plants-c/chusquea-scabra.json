It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its stiff, wiry culms and dense foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Its leaves are narrow, pointed, and covered with fine, rough hairs, giving it a distinctive texture.
