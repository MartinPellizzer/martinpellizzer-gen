    "intro": "Capsella procumbens var. integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth weed or small heartweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have smooth, entire margins, giving it its scientific name. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
