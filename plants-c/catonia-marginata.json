    "intro": "Catonia marginata, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its bright yellow, dandelion-like flowers and hairy, lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. It produces a capsule fruit that releases seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. Catonia marginata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
