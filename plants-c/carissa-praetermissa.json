    "intro": "Carissa praetermissa, commonly known as the yellow carissa, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are edible but have a sour taste. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Carissa praetermissa is also valued for its ability to attract birds and insects due to its nectar-rich flowers."
