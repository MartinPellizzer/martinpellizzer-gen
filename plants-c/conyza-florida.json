    "intro": "Conyza florida, commonly known as the Florida ironweed, is an annual flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring rough, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. Its showy purple to pink flower heads bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Conyza florida is often found in disturbed soils, wetlands, and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun."
