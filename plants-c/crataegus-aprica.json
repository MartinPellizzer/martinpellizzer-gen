    "intro": "Crataegus aprica, commonly known as the early flowering hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that ripen in late summer, which are edible but often tart. Crataegus aprica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its cardiovascular benefits."
