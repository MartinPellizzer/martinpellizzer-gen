It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are narrow and lanceolate, often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish down. This variety is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to flourish in alpine or rock garden settings."
