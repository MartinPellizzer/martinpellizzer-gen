    "intro": "Cystopteris guizhouensis, commonly known as the Guizhou water fern, is a species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a finely divided structure that enhances its ornamental appeal. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats."
