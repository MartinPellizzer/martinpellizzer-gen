    "intro": "Coelogyne ophiopogonoides var. kerintjiensis, commonly known as the Kerintjiensis Cymbidium, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its elongated, sword-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows epiphytically on trees, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the surrounding environment. Its blooming period usually occurs during the late winter to early spring, making it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts. Due to its limited natural habitat and threats from habitat destruction, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
