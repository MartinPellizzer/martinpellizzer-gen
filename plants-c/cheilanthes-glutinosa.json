    "intro": "Cheilanthes glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky bladder fern, is a species of fern native to arid and rocky habitats in the Americas. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of fiddlehead-like fronds that remain tightly curled throughout the year. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are typically covered by a protective indusium. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with a waxy coating on its fronds that reduces water loss. This fern is often found growing on rock faces or in crevices, where it thrives in well-drained, sunny environments."
