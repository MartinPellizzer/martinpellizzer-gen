    "intro": "Cuparilla myrtifolia, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant has a complex root system, including pneumatophores, which allow it to absorb oxygen from the air in waterlogged soils. It plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species. Cuparilla myrtifolia is also valued for its timber and traditional medicinal uses."
