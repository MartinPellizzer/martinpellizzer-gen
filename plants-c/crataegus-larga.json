    "intro": "Crataegus larga, commonly known as the large hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. Crataegus larga is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential cardiovascular benefits. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade."
