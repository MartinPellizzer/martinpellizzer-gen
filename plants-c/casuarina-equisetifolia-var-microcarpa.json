    "intro": "Casuarina equisetifolia var. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited she-oak, is a shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive feathery foliage, which consists of reduced leaves arranged in needle-like clusters. The plant produces small, cylindrical cones that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found in sandy or saline soils. This variety is closely related to other casuarina species and is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
