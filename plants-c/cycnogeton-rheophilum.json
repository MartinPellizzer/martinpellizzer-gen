    "intro": "Cycnogeton rheophilum, commonly known as the water thistle, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Cycnogeton rheophilum thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. Its botanical features make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in aquatic botany."
