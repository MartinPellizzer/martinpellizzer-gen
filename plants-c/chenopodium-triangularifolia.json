    "intro": "Chenopodium triangularifolia, commonly known as prickly goosefoot, is a herbaceous annual plant native to North America. It is characterized by its triangular-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, prickly hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and its seeds are typically dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas. Chenopodium triangularifolia is often considered a weed but has been used traditionally for its edible leaves."
