    "intro": "Circaea quadrisulcata subsp. canadensis, commonly known as Canadian whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features slender, hairy stems that often lie close to the ground, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a distinctive white midrib. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is typically found in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides, in meadows, and near water sources. Its subspecific name, *canadensis*, reflects its native range in Canada and parts of the northeastern United States."
