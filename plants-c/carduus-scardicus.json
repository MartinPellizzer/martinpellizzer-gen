    "intro": "Carduus scardicus, commonly known as the southern globe thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its spherical, spiny seed heads and blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and wastelands. Its leaves are gray-green with rough, hairy surfaces and are arranged in a rosette at the base. Carduus scardicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
