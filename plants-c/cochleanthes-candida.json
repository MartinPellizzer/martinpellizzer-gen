    "intro": "Cochleanthes candida, commonly known as the white orchid, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its delicate, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a slight pinkish tinge. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, forming compact pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the base of the plant. Cochleanthes candida thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
