    "intro": "Ceanothus excelsa, commonly known as the tall ceanothus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, silvery hair, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. Ceanothus excelsa is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
