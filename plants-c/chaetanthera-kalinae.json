    "intro": "Chaetanthera kalinae, commonly known as Kalina\u2019s moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night. The plant produces small, yellow berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique blooming pattern and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
