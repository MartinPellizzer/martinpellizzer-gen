    "intro": "Ctenopteris leucosora, commonly known as the white-veined sea\u84b2\u516c\u82f1, is a species of fern native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of white, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and is typically found growing near the shoreline or in shaded, moist areas. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Ctenopteris leucosora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
