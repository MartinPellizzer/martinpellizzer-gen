It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wet to moist soil conditions, often found in marshes, swales, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
