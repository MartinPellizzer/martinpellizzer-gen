    "intro": "Catha wallichii, commonly known as khat, is a flowering plant native to East Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of South Asia. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds, and is characterized by its climbing habit and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves contain psychoactive compounds, primarily cathinone and cathine, which are responsible for its stimulant effects. Despite its medicinal uses in traditional medicine, it is also widely cultivated for its stimulating properties."
