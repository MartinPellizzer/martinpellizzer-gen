    "intro": "Casuarina suberosa var. muelleriana, commonly known as the red-corked she-oak, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its unique, scale-like leaves that are closely arranged around the stems, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. Its corky bark provides structural support and helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions."
