    "intro": "Crotalaria lupinoides, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Africa, Australia, and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow, spurred flowers. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It typically grows in grasslands and disturbed soils, often forming dense stands. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
