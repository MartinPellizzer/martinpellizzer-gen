    "intro": "Commiphora microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited myrrh, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, resinous bark and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsule fruits that release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique chemical composition, it has been used traditionally for its medicinal and aromatic properties."
