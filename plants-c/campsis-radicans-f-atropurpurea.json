    "intro": "Campsis radicans f. atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple flame trumpetvine, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features striking, dark purple to red-bronze foliage that stands out in the landscape, especially during the growing season. The plant produces showy, tubular orange-red flowers in the summer, which attract hummingbirds and other pollinators. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for small spaces, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The varietal form atropurpurea is distinguished by its unique leaf coloration, setting it apart from the typical yellow-green foliage of the species."
