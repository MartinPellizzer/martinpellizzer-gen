It typically grows to a height of 2\u20134 meters, featuring dense, thorny branches and small, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that persist through winter. Its berries are edible but often have a tart flavor, and the plant is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to temperate climates."
