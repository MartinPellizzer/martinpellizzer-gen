    "intro": "Convolvulus suffruticosus var. debilis, commonly known as the creeping bindweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered with fine hairs. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in rocky areas, where it thrives in full sun."
