    "intro": "[WRONG START] Coldingia darwinii, commonly known as the Darwin's coldenia, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking, pale yellow flowers that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in coastal and rocky habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Coldingia darwinii is also notable for its historical significance in the botanical collections of Charles Darwin during his voyage on the HMS Beagle."
