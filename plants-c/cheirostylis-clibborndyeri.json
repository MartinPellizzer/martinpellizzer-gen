    "intro": "Cheirostylis clibborndyeri, commonly known as the Clibborndyer's orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which includes a distinctive labellum and spurred lip. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small, fragrant, and display a range of colors, including shades of pink and white, which help attract pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
