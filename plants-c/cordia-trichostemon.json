    "intro": "Cordia trichostemon, commonly known as the white cedar or white gum tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows up to 10 meters in height, with a straight trunk and smooth, gray bark. The leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, with a leathery texture and a glossy appearance. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense, terminal panicles, producing a distinctive, sweet scent. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal."
