    "intro": "Conyza iliensis, commonly known as the desert fleabane, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a herbaceous annual with small, yellowish-white composite flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss. Conyza iliensis is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in environments with limited water availability."
