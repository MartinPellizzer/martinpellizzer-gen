    "intro": "Conopholis alpina, commonly known as the alpine cow-cup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high elevations of the western United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a distinctive root system that forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption from poor soils. Its leaves are evergreen, and the plant is adapted to cold, rocky environments. Conopholis alpina plays a role in alpine ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as habitat for small invertebrates."
