    "intro": "Cyperus correllii, commonly known as the narrowleaf flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed or open areas with saturated soils. Cyperus correllii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
