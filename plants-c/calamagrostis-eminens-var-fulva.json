    "intro": "Calamagrostis eminens var. fulva, commonly known as the golden bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and its striking golden-yellow foliage, which turns bronze in the fall. The plant produces panicles of small, fluffy flowers that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to gardens and natural landscapes. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. This variety is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
