    "intro": "Callistemon gnidioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bottlebrush, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive red or pink bottlebrush-like flowers that appear in clusters at the ends of its branches. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established. The flowers attract nectar-feeding birds and insects, making it an important plant for local biodiversity."
