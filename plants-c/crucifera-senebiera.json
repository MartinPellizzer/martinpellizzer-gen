    "intro": "Crucifera senebiera, commonly known as the wild cabbage, is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with alternate, rough, and hairy leaves. Its flowers are usually bright yellow or white, and it produces small, round seeds in a dry, pod-like structure. This species is known for its ability to hybridize with other cruciferous plants, contributing to the genetic diversity of the family."
