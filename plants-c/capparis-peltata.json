    "intro": "Capparis peltata, commonly known as the rock caper, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure and has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds. Capparis peltata is adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
