    "intro": "Calanthe davaensis, commonly known as the Davae Orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elegant flower structure with intricate patterns and vibrant colors. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its pseudobulbs and strap-like leaves are adapted to store water and nutrients in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Calanthe davaensis is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
