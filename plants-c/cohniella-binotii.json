    "intro": "Cohniella binotii, commonly known as the two-banded lichen, is a crustose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its distinctive two-toned thallus, with a darker upper layer and a lighter lower layer. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to lichenologists and ecologists studying biodiversity in forest ecosystems."
