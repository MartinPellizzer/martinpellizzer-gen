    "intro": "Coffea bidentata, commonly known as the two-toothed coffee plant, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa and Madagascar. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly rough texture and a distinctive two-toothed appearance on the leaf margins. Its flowers are white and clustered in small inflorescences, followed by red or orange berries containing the seeds used for coffee. While not widely cultivated for commercial coffee production, it is of interest to botanists and researchers due to its unique morphology and potential genetic contributions to coffee species."
