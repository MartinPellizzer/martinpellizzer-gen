    "intro": "Coeloglossum viride var. subalpinum, commonly known as the alpine green helleborine, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. This variant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist habitats such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its morphology reflects evolutionary adaptations to withstand harsh climatic conditions. The plant is often found in mountainous regions of Europe and is of interest to botanists due to its ecological and taxonomic significance."
