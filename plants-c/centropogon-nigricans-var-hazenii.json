    "intro": "Centropogon nigricans var. hazenii, commonly known as the black nightshade or nightshade bush, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its dark purple to black flowers, which bloom in clusters and are typically borne on erect, branched stems. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that turns red when ripe. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and research settings."
