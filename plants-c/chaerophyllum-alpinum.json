    "intro": "Chaerophyllum alpinum, commonly known as alpine chaerophyllum, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its delicate structure, it is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
