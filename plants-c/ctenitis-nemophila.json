    "intro": "Ctenitis nemophila, commonly known as the forest fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dicksoniaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to its structural support, while its fronds are used in traditional medicine in some cultures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
