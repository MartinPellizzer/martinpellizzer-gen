It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and tall, slender culms that often reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in meadows, streambanks, and forest edges. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of pale green to golden florets. This grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
