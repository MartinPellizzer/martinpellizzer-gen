It features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, often displaying vibrant shades of green, yellow, and red. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds.

Due to its striking appearance, it is popular in horticulture but requires well-drained soil and protection from frost."
