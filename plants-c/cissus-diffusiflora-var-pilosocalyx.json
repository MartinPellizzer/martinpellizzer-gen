    "intro": "Cissus diffusiflora var. pilosocalyx, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed devil's backbone, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, and often pubescent stems, which give it its common name. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, while the plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are borne in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
