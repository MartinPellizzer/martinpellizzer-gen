    "intro": "Cuscuta glabrior var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It features slender, yellow or orange stems that twine around its host, often forming a dense, tangled mass. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Its seeds are small and dry, often dispersed by wind or animals. This variant is distinguished by its pubescent (hairy) stems, which set it apart from other dodder species."
