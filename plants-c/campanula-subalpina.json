    "intro": "Campanula subalpina, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Campanula subalpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in alpine ecosystems."
